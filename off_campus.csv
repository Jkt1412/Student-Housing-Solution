Off Campus Living,0,4,Trying to find somewhere away from campus for fall 2019. Village at Colbert Park and The Place at 117 are two of my top choices right now.

Likelihood of acceptance - off campus transfer to UIUC COB?,0,13,"\*Update: I was accepted into Gies COB finance major on 2/2/19\* Good luck everyone! Feel free to message me for advice on the process. 

Original Question:
I am currently a student at Illinois State University planning on transferring to UIUC for the fall 2019 semester and am hoping to get a better idea of my chances of being accepted as a finance major. I was rejected as a freshman applicant, however because I have over 60 credit hours my lackluster ACT will no longer be included in my application, and I have much better experience.

Below I listed a quick summary of my stats to help you get a better feel for my chances.

(Non minority)

A little over 60 credit hours - Fall 2019 at UIUC would start my junior year

Double major: Finance, Accounting

GPA: 4.0

Prereqs:

I will meet all 5 pre reqs upon completion of 2 extra classes this fall.

Extracurricular/leadership

\- Vice President of ISU's student run investment fund

\- Secretary of COB executive board

\- Member of year long research project

Work/internship experience

3. Mid office asset servicing intern at BMO Harris
2. Finance Intern at fortune 500 company
1. Intern at Insurance Broker
Warehouse assistant manager

The reason I am trying to figure this out now is because I have to make the choice of whether I should retake macro and micro this fall to meet their pre reqs to become an eligible applicant(since my micro/macro didn't transfer from ISU)

I was told by business admissions that they typically get 400-700 applicants and that they accept about 100. I feel the main factors hurting my chances will be my non minority status and the fact that I'm coming from a lower tier school (ISU) Any feedback on my chances is greatly appreciated.",96aj1t,UIUC

Off-Campus Housing Internet,1,7,"I'm moving from my apartment to a house in the fall and I'm trying to figure out my options for internet connections. I lived up north in urbana (basically across from Siebel) and my ISP was Pavlov internet. I had a really awesome fiber connection to my apartment building but it was provided by the landlord and the cost was included in the rent. 

This coming fall, the house I'm living in is on the same block and owned by the same leasing agency but we have to provide our own internet. Does anyone living in that area or anyone who has rented a house on campus have any tips or suggestions for ISPs?

Cost analysis of dorm versus off campus - What's the catch?,2,10,"I am looking to rent a 1 br apartment that's close to campus, and I found that the dorm option was consistently the cheapest.

Using Financial Aid for Off-Campus Housing,3,4,"I am living in an apartment next year and have some questions. 

So as I understand it, whatever amount I am currently getting from financial aid for housing, I will also get next year even though I won't be in the dorms. The only difference is that before the money was put into my student account, where it was then deducted by the university for the housing bill. Now the money will be directly deposited into my bank account sometime before the school year starts to be used however we deem fit (presumably for apartments and food). Is this all correct?

My parents are saying that it might be difficult to get the university to give us the money for housing. What exactly is the process for switching the financial aid from being deposited into my student account to being deposited into my bank account? Is it just simply handled by when I don't sign up for any university housing for next year than it automatically switches? Thanks. ",2zej8i,UIUC

Questions from a prospective transfer student,5,3,"I’m a current freshman at a different university, applying to transfer into UIUC in Fall 2020. I’m not super worried about getting in - I was accepted as a freshman but declined the offer, and I’m in good academic standing at my current school. Anyway, I’ve visited the campus and talked with some friends who go to Illinois, but I still have a few questions:

1. Is it easy to make friends on campus? At my current school, people are very unfriendly and keep to themselves. I’m moderately introverted but of course I still enjoy hanging out with people. I can do parties in moderation, but really I’d just love to meet a chill group of friends who like to hang out without all the hoopla of bars and crowded dance floors and loud music. Will I be able to find my people here?

2. What’s safety like? I currently go to school in a big city, and I feel pretty safe on campus but I get nervous walking home from an off-campus location after dark. I have not been a victim of crime, but the crime rate is high, and I have been accosted/sexually harassed, which has made me nervous. Obviously UIUC isn’t in a big city, but I’m nervous about a different type of safety. There’s that whole frat-boy sexual assailant stereotype, and I currently go to a school where frats aren’t a major thing, so I don’t know how much truth there is to that stereotype. How cautious should one be on UIUC’s campus? Would you consider this to be a safe place?

3. What’s something you think I should know about UIUC before becoming a student here?

Today, with some of you coming back, it took 18 minutes of stop-and-go travel to get from 1st Street to the Krannert Center because every time someone stepped off a curb randomly instead of using a crosswalk, the whole column of cars had to stop.

&#x200B;

On the way home, at 11 PM, a young fellow on a Veoride blew through a red light (and a ""no right turn on red"" sign)  into my lane and darn near caused a collision.

&#x200B;

For the next week, there will be thousands of families moving their kids in and many people on the road.  Traffic is going to suuuuuuck already.  Please, please don't make this any worse than it has to be.  Follow traffic laws, even if it's only until the end of the move-in week.",ctbpzs,UIUC
24H Study?,7,4,"I live off-campus, and wanted to know any good places on campus to study since the UGL isn’t 24 hours and closes sooner on Friday/Saturday. Possibly near someplace with coffee? I do my best work very late/very early and keep everyone up at home with the lights on. Thanks!",dd1oek,UIUC
Taking a semester off?,7,6,"I am a student in the college of media. I started out this semester in a rocky place mental health wise, but my parents urged me to return this fall anyways. Since returning to school my issues are so much worse....I have a therapist (off campus, not the counseling center) and doctor monitoring my medication, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. I think I need to take the remainder of the semester off and move home in order to be safe. I of course am going to talk to student services and financial aid regarding this but I’m wondering if any media students have experience with this, and if so what was the process like? I am very sad and scared and just trying to be okay. Thanks in advance",d5kx7m,UIUC
INCOMING FRESHMEN READ THIS: update for 2019,304,35,"In response to the many ""new freshmen"" posts, I thought I'd update the ""freshman FAQs"" posts to more accurately reflect the current state of the university. Hopefully this post (and comments) will be helpful to the future freshmen (and reduce the amount of repetitive posts with solely memes, ""ask your advisor,"" and ""use the search bar"" as responses :)

# CONTEMPORARY FRESHMEN FAQS

**HOUSING**

***What dorm should I choose?***

* There are a few stereotypes associated with each dorm; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/wiki/housing) is still quite accurate to get a sense of that. But in general it doesn't matter as much as you think it does; you'll hang out with people from your dorm for the first 2 weeks, then with people from your major, RSOs, etc for the next for years. Just choose somewhere with air conditioning and you'll be golden. (Choose somewhere without air conditioning and you'll hate your life for 2-ish weeks when it's >90 F, but after that still be fine).

***What should I bring?***

* **Bedding.** Normal Twin XL bedsheets are fine; don't listen to the ""custom sizing"" BS.
* **Appliances.** A fridge and microwave are super convenient to have; get in contact with your roommate to decide who's bringing what.
* **Clothing.** Winters here can be [brutal](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ajk5a7/does_the_university_cancel_classes_due_to_severe/); don't get [caught off guard](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ai5thk/any_advice_on_how_to_survive_the_winter/)  when you get back from Thanksgiving break and it's <20 F for [4 months straight](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/b2tnfl). A good quality coat, hat, gloves, and winter boots, are all essential or you'll hate yourself when you have to walk to a 9am lecture in subzero weather.
* **Computer.** You will honestly be fine with any laptop. If you're in a non-technical major, you could probably even just use a chromebook. Engineering majors might find it more useful to have Windows, but plenty of people still use Macs. If you are doing anything requiring real engineering software you will most likely  want to use the EWS labs or Citrix to connect remotely anyway rather than your own computer. Some people find it helpful to have a desktop in their dorm or apt; this is up to you but probably not necessary unless you're hardcore into gaming or have another use for it. **Regardless, you will most likely be completely fine with whatever you choose.**

***Should I live in the dorms past freshmen year??***

* **No.** Dorms are unreasonably expensive and dining hall food gets old VERY quickly. Get a cheap apartment with your friends,[learn](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/jokaj/students_in_apartments_whats_your_food_situation/) how to [cook](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/9991wo/food_ideas_for_those_living_in_apartments/) some [simple items](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/6w2q77/best_or_easiest_foods_to_make_as_a_first_time/) and revel in the many benefits of being an Actual Adult and living on your own.
* **Helpful resources for apartment hunting:** The [UIUC Tenant Union](https://occl.illinois.edu/) is fantastic: their website has all you will ever need to know about the local apartment market, logistics, past complaints about landlords, etc. Expect to spend about $400-$800 per person per month for a reasonable student apartment with roommate(s). Campustown is a good choice for undergrads, off-campus champaign or urbana is often more grad students and undergrads who want a quieter area. Furnished is usually better, but if you go for unfurnished you can get lots of furniture for cheap when people move out in the spring: join the ""UIUC free & for sale"" FB group. Most people start apartment hunting fall semester for the next year, but there are plenty of units still available later as well, so don't feel pressured to rush into anything you aren't sure about.
* More information about which neighborhoods are good for students: [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/bxvaqv/incoming_swedish_exchange_student_looking_for/eqa6gtp/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/6oh4ux/question_about_good_neighborhoods_to_live/) [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/5x3q0i/new_grad_student_about_to_become_a_uc_resident/)

***Which dining hall food is the best?***

* **Download the UI Dining app.** This will show you the menu at all the dining halls, your remaining meal plan balance for the week, etc. You can also sort according to dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, contains fish, etc) which can be really helpful. In general: Blue 41 is trash, Ike has the largest variety, FAR/PAR is good for late night, Allen/LAR tends to have healthier and/or vegetarian options. Be sure to familiarize yourself with other ""specialty"" locations as well; there's a solid variety throughout campus.

**ACADEMICS**

***Course explorer is overwhelming and I have no idea what classes to pick !! help me!***

* **relax.** everyone is confused freshmen year; your classes first semester aren't going to make-or-break your academic career, just trust what your summer registration advisor tells you (mostly) and you'll be fine. Over time it will get easier as you get a better sense of what you want to do. Getting to know upperclassmen in your major is also key here; they will certainly have valuable advice.
* Some extremely useful resources for future course planning:
   * [GPAs of every course at UIUC](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/) and
   * [Grade disparity between sections at UIUC](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/)
   * If you're in ECE or CS: join the CS advising and/or ECE advising piazza. [Here](http://piazza.com/illinois/other/eceadvising) is the link for ECE.
   * ""Schedule Planner"" on UIUC self-service is your best friend
    * On courses.illinois.edu, if you log into the my.Courses section you can save and mark courses as “favorites” and get email notifications if a seat opens up. 
     * Make a four-year-plan early, keep it updated as your interests/goals change, and discuss it when you meet with advisors. Get used to being proactive about keeping on track; as a student it is YOUR responsibility. 

***Should I take the proficiency exam for this course?***

* **Yes. S**ometimes advisors will tell you to retake calc II or something; **don't.** If you have APs or time over the summer to prepare for the proficiency, take the credit and run. Not having to worry about bullshit like CHEM 102, the calc sequence, etc, will make your year 1000% less stressful, and you'll be able take interesting advanced classes a lot sooner. Almost all intro classes (physics and math for sure) have tons of practice exams online you can use to study.

***Should I take 20 credit hours, join 12 RSOs, and quadruple major in CS, ECE, Math, and Physics??***

* **No.** We get it, you were the Smart Kid ™ in high school; most of the people here were too. College courses are **very** different than high school, and living on your own is also a big adjustment for most freshmen. Do yourself a favor and take it slow your first semester to make sure you get off to a strong start. If you find that you thrive here, there's plenty of time to be ambitious later.

***I'm iN PrEp and want to tRaNsFeR to CS or ECE***

* Read ALL of these: [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/c3atp8/son_wants_to_major_in_computer_science_talk_to_me/)  [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7k4p23/to_all_the_new_admitted_students_who_are_in_dgs/)  [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a6gpfi/note_to_class_of_2023_trying_to_transfer_into/)  [\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/5j95rc/if_you_are_admitted_undeclared_into_uiuc_do_not/)  [\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/5j2qp8/kids_who_are_in_prep_and_want_to_do_csbioemeche/) first, and then re-think your decision. it is EXTREMELY difficult and a very stressful way to spend your freshmen year. Again, maybe you were the Smart Kid ™ in high school; that's great, we all were. Maintaining a sky-high GPA is NOT as straightforward as you think it will be.
* That said, don't let the meme of ""CS/ECE transfer is impossible"" dissuade you from applying completely, as **long as you have a backup plan if you don't get in.** I personally was able to transfer into ECE this semester, so it's not impossible, but be prepared to really work if that is what you want to do. In my case, I also wasn't in PREP -- I came from another engineering major that is EE-adjacent enough that even if I hadn't been able to transfer, I could still pursue what I am interested in. I would be ***extremely*** hesitant about trying to transfer if you are in DGS/PREP and don't have a solid alternative like I did.

***Why are textbooks so expensive?????***

* They aren't if you know what you're doing..... again upperclassmen friends are key for getting cheap textbooks and finding ""definitely-not-pirated"" PDFs. I also recommend [Abebooks](https://www.abebooks.com/) (lots of cheap international editions for engineering textbooks) and [Thriftbooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com/) (more humanities stuff) as a source for textbooks that are much cheaper than the campus bookstore.

**CHAMPAIGN-URBANA PRO TIPS**

**Transportation**

* **The MTD** is a [fantastic resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/4wyqmt/freshmen_psa_we_have_an_amazing_bus_system_get/). The [trip planner](https://mtd.org/maps-and-schedules/plan-trip/) is shockingly user friendly: type in a starting and ending destination and approximate time and it will tell you exactly which bus to take. You will also find that getting to know Champaign-Urbana as a whole (landmarks, a few general street names, etc) will benefit you a lot, as will knowing a few basic bus routes by heart that you use often.
* **You should also download** the ""Transit for CUMTD"" app; it is super convenient to know when buses will be arriving at your stop. The buses are honestly not usually on schedule but the app itself is extremely accurate in terms of when they will arrive. Also, I think this app was actually developed by a UIUC student a few years ago which is kind of cool.
* **Get a bike and high-quality U-lock.** Having a bike makes navigating campus 10000% easier, particularly when you're a freshman with classes across campus and a 10-min break in between. The U-lock is important because chain bike locks can easily be broken (source: I thought my bike was safe with a thicc cable lock but it got stolen a few weeks ago, don't make my same mistakes). Also, register your bike [here](https://campusrec.illinois.edu/programs/bike-registration/) so if it ever gets picked up by campus police or stolen or whatever it will get back to you more easily. If you want a free bike light go [here](https://icap.sustainability.illinois.edu/project/light-night); page linked is for 2018 but this event occurs every year.
* **Don't bring a car.** Parking is expensive and difficult to find and driving through campus is annoying. Unless you're living somewhere way off campus (ie, >20 minute MTD ride) there is very little reason to have a car; it will be much easier, cheaper and less stressful to just walk/bike/bus wherever you want to go. Apartment dwellers may find it useful for grocery shopping, but it's not essential.
* **Download the Veoride app.** I know it's a meme, but if you're ever in a pinch it can come in really handy.

**Food/Groceries**

* The County Market on campus is good in a pinch but in general prices are a little exorbitant. Urbana Meijer, Aldis,  various Walmarts are only a bus ride away and a much better choice for affordable grocery shopping. Aldi's is probably cheapest overall. In the summer/early fall (May-October), the [Urbana Farmer's Market](https://urbanamarket.org/) happens every Saturday if you're into cheap vegetables and other hipster-ish items.
* Lots of good and up-to-date advice in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/bymsft/cheap_but_good_lunch_on_campus/) regarding restaurants/food on campus as well.

**Health**

* [McKinley](https://mckinley.illinois.edu/) is not super great but they will give you a free ""Cold Pack"" every semester that has ibuprofen, cough medicine, cough drops, decongestants, so definitely take advantage of that. It is also a good resource for flu shots, contraceptives, etc.
* [The Counseling Center](https://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/) can be pretty hit-or-miss, not gonna lie, but it's still worth a shot if you're feeling overwhelmed by school/life/etc. They schedule appointments on a same-day basis so from what I've heard you need to call them pretty early in the morning to get an appointment.

**Social Life**

* **Don't be a recluse in the dorms.** Some of the dorm-organized events are extremely cheesy, but at least make some effort to get out and meet people. They probably won't become your lifelong friends, but it's nice to have a group to hang out with during the first few weeks of the semester. It can seem nerve-wracking when it seems like everyone else already has their own groups, but in reality, all the freshmen are in the same boat -- no one's going to think it's weird if you strike up a random conversation in the dining hall or something during those first few days.
* **Join RSOs.** Go to quad day and get on the email list for literally everything that even sounds remotely interesting, then choose a few to actually commit to. A good place to start is one academic/technical/professional group and one that's more social. You'll be able to meet people and also do get some technical experience to boost your resume, which is especially important as an underclassman.
* **Form study groups with people in your major.** Being antisocial and doing everything yourself is a recipe for some painful semesters at UIUC; having a reliable set of people to motivate and help you study will definitely pay off in the long run.
* **Be smart about alcohol and other substances.** College might be the first time you have the freedom to go out whenever you want! Have fun, but make responsible choices about where you drink and who you drink with (apartment parties/pregames with upperclassmen friends? probably a safe bet. Drinking in the dorms? a little more risky depending on your RA). If you're planning on going to bars and aren't 19 yet, be aware that campus police are pretty vigilant about fake IDs, so if you have one don't use your real name and don't be surprised if it gets confiscated.

Uiuc housing stores screwing with you,0,8,"The stores of UIUC housing do not give you paper bags for the things you buy. If they charge you 30~40% more than the regular off campus stores, shouldn't they provide this basic fundamental thing? As any customer of the world, you are not supposed to hand carry things you buy without the bags. Customer is the king here too. 

How do I make a formal complaint to the university effectively? I feel Housing office will dismiss this as just another complaint by some student. Which place do I complain to, so that they will feel the most urgency ? Thanks",d9tj42,UIUC
Does anyone else get the feeling that there’s a UIUC Apartment housing bubble?,25,9,"Is anyone else getting the feeling that there’s a housing bubble expanding on campus? These new ‘casual modern luxury’ apartments are starting to pop up everywhere for a minimum of around $620 a month, and new neighborhood type cottages like what’s advertised by the Retreat basically constructed a neighborhood off campus that is still under construction and likely not fully leased? It just seems off to me.",crd89z,UIUC

How to buses affect the issue of students having trouble making friends on campus? Idle thoughts.,0,9,"Did students attending prior to the current bus service have greater opportunity to meet or walk and talk as they moved about campus. Do students riding buses today engage in social interactions to the degree those who walk do (or did in the past)? Do the jump on - and then jump off a few blocks later - ride styles one often sees on campus allow for the kinds of interactions once more common among students?

Bus service on campus as we know it started to develop in the late 1980’s but it took years to reach the density and frequency in place today. Prior to this students would walk (though certainly some biked) back to dorms for lunch and again for supper in the evening. They rarely rode a bus between classes as few city buses ran optimized routes for such movement. Campus was not too much bigger then. North of Springfield there were already a few academic buildings and the south quad was starting to fill out south of Mumford. Dorms were where they are now. Fewer lived in apartments well off campus.

Just wondering how often folks walk back to their dorm with someone they know from class - now vs 40 years ago?",d20pqf,UIUC
"Single semester lease advice for incoming exchange student? On campus or off, will explore all options.",3,5,"Hello,

As my last posts indicate, I'm a UK exchange student coming to UIUC this Fall semester for just a one-semester exchange and I need to look at sorting out housing. I am open to on-campus or off-campus accommodation, have heard about the pros and cons of both - ideally I'd take something as affordable as possible provided it doesn't endanger my life or leave me too far from campus.

Applying to UIUC?,1,17,"I’m interested in the Higher Education Masters program (degree for uni staff, directors, advisors, etc). So I’m not an undergrad student, but do have some very undergrad-like questions!

How is the campus? Faculty? Student life? Off-campus housing? Traffic? Restaurants/shopping/leisure activities/etc? I’ve only been to Chicago and Arlington Heights in Illinois, so how is the city in the area as well?

Also, a more specific question, but do students tend to get jobs in the Urbana Champaign area or do students tend to leave the area or even full-out leave Illinois more?

For any grad students out there, does anyone know the average GRE score accepted? UIUC’s website mentions nothing besides a minimum 3.0 GPA for my program.

"DAE think fast food in CU has plummeted in quality, value and customer service?",13,10,"I think it has been happening for the last 2-3 years, but the last few months it's been the worst.

Off-campus I have noticed the fast food prices are higher, lower in quality, portion or both and and customer service has plummeted into ""Screw the customer"" territory. I think part of the reason is they are all hiring and, I imagine, not paying well. They are constantly understaffed and the people who are there are stressed-out and feel exploited.

3. Should I reconsider moving out after Fall and just toughing out Spring semester to wait out more listings?

"Off Campus Housing, Piss from Ceiling",9,2,"So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but yeah...

My boyfriend and I live off campus in an apartment with our own room, and two other rooms with roommates in each. Last weekend, we had piss coming from our ceiling. Literally piss yellow. A lot. The first time it happened, it was night time. We didnt know why it was happening, my boyfriend tried calling our landlord repeatedly who didn't answer. We put buckets under the spots where it was leaking and towels on the floor to sleep up the excess. After an hour or something, it stopped. The next day, the landlord responded saying that the plumber would arrive sometime Monday. I mopped up, tried cleaning the room, and we told our roommates to stop using the bathroom/kitchen sink upstairs. One of them forgot and flushed the toilet and we had  another nice piss rain the day after the first. Repeated what we did the first time and this time realized the bathroom was flooding (so we figured it was a toilet issue) and waited for it to stop, then cleaned up again.

Plumber finally came 7:30 am Monday (our landlord never told us what time) and we had to suddenly move all of our stuff ourselves to our roommate's room. The plumber said it was the result of us clogging the toilet. They were workingthere all day so my bf and I hung out in our roommate's room and in the rest of the apartment and casually heard them say ""People are so stupid"" (probably referring to us, so professional). They didn't leave until the afternoon and it was supposedly fixed by then. Our room was covered in debris from where they had torn a hole in the wall, and they started painting and left without finishing so our room was dirty and full of paint fumes even after trying to ventilate it all evening. Asked the landlord if we were expected to sleep there, he basically said it wasn't his problem and the way he talked made it seem as though he blamed us for it. Being poor college kids, we slept there. Rest of the week, we waited for painters to randomly show up since our landlord never kept us informed of when they would come, they showed up on Tuesday and didnt come back for the rest of the week. Yesterday, I started moving stuff in from our roommate's room (none of the rooms are affected besides ours btw) and I cleaned everything, washed all of our piss water covered clothes and bedding, my boyfriend replaced his piss covered computer chair with another one, cleaned the bathroom, mopped everything and disinfected everything, and everything seemed okay. Until tonight. Roommate flushed the toilet, and suddenly it flooded the bathroom again and piss has been pouring from light fixtures and other parts of the ceiling. The first time, it got on the floor, bedding, desk, pc chair, clothes. Second time, the same stuff + my monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This time, it got on my boyfriend's laptop, mouse, floor, bedding. I don't know what to do. We tried contacting the landlord again repeatedly, but I think he purposefully turned his phone off. Why should a clogged toilet cause piss water to leak from the bathroom through our ceiling? Less than 5 days passed after they supposedly fixed it and we have to deal with this again. I honestly dont think it's just a clogged toilet if it happened again so soon and everyone has been careful with what they flush. This is all so frustrating and unprofessional. What are our options?

TL;DR: Piss water coming from ceiling over me and my bf's belongings repeatedly, landlord supposedly got it fixed and blamed us probably, less than a week later it's happening again. What do we do",9vseij,berkeley

Question about paying for off campus housing,0,7,"hey guys.

This is my first year at CAL. I am currently living in the dorms right year but am planning to move to an apartment the next. I already have a place in mind for around $730 (is this alot?). but am hesitant on the procedure that most students use to pay for their apartments who are virtually dependent on financial aid . Since my parents are currently unemployed, they will be unable to help with the rent, thus my EFC is 0. My question is, how will i get the financial aid money to pay the rent of my apartment? will this happen through a refund on CARS? And if so, will it happen before the first of every month, the date that my rent is due?

i know these are a lot of question but i am just completely lost right now. thanks

My roommate is someone who’s supposed to be my “friend” but shes one of those REALLY selfish and kind of evil-souled people who wont be nice to you unless you have anything to offer her. This turned into her discluding me w our other friend. Its like well be good friends one sec and the next shes so cold and mean??? It hurts. So i dont want to rely on her for anything anymore.

Unpopular opinions thread,106,136,"I've seen these on a number of other subreddits but never on here, so I figured it'd be somewhat interesting.

Here are mine:

1) With how large the CS major is and how constrained classes are, the gpa cap should be raised to 3.5. I think this would also equalize the disparity of ""student quality"" between CS and EECS. (And I say this as an l&s cs major).

2) Grade deflation (specifically within the cs major) is very overrated. Most of our classes curve to a B+; most other departments curve to a B-. (I think there's an argument to be made that CS/EECS classes have better students on average, but I haven't taken enough classes outside of the major to know for sure.)

3) (probably not controversial on this subreddit but probably is on campus) most of the clubs on campus are a bunch of prestige-hungry jerk-offs trying to roleplay silicon valley. The whole culture behind them (like ""coffee chats,"" ""retreats,"" etc.) just seems over-the-top. Also, objectively speaking, spending 15 hours a week coding for a club for free seems like a poor use of time. afaik the only tangible benefit you can get out of these is probably networking/referrals, but there are far less time-consuming ways of doing that.

4) The dorms just aren't worth living in. Even for freshmen. The food sucks, they're horrifically cramped, the ""dorm life"" is very overrated (at least in my experience), and they're ridiculously overpriced compared to off-campus housing. If I had to do it over again, I would *definitely* spend my freshman year in an apartment off-campus. I'd get a single for less money too. If you value privacy/alone-time at all, you probably won't like the dorms very much.",bs9vjl,berkeley

A lot of them ditched after the first day until there was legit less than 10 ppl in my group and they all keep to themselves. I did talk to some people in my group the first day and it seemed like we connected well, but then they stopped showing up to GBO.

I spent a lot of time this week sitting by myself either at MLK or at my apartment alone, and it really hurts seeing other GBO groups, even transfer groups, clicking well and doing things together off GBO time like getting boba together or whatever. I really wanted to go to the fun late-night events, but didn't because I didn't have anyone to go with. I literally wanted to cry so much this week because I've dreamed about coming to Cal my whole life and this is the reality.

I'm extremely shy, introverted, and not into partying, so it took a lot for me to get out of my comfort zone and to even talk to people this week, but I don't know what else to do. I feel so disappointed in myself because GBO is almost over and I should've been more outgoing.

What's the support system and social life like at Cal?,10,7,"I am an incoming freshman. This is my basic worry:

I was trying to install python today to learn. I spent hours on the internet and asking my CS friends before I actually figured it out.

I come from small tight-knit residential school (where everyone knows everyone) and it has small class sizes. Further, all the teachers stayed on the campus. If I had faced such a problem in my school, I could have walked down to my computer teacher's office, knocked on his door, and asked him for help.

I'm worried that this won't be the case at Berkeley. I obviously can't just walk into my professor's office and ask him for help with installing Python.

I just want to know: what's the support system that way at Berkeley. If I have problems with problem sets or even general life/career problems, is there anyone I can approach.

One more thing: what's social life like beyond parties? Like in my school, we would hang out in our common room with a guy on the guitar, all of us singing some song. Some guys would be playing pool and some guys playing Xbox. Friday nights would be spent sitting in some guys' room gossiping about life. Is there any atmosphere like that at Berkeley at all?

Not even getting into the off-campus meal plans (don't pay to eat at a dining hall when you don't have to), the on-campus plans for next semester are hot garbage. Here, I'm going to highlight one particular way which Cal Dining is not-so-subtly trying to shaft the incoming class of 2023 and all future Berkeley students.

Witness: [2019-2020 Cal Dining on-campus meal plans.](http://www.google.com) You don't actually have to read this; I will tell you what to be angry about.

We're not even going to look at the unlimited plan. We're going to hone in on *one single phrase* listed under the Gold Plan, a supposed upgrade from the baseline Blue Plan: ""More value.""

Here's the rundown on what the Blue and Gold plans get you:

* The blue plan gets you 12 swipes per week plus $600 in flex dollars. Sure, fine. This has been ample for most freshman this semester as far as I know.
* The gold plan, for $350 more per year, gets you 10 swipes per week (yes, a downgrade) and $1000 in flex dollars.

This is absolutely preposterous. First, let's note that if you straight-up purchase flex dollars, $350 in real cash gets you $385 in flex dollars. So in effect, paying the $350 for the Gold plan gets you $15 more in flex dollars at the cost of 2 meals per week (32 total given a 16-week semester).

What's the value of 32 meals? Nominally, $192, assuming you buy them with flex points at the average price ($6, from the same webpage).

So, __by paying for a $350 upgrade, you lose ~$200 of value__. This is absurd. Please complain to Cal Dining, and freshmen/transfers, don't go for the ""upgrade;"" you're far better off simply buying flex dollars.



And yes, I hear you say ""but swipes are worthless, I would never use mine up! Even $15 extra is technically worth it!"" Perhaps you and your unending supply of money (imagine: even if a student works, perhaps it's better for them to preemptively pay off their pile of debt than to spend money on restaurants when they're food is already given) permit you to eat out countless times per week, but the reality is that many students rely on their meal plans to feed them, especially during their freshman year. A side discussion might be of why any student in University housing should ever have food insecurity given they __have__ to have a meal plan. And to boot, if you use all of your swipes in only __3__ weeks per semester, the Blue plan instantly becomes a better deal than the Gold plan. 

Go bears.

Want to do something real about it? I do! This is the official thing: (though in my personal opinion, using official forms is the easiest way to get your feedback thrown out.

Also, do any off campus students have any tips for looking for a place?  So far, I've found a lot of places that seemed too good to be true (""1br/1ba, pets allowed, parking for 2,000; just pls send 1st month and holding fee prior to seeing the place""), so I've been avoiding stuff like that.

1. What is the process to getting into an actual major?
2. I’ve heard about grade deflation and the competitive atmosphere at cal, but is it as prevalent in upper division classes? Also is it also super cutthroat in the history dept. or the greater college of L&S?
3. How’s the school/social life balance for non-stem majors? Or just in general? 
4. I chose off campus housing on my app because On campus apartments look too expensive... is it hard to find a decent room to rent or double in? Any housing recommendations?

It's time we build housing on People's Park.,111,86,"Hey all. Interested in how students and residents feel about housing on top of people's park given that the motions to begin construction are starting to begin. So far, literally all the students I have talked to about it are completely for development, but residents are not.

I personally don't understand why Cal should be forced to keep their property undeveloped and crime-ridden while we face some of the worst on-campus housing of any other top school. It seems like our city council loves to play up political noise and make development harder and the university's job ten times more difficult (from milo riots to housing).  


What are your thoughts? What can we do about safety and housing, arguably our two biggest problems off campus ?

EDIT: in 2017, the police were called to the park 1,600 times. One time, a homeless women was feeding METH to a baby. So yes, this is what we need (http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/05/03/new-uc-berkeley-plans-for-peoples-park-call-for-student-homeless-housing/).",94o6nb,berkeley

How to make friends at Berkeley as a sophomore?,37,6,"Last year I lived on-campus and it was pretty cool. I became friends with most of my floormates and we would spontaneously hang out/eat together every day simply because of the close proximity. To be honest, I don't know why people don't like to live on campus second year (it isn't thaaat hard to get on-campus housing, you just have to be ok with something shitty like a triple in U3). Only after moving off campus did I start to miss living in close proximity to all my friends and not ever having to cook or clean. I applied to live on campus last year, and got an offer at U2, but ultimately decided against it because I realized none of my friends were living on campus again.

&#x200B;

However, basically the only friends I made freshman year were my floormates. I now live off campus in a single with some housemates that I am only acquaintances with (I decided not to live with my friends because I had problems with their cleanliness). I still meet up with my old floormates like once every other week or so and we have a semi-active group chat, but I feel like I don't really have friends anymore. 80%+ of the days I won't talk to anyone in real life because I will just wake up, go to class, come home and make/eat lunch by myself, go back to class, go to Moffitt to study, come home and make/eat dinner and then just chill out for like 2 hours before I go to sleep. I would eat out, but I kind of see eating out as a social event and tbh I have nobody really to eat out with besides once like every two weeks when I get together with my old friends. It's really lonely. I used hang out with friends like 3 hours a day at least, but now it's almost none (doesn't help that I live really south (almost Elmwood)).

&#x200B;

I really feel like my social life, although not nonexistent, is very inadequate. I've tried making more friends through like clubs and stuff, but I'm not the most outgoing person and most of the time I'm kind of awkward and aloof, so the people I meet in clubs just become acquaintances I wave hi at when I see them on Telegraph, but nothing really more. I think part of it may have to do with the fact that I've tried only the nerdy clubs like OCF and other engineering related stuff, but  as a nerdy EECS major, most of the more socially active ""professional interest"" clubs are not really what I'm looking for. Also, I haven't found a club that I super vibed with. Obviously there's stuff that's impossible to get into like consulting or stuff like Codebase, but I'm really not that smart or charismatic, so I don't think it's something I can count on. Should I join something like AFX or KASA, a club that is primarily a social club? I want to be invited to parties and kickbacks and stuff and I could see myself having fun doing things like dancing.

&#x200B;

I guess the problem I have is that I have a couple old floormates that I consider good friends, but only really meet up with rarely now because they seemed to have moved on in their lives, and some acquaintances from clubs that I say hi to, but I really want more friends that I can hit up and do fun things with. I'm quite lonely because it can a whole week before talking to someone I know. How and where do I find people to hang out with?",9wdale,berkeley

I'm going to start a part time job at FedEx this Tuesday up until August to have some money on me. I applied for housing but as far as I know, housing isn't guaranteed like at other UCs such as Irvine. How likely is it for a transfer student to be offered housing? I've looked into off-campus housing options which I know are much cheaper but the majority of them have leases that have already started or start in June/July, and again, I'm broke at the moment. I would only have enough money in August. Should I be worried?

Why does Cal handle housing and finances so poorly?,6,14,"Why is it that Cal's ""estimated cost of housing"" (which was used to determine my financial aid) is completely unrepresentative of how much it costs to live here? I applied for University run housing for next year (selecting all of the cheapest options first and then any room/size as a last resort) and was only offered a Unit 3 double, which costs $17,000 a year, yet when they ""estimated"" the cost of living for next year, they claim it is $13,000 with food or $9,000 without. Because of this change in ""estimation"", my financial aid will be reduced by several thousand dollars next year not because something changed on my FAFSA, but because they think I'm suddenly somehow paying was less to live here next year than I already currently do whilst simultaneously only offering me housing that is insanely expensive? I've been looking for off campus housing all semester, and especially now since the on campus housing I was offered is too unaffordable, yet it still does not seem like there's any way for me to afford to come back to Cal next year with my financial aid so heavily reduced based on some ""estimation"" that assumes I will be able to find some much cheaper housing for next year. Sorry for ranting, I'm just scared and panicking that I might have to drop out of college because of this nonsense.

Physically threatened and attacked by a homeless person on Telegraph,102,20,"Today, after an uneventful year at Berkeley, I was attacked by a homeless person. I was physically threatened, shoved, and verbally abused while punches flew by inches away from my face.

I realize that this, in comparison with the dozens of unopened Nixle alerts with scary titles in my inbox, is as tame as it gets, but I really had believed that walking with a group of people on Game Day at 8 in the morning should have prevented this from happening, especially because I've definitely taken riskier walks alone.

Who would just go out of their way to cross the street and proceed to shove and shout at random busy people walking by, carrying boxes and equipment? Is it because we somehow offended you by *daring* to walk down Telegraph as the shortest route to our destination on campus?

I sympathize with those who are less fortunate than I am, but **victimhood doesn't give you the excuse to be an asshole**, and definitely not somehow justify violently lashing-out towards others.

How do you deal with someone who clearly is not reasonable and is actively threatening you? Do you try to talk them down? Do you stand up for your friends when they are shoved around? What do you do in those tense moments after you contact the UCPD? What do you do when all of these tactics don't work?

I'm just confused and honestly angry that I was powerless in resolving a situation that really shouldn't have happened at all. I feel disgusted by the fact that all I could do was stand by while he went off on ""you asians"" and how the police can't even touch him.

I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,364,307,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it.

Thanks so much and ask away!

on vs off campus as a freshman?,4,12,"Pretty much everywhere I look, the consensus seems to be that living on campus is much better as a freshman.

I'd be living with at least two other students and a much larger living space with a private bed and bath as well as a kitchen for less money, does socialization in on campus living outweigh that?

(x-post r/austin) Outrageous water bill off campus--512 Realty,7,9,"So I'm a student renting a studio in a Hyde Park complex that was recently bought out by 512 Realty, and per my new lease agreement I now have to pay for water. My most recent water bill was $107--for a 400 sq ft studio apartment. My parents don't even pay that much for their house, including the cost of watering the lawn.

I've called 512 directly and they claim that the charges assigned to each individual are based on the total average usage of the entire complex. The problem is that there are no water meters on the property so my neighbors and I have no way to prove how accurate these charges are. Are these prices normal for the area? And if not, is there anything I and my fellow renters can do about it?

EDIT: Hey thanks everyone for the responses! I've been on the phone with them again and they were finally pressured into getting a plumber to go to each property in the next few weeks in order to check for leaks and broken pipes.

Now students have to find other parking that's even more inconvenient and far or give UT even more money by parking in the garages.

For those that don't drive to school and may not be able to empathize/understand, some students may drive for reasons like cheaper housing farther from UT, a possible off-campus job, no reasonable access to a bus stop, etc. 

Those that drive to school know it was already a bloodbath finding parking.

registering someone else's vehicle?,3,2,"I've been using a parking pass to commute to UT from off campus, but I'm moving into a co-op next semester, which means I don't need the pass and I'll have a permanent parking space. The thing is, I'll still have an active parking permit, and I'm able to register more than one vehicle, so can I use it to register my girlfriend's vehicle so she'll have parking when she comes to visit? I don't want her to have to pay for street parking every time she comes to see me, since co-ops don't have any overnight visitor parking or anything like that. As long as her license plate is registered on my UT Direct, do y'all think I'll be okay? The website says you can register up to three vehicles, and I doubt anyone has three whole vehicles titled under their name, so this provision seems to allow registration of vehicles that are not yours.

Figuring out housing for 2020/2021 (late in the game),5,2,"So essentially I haven't been paying much attention to where I will be living next year.

I have historically been slow to make a friend group upon at arriving at a new school, and UT Austin has been no exception (I'm still just a freshman, I'll get there). Therefore, I currently lack a roommate(s). At the same time, my parents are being somewhat pushy about me getting roommates to lower the cost of housing. When I've gone on the Facebook groups for finding roommates, the vast majority of posters have been girls, which rules out that option for me.

Because of that, I haven't gone to a realtor/apartment locator yet, because I don't know what I'm looking for in terms of number of people. My current plan right now is to scam my parents over Thanksgiving into freeing me from the restraints they've given me in terms of finding roommates, but I don't know what the chances of success are on that.

So essentially three questions:

1.) How to find roommates?

2.) Any recommended realtor/apartment locator?

Upper year off-campus residence pros and cons??,6,6,"I’m going into 2A in a couple of days and would like some insight about the upper year residence experience. I lived in REV last year and it was ok. Now for 2nd year I decided to stick with UW res and chose to live in UWP.

I did some quick maths, and UWP is about $1k per month for fall and $700 for winter/summer. I’ve read that the rent in off campus places are cheaper, for example $700-800 in 295 Lester.

Is the cheaper rent (compared to UW residence) really worth the hassle/problems? Looking at the posts on this subreddit and the google reviews for these off-campus places has caused me avoid them.

Longboarding in Aggieland: A Guide to Longboarding On and Off Campus,48,6,"**Intro**

With lots of freshman just beginning their college career and many others returning for another year there will inevitably be lots of people looking for a quick way to get to class. Longboarding is an effective way to cut down the commute whether you live on campus or off. I've been longboarding to class for years so I thought it would be helpful if I shared what I learned over my experiences. I'm going to be a senior this year (compE) and have been longboarding since high school when I did downhill and cruising. I started longboarding to class the first week of my freshman year and since then have ridden the following 6 semesters and just a few months ago broke the 1000 mile mark. Name any place on or off campus and chances are I've longboarded there at some point. 

**The Board**

Having the right board is going to be the difference between a quick and easy ride to class and a face full of gravel. If you plan to ride your board every day you should expect to invest $100-$200 in a good board. 

*Board Style*

Skip the penny board. Our roads and sidewalks are notorious for sucking. You're going to regularly be riding over cracks, bumps, sticks, and uneven ground. There isn't really a good way around this sadly and as such you should have a board capable of dealing with it. For riding on campus I always recommend a full size longboard. Penny boards are just too small, you are going to eat shit on a regular basis. Nickel boards are a little better but while you might gain a little bit of being able to get over bumps you are still not going to be doing too well. The best board that wont require you to focus 95% on not falling off the board is something with a 30""+ wheelbase. 

In addition to traditional longboards, you also have skateboards, schlongboards (yes, thats a real thing), and electric longboards. Skateboards... well they suck for riding on campus. The wheels are small, wheelbase is short, and they just aren't comfortable for long rides. A schlongboard is a skateboard with the trucks moved onto the tail and nose to widen the wheelbase. This is actually a decent option but I'd not recommend this unless you already have a skateboard. If you want to do this I'd suggest getting a pair of wider trucks and bigger wheels to make it more like a longboard. This will be a little harder to ride than a longboard and its going to flex more so it wont have as good control but if you have experience skating then this is a decent option. Lastly we have the electric longboards. I personally dont ride any but I have before so I know how they behave. An electric longboard will make your life easier and you can certainly get around faster however you need to have experience riding before you go this route. I would strongly recommend against getting an electric longboard as your first board. Get a cheap longboard and ride that around for a while before diving in. Not only are they expensive but they also require more brain power and more understanding of how board control works to ride. If, however, you are looking to upgrade or have been riding a while then an electric longboard is a great option. The only reason I dont use one is that I use longboarding as a form of exercise since time is at a premium for me. 

*The Deck*

There are a lot of different types of decks out there, both with the wood they are made of and the style and shape of the board. Deck material is going to determine what kind of flex you have; a flexier deck is less controlable but more comfortable since it dampens some vibrations and bumps. You can find some good guides on the specifics of decks (as well as all of the other parts) which will teach you more about the different options, I'm just trying to give some guides on what is good and what isn't for campus riding. 

The deck style is something you will have lots of choices for. I don't know how much difference there is with different types more than just preference. In general a wider board will be more controlable and more comfortable but will be heavier for carrying to class. Longer decks are much the same in that respect. The longer it is (wheelbase, not deck size) the easier it will ride over bumps and cracks. Keep in mind that wheelbase is what matters, any board that hangs past the trucks on either end is just wasted weight. With that said you also can consider a kicktail. Some boards have a kicktail on one end that you can use to help get over bumps. I used to ride a kicktail and it was helpful but I prefer a longer wheelbase for what I do, its mostly just preference. If you plan to ride off campus or long distances then I would recommend a longer wheelbase over a kicktail since kicktail decks often have shorter wheelbases which are less comfortable when riding distance. Beyond that there isn't much difference between styles other than deck height. No matter what deck you get, make sure it is a good quality deck. You're going to be taking a lot of hits with it and if it is a cheap deck it WILL crack. 

TLDR: Longer wheelbase = more comfortable but less manouverable. Kicktails are a good substitute for wheelbase but only if you ride short distances. If you have big feet get a wide deck. 

*Wheels*

The bigger the better. In general a large wheel will ride over more stuff, its pretty simple actually. In addition to that, softer wheels are also better for riding over stuff. The drawback of big soft wheels however is weight and speed. Soft wheels will have more rolling friction and thus require a little more effort to keep your speed. You also have to consider wheel bite. If you have a deck that overhangs the wheels YOU MUST FACTOR IN WHEEL BITE. Wheel bite is when the wheel hits the bottom of the deck, this can be a big issue. If you have overhangs over the wheel you need to limit the size of your wheel based on how much you can lean before you get bit. With open wheel decks this isn't an issue. For this reason you will see a lot of people going with open wheel decks when riding on campus. As with the deck, you want good wheels. After a few hundred miles you are going to run into issues with wheels cracking and breaking if you got cheap wheels. 

*Trucks*

Make sure they are wide enough for your board. Make sure you put them on the right way (longboards are usually reverse kingpin). There are suspension trucks and double kingpin trucks however I have no experience with them, maybe people in the comments can give more on how they work. You can also get shock pads which lie between the deck and trucks and will help dampen vibrations. These are pretty cheap and will help make the ride a little smoother. 

*Bearings*

The best bearings are clean bearings. If you want a good cheap bearing get Bones Reds. I ride them exclusively and have gone through probably 5 sets of them. They are $10 a set on ebay and roll great. You can get more expensive bearings (like ceramics) which will last longer but in the end it isn't a huge difference in actual performance, its mostly maintenance. The most important thing is keeping your bearings clean. Every week you should give your wheels a quick spin and if you notice any that dont spin long, squeak, whine, etc. then you should clean it. Buy some bones speed cream and whenever you have a bum bearing just pop it out, rinse it out well with water or acetone to clean out the old lube and gunk, DRY IT WELL, and then put in a drop or two of speed cream. I do this once weekly and it helps keep your bearings spinning well and lets you coast with less effort. 

*Board Maintenance*

This is important. I already talked about weekly bearing maintenance in the section above, but what about the rest. Decks should be checked regularly for cracks. You will get small cracks in one or two layers of the board, you want to look for large cracks that penetrate multiple layers of the deck, these are going to be a risk for a snap. Check around where the bolts meet the deck as this is a high stress area. Wheels should also be checked when you check the deck. Look for cracks or missing chunks in the wheel that could cause it to break apart while riding. You will want to do a full rebuild 1 or 2 times a year (I do mine once a semester). Take the whole thing apart and clean it all up. This is a good time to check the things you wont normally look at like the bolts, bushings, and kingpin. I've had bolt heads shear off and if I didn't check my board I wouldn't have noticed. You can also take this time to clean out everything, wax your pivot cups, rotate your wheels (just like on your car this will help even out wear), and clean your griptape. If you invest in good stuff to begin with your maintenance should be easy. Over the 1000 miles I've ridden on my board the only thing I've had break is one bolt (aside from regular replacement of old bearings). 

**Riding to Class**

Riding to class is probably the main reason you want to start boarding on campus. Getting to class is going to me noticably faster with a longboard however you need to know how fast. Before class starts just do a quick ride around campus. Keep track of how long it takes to get from A to B so you know how much time you need to get to class. When riding to class it is usually best to stick to the roads; partially because the sidewalks suck, but also because of traffic. I'll discuss traffic more in the next section. When riding on the road you should consider yourself a biker. With this I mean that you follow all the rules of the road a bicyclist follows. Stay on the right side, stop at stop signs, leave stopping distance, give right of way, etc. The one difference between you and a bike is that you have no brakes so you need to take this into account when riding downhill. If you don't know how to foot brake then you NEED to learn, this is crucial for riding around other people. In addition to foot braking, know how to bail without loosing control of the board. By this I mean that you should be able to jump off your board and keep your board within your reach so it doesn't shoot into traffic. Board control is key for riding on campus, I'll go more into detail on board control in the next paragraph. 

When riding on campus you need to always keep your eyes open. Watch for bikers, traffic, and most importantly, distracted pedestrians. People like to walk out into the middle of the road a lot, I'm not sure why, but it happens. People often listen to music and are distracted when walking and you will need to have an eye open for them all the time. With this said, dont use your phone while riding and dont listen to music. When I say don't here, I'm not saying you never can. If it is late at night with nobody around then you can get away with listening to music but you still need to keep one ear open so avoid over the ear headphones. You are responsible for your surroundings when riding and you need to be vigilant. In addition to being aware of surroundings you need to be able to control your board. As I mentioned above, you need to know how to foot brake and how to bail. In addition to this you should know how to swerve around an obstacle and how to generally ride a board. It is helpful but not necessary to know things like dropping off curbs. I use this pretty frequently when there isn't much traffic and I need to get into the bike lane from the sidewalk. It should go without saying that you should be comfortable doing this in a parking lot before doing it in the road and you NEED to check for traffic before entering the road. In general if you are a new rider you should spend some time in the parking lot learning the ropes before you go out on campus. 

When you get to class you might be confused with what to do with your board. Obliviously you dont lock it on a bike rack, but where do you put it? Most of the time you can just leave it leaning against the wall by the door. Nobody is going to steal it, nobody is going to touch it, its just like a parking lot and its the best place to put it. If your wheels are still spinning (if they are then good job, you clearly keep care of your bearings) then give them a quick tap so you dont get the wall all dirty. If there are big tables you are sitting at then you can just throw it under the table, just be mindful of your neighbors. Don't bring your board to your seat in a lecture hall, it isn't necessary and just takes up space from the people around you. The beauty of longboarding is that you can just pick it up and bring it to class with you, dont be afraid of what people will think of you or where you will put it and not ride to class. 

**Dealing with Traffic**

If you're riding to class you will encounter lots of other people riding bikes and longboarding in the road so knowing how to deal with this is important. Firstly, if you have never ridden before then this is not the time to start. Practice on weekends or in the parking lots at night where you have lots of space. You will fall off your board or loose control at some point when you first start riding, better to happen where nobody else is around than in the middle of a busy road. With that out of the way I will assume you know how to ride. You should follow all of the same traffic rules as bicyclists do. Ride in the bike lane on the right side of the road, give pedestrians at cross walks the right of way, stop at stop signs, stay to the right unless passing, etc. You should be able to ride a constant 10-15 mph on flat ground and keep up reasonably with bikes. Always make sure to keep stopping distance between the people around you and make sure you know what is going on. You want to do a quick glance over your shoulder every once in a while to check who is behind you. 

There are some locations on campus that are going to be extra tricky to ride in. The first thing I think of is the green roundabout by Wisenbaker/ETB area. With this you are expected to stay in the green bike lane. You must yield to pedestrians and most importantly, yield to vehicles in the intersection. The biggest risk here is crossing the street when a car is making the turn in the intersection as it is difficult for them to see you. Another spot you might run into issues is the tunnel going under wellborn near Kyle Field. If you have never gone down a fast hill before, do not attempt this. On good bearings you will get up to 25+ mph and the surface has lots of cracks and seams in it. It is a good idea to practice by riding in the parking garages before you attempt this when lots of people are around. Before going down it you should also know what your downhill stance is. If you keep the regular perpendicular stance you will likely get speed wobbles and you aren't gonna be having a good time. When going through, make sure you stay in the bike lane and stay to the right. Always pass to the left and always keep an eye open for pedestrians who might move in front of you. This is probably the most dangerous place you'll find yourself as you will be going quite fast and wont have many options to bail. I'd only recommend experienced riders go through this during busy hours. In addition to that I would urge you to avoid walkways as much as possible when classes are switching. The stone walkways near the MSC and Evans are going to be very busy, it is not worth it to try and navigate that on a board. Additionally if you ever get into a situation where there is a lot of congestion and you dont see a clear line, just pop up your board and walk through it. 

**Riding Off Campus**

Pretty much everything I've talked about so far has been about riding on campus, but it is perfectly doable to commute from off campus. I live 1 mile off campus and 3 miles from most of my classes and regularly commute via longboard. Riding off campus is a little bit trickier as there are fewer bike lanes, more vehicles, and worse sidewalks. I would suggest you get comfortable riding on campus before deciding to take it off the beaten path. The first point I'll make is to not ride to class. You're probably gonna get all sweaty when it is hot out and for the sake of your fellow classmates its best if you just take the bus. Riding home on the other hand is a really good option. I almost always ride home because the busses are slow. I often see my bus at the bus stop and then track it as I ride to my apartment and the only time I dont beat the bus is at night when there is no traffic and it skips half the stops. This will probably vary by route but in general the busses are hot, sweaty, noisy, and slow. Longboarding is a pretty decent alternative that keeps you active and you get to enjoy a smooth ride home. 

As I said, riding off campus can be tricky. I've found there isn't a good general set of rules for where to ride. If there is an empty sidewalk I will take that to stay out of the street even if there are bike lanes, especially if it is a heavily trafficked road. On the other hand if there are no sidewalks or they are in a bad condition you can ride in the road assuming there are bike lanes. If there aren't bike lanes but it is a local road that has little traffic then you can also ride in the street, just be mindful of other drivers. You also need to realize that there will probably be a lot more crap in the bike lanes as stuff usually gets pushed to the side. There is a lot of traffic in cstat which means lots of construction vehicles and hence lots of debris. Be mindful and always be looking at what is ahead. As usual you also need to obey traffic laws. 

If you choose not to ride then you aren't left out in the cold, you can always take your board on the bus. When you ride the bus with your board just make sure you hold it vertical so it doesn't take up extra space. Dont put it on the seat next to you and dont throw it on the floor. When the busses are really packed and you need to remove your backpack just make sure to keep your board close to you. 

.

Longboarding is a great way to get around and can be a lot of fun. Some of my best moments in aggieland are of riding though the parking lot of kyle field after a hard exam. It is a really good way to let off steam and is a good way to get exercise with a busy schedule. If you ever see me riding around campus feel free to say hi, I'm the guy with maroon shoes, maroon wheels and usually a beanie. Hopefully this has been helpful, feel free to ask any questions.

Best place for an off-campus student to take a private nap on campus?,11,33,"Howdy Ags!

As someone who lives off-campus, and occasionally doesn't get enough sleep, I was wondering if there are some nice places to take a private nap on campus. I see students taking naps on library couches, outside on the grass, or even on the cement benches (really?), but I carry a lot of stuff and would feel more at ease sleeping where nobody can see me or take my stuff.

My usual strategy is to either ask a friend if I can sleep in their dorm or to go to Evans, get an individual room, put the chairs on the desk, and sleep on the floor with my backpack as my pillow. I'm actually fine with this method, but it can get uncomfortable and COLD. I'm just wondering if there's a better solution, if one exists. That's all.

And please, I don't need any smart-ass answers such as ""Well maybe you should get some more sleep the night before."" Well no shit, genius. But life doesn't always turn out that way so it's nice to have a small plan-B to catch up on sleep between classes.

Biggest Regrets and Successes of My College Career (Advice),177,27,"What's up my dudes. I graduated last spring and wanted to share some of my experiences with y'all, especially the younger classmen. I did some things right and some things I wouldn't definitely change if I could go back, but I have no regrets. Everything we do in life shapes who we are.

&#x200B;

**A Few Things I Did Right:**

\-Finding balance between school and life

In my opinion this is one of the biggest things that people struggle with. I can definitely empathize if you need to make the grade to get into med school or a competitive internship, etc. The reality is though that once you graduate and land your first gig, your gpa doesn't matter at all.

I've met so many people who base their self worth off of their grades, tests scores, gpa and it's incredibly unhealthy.

School and grades definitely matter, but make time for other stuff and realize that college is supposed to be fun and not, too, stressful.

Go out, have fun, get involved, but get your shit done. If its above a 3.0 thats good enough in my book.

&#x200B;

\-Having some interest outside of school

Having something to focus on and improve upon outside of your school/social life is a great way to become a more interesting person and a great distraction for when you're stressed out or just need a distraction.

This could be playing guitar, tinkering with electronics, cooking, lifting. For me it was climbing. Try and pick something you can improve upon/see progress in and is something you are genuinely interested in.

It's also a great way to meet people and expand your social circle. Plus you have something to say when those awkward icebreaker questions come up.

&#x200B;

\-Taking classes just because you are interested in them

If you're schedule allows, I think one of the best things you can do is take random classes just because they seem interesting. Some of the most interesting classes I've taken have fit into this category (shoutout Big Bang, Blackholes, No Math, the wine classes offered in the HORT department, and whitewater canoeing). Most degrees get at lest a few electives, take advantage of them.

Follow your passions and interests, you might be surprised.

&#x200B;

\-Getting an en-camps job

If you're working while going to school, getting an on-campus job is 100% the move. I'm sure it varies by position, but most jobs are very flexible and will work with your schedule.

Most en-camps jobs are way better than what you'll find off campus (hot tip: the Health Science Center pays $12/hr).

&#x200B;

**A Few Things I Did Not So Right:**\-Not getting involved soon enough

I transferred to A&M from Blinn my sophomore year and didn't get involved until Spring of my Junior year. I was cool with just partying with my friends I already had and didn't really try to get involved until I only had a year and a half of school left.

It was pretty upsetting, because as I graduated I felt like I was just starting to find my stride.

My hot tip is to make sure you really look at all the options. There are more ways to get involved at A&M than Fish Camp and FLOs and SLOs. There's a ton of club sports (most don't require any type of experience), small organizations (shoutout CASTLE), and countless ways to get involved.

I got rejected by a SLO after transferring in and thought that was it for getting involved. There are so many orgs that there's no reason not to join something. It really makes your college experience so much better.

&#x200B;

\-Taking my time in College Station for granted

If you've ever heard the Trace Adkins song 'You're Gonna Miss This', that's pretty much how I feel.

I'm a self admitted 2%er and couldn't wait to leave CSTAT. After leaving though, I realize how much of a special place Aggieland is and how a piece of me will always be in the little town on the Brazos. It really is a special place and even if you're not a diehard reads, try and enjoy as much of it as you can.

Get involved, participate in the traditions, go to the football games, and make the most of your time in college, you only get one shot (for most of us at least).

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear what some of y'alls biggest successes and regrets have been as well!

Consider establishing yourself as a patient now (especially if you plan to be in the Atlanta area after you graduate or still have plenty of time left at Tech) so that when you do get the flu, strep, or something is wrong with your undercarriage, you can see a doctor that day.  Most of these practices can easily refer you to mental health providers as well.

Every day that I leave school, I am worried I will be the next victim. @GTPD what are you doing to protect the safety of students off-campus? This is insane that each week we get the same email, yet nothing is being done. 

Who can I speak to regarding this matter at school? Stingerette offers a free ride service where they drop you off in front of your house, but this is only for after 11pm. Well, today I received an email that FOUR students were assaulted at 8:40pm, which is the time I arrived home today from Clough. Who can we talk to so that Transportation Services moves this 11pm time to maybe 9pm or so?

ATTENTION LIBRARY FANS: DVD collection being moved permanently off campus. Please contact library if you disagree with this action.,52,16,"The awesome DVD collection on the second floor of Gilbert Library is going to be permanently moved off campus in the libraries effort to go digital.

I believe this will negatively effect students. The DVD collection is of medium/large size and contains a QUALITY collection of TV shows (like Game of Thrones), important classic and modern films, as well as new releases.

The collection is very compact and does not take up very much space at all. It is nice to be able to browse movies in person, be spontaneous, look at cover art, and not have to wait until the next day to watch a movie you decide on.

It is also nice because most of the collection are not going to be found on Netflix. Making their access difficult will likely lead students to pirate the movie online rather than wait a day for the copy from the library storage.

If you are interested in keeping the DVD collection on campus please email or call a library administrator found here: [http://www.library.gatech.edu/about/index.php](http://www.library.gatech.edu/about/index.php)

Thanks

**EDIT 6/25**

It looks like the decision the remove the DVDs is pretty final.

The good news is that the **Sci-Fi Book collection** will be kept and is going to the Towers and the **Core Collection of books** will return to Gilbert once it has been remodeled.

On-campus vs off-campus (Exchange student),11,12,"**Hi there!**

My name is Thomas and I'm from Denmark.

I'm going on exchange at GaTech for Fall'14 and Spring'15 semester and seeing that the deadline for guaranteed on-campus housing is (too) soon, I would like to make up my mind on whether I'm going to go for an accommodation on-campus or off-campus.

I've therefore tried to make an overview of pros and cons. 
*(Note, that I purposely didn't apply for I-house as I wanted to be more embedded and close with you ""natives""):*



**On-campus:**

*Pros:* 

- Closer to everything (I might only need a bike?)

- More intimate and embedded with my fellow students

*Cons:*

- Limited living space

- Long-termed payment/commitment to the accommodation

- No free choice of room mates


**Off-campus:**

*Pros:*

- Free choice of room mates

- Free choice of location and place

- Most likely more space

*Cons:*

- Free choice will probably make me pick someone ""safe""

- Further from campus (I will need a car)

- Distanced/Isolated from the locals / my class mates etc. (I know I'll be very good at not inviting people despite being a very social person)


Can you tell me if I'm all off on these pros and cons, add a few points or in any way help me tip the scales?

Tips on how to stay safe off campus this summer?,20,29,"I’m living alone in a house this summer (All three of my roommates are gone till August RIP me) and I’ve been feeling incredibly uneasy at home alone. To make it worse, I live off campus way east of high. I’m really cautious about locking all my windows, locking all my doors even if I’m just stepping out to throw out the garbage for just a minute, and double checking all the locks at night. I have a second floor bedroom, so I always make sure to deadbolt my bedroom door before bed as well. 

However, for the last few days in particular, I’ve been getting the feeling that someone has been in my house. Doors will be open that I left closed, and sometimes I SWEAR that I can hear someone walking around my house. We have a basement (where the laundry room is located as well as an empty room no one lives in)  and an attic (my third roommate used to live in there) but I never go to these floors except maybe once every two weeks to do laundry so there’s a lot of space in this house to roam about. 

Today I came home and the toilet seat was left up on our first floor bathroom and it 100% wasn’t me (I’m a girl). The door leading to my basement was also left half open even though I closed it shut two days ago. It’s a really tough door to open/ close so the only way to open it is if you apply body force. Then I thought I heard someone upstairs in the attic. Our walls are very thin so I can always hear if my roommate is shuffling around in her room in the attic right above me. They sounded like actual footsteps and then It sounded like her door opened. I texted her asking if she was home and she said she wasn’t- well fuck. i called my mom right away and bolted the fuck out of my house and straight to a friend’s where I am writing this from. 

Maybe it’s all in my head but are there any things I could buy that would secure my house even more? Things to keep the doors closed or small alarms that you have used that worked? There’s a lot of stuff online but I’m just really freaked out and don’t know what would be effective to protect me and and actually work/ be not too expensive. Any help would be much appreciated by my anxious ass. 

Additional Info: I was recently informed by old tenants that the code to our back door/ lock hasn’t been changed by our landlord in over 2.5 years (ie the old resident had the same code as their old tenants) so technically anyone could really let themselves in if they wanted. 

UPDATE: Stayed the night at a friend's place. Came back this morning to shower. Saw the temperature on the thermostat had been set/ increased to 77 degrees because the house was feeling really hot. I never ever set it above 60 degrees because I like a cold house. Someone changed it and I'm even more terrified now",brxmfc,osu

"Housing Available ($315/month rent, 10 min. walk to 18th Ave Library, North side of off campus)",12,11,"Hello everyone,

I have a room available in my 4 person house for next school year.

Here are the **benefits** of living with us:

- **Affordable** rent: **Our rent is $315/month**. People are often shocked when I tell them how much my rent is (it's actually $300/month this year, but our landlords are raising it, $315 is still of course cheap as heck)

- **Very** close to campus: This house is about a 7 minute walk to the North Rec and a 10 minute walk to 18th avenue library (I know this because I work at 18th ave, and I often leave 10 minutes before I have to be at work)

- North side of off campus: In my opinion, the north side of off campus is better to live on. If you look at the crime reports that have happened this school year, the overwhelming majority happened on the south side. I have a big appetite, and I often walk to get food as late as 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. I have never felt unsafe walking home at night because most of the high street drama tends to not make it to the north side. 

- We are also a 3 minute walk to the CVS on North High, the new Starbucks, the new Chipotle, and the Amazon Pickup Center. Believe me, this location is A1.

For anyone looking to live off-campus...,27,6,"(...especially Harrison Apartments.)

My roommate and I recently got our security deposit check from Harrison after living there for two years. It was for $1,000 out of the $1,425 we put down. Didn't really give it much thought at first because I honestly wasn't expecting to even get that much back after hearing all the horror stories from others who moved out before we did.

As I was looking over the checklist of deductions, I realized that not only did they completely exaggerate or blatantly lie about things being dirty or damaged, they charged us for normal wear and tear that was stated as allowable in our lease. On top of that, THEY LISTED THE WRONG TOTAL DEPOSIT AMOUNT. We were stiffed $200 simply by their inability to write the correct amount of our security deposit. Whether this was intentional to pocket more money or an honest mistake, it's definitely unacceptable.

Please don't be passive when it comes to security deposits or other matters concerning a rental. Read your leases thoroughly and review every single line regarding your security deposit inspection. These landlords off-campus are NOT in the business to look out for their tenants and they know college students are much less inclined to fight for their financial interests than older adults.",9fbl59,osu

An Increase in Off-Campus Burglaries,25,6,"[Columbus PD Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qzQdDcN9Mw)

I just wanted to highlight an important part of taking pictures of your serial numbers. When I was in the army we had High Value Item Sheets where anything over $50, we took pictures of the item, and then wrote down their serial number and wrote them down on this piece of papers and had one in our room and one at the company. Now I’m not recommending writing them down because I find it somewhat unnecessary with technology today. However, taking photos of the serial numbers is important. I still do it today for insurance claims more than anything over $50. When you call the police about stolen items, giving the item information and serial number allows the police department to send the info off to nearby pawn shops and report stolen info. Though, that isn’t super likely to get it returned, my wife has had her car busted twice, and stolen once when we lived in Colorado Springs and didn’t get anything back except a totaled Jeep. It is very helpful for making claims through your renters insurance for stolen items and getting some sort of reimbursement. It may not even hurt to take insurance out on very expensive or important items. So I highly recommend taking pictures as a minimum, and make sure to lock your doors, for your home and car, and keep your windows closed. ",9flanp,osu

Gap Year Freshman Housing Issue. (On-Campus or Off-Campus?),1,5,"So here’s the story. I am a freshman who graduated from high school in 2016. Since OSU first told me students should live on campus for first two years. I thought I will live on campus for my sophomore year. 

Yesterday, I realized almost all of my freshmen friends received their lottery numbers and information about their housing. I checked my email, but there was absolutely no information regarding housing.

So I emailed housing today and received this email.
		
“You are a GAP year student so if you want to live on campus we can add you to the lottery, do you have a roommate group you were trying to be part of?”

I am both confused and angry since I received no notification about this topic. But more importantly, what should I do now?

I think I’m guaranteed to have crappy dorm if I’m added to the lottery now. I don’t mind living off-campus, but isn’t it too late to look for off-campus housing?

Unfortunately, I right knee is broken right now. I can walk but not for long. So off-campus housing that is far from me would be bad for me. (W.Lane Ave to Ohio Union is the distance I can travel easily.) I hope I can use this to my advantage, but I’m not “classified” as disabled by OSU.

If not, then I would like to hear your guys experience with deaf roommates (If you ever had one). I can't really speak at all and can only communicate using sign-language. This is why I'm starting to get a little bit freaked about becoming roommates with people I can't communicate with at all.

Off Campus Restaurants For You to Try,59,79,"Hey Everyone,

WARNING: You will need friends with a car or a car to try these places, a lot of them are not close to campus

I'm a giant foodie and I love Rochester food so I thought it would be helpful to list some places that you guys can try in and around Rochester! Especially since there hasn't been many threads to discuss this and lay out various places in and around downtown (I do not have a comprehensive list, this is just going to be from my experience). 

**BBQ:**

Sticky Lips: I prefer Sticky lips, especially the one close to RIT for it's larger bar and less of a tourist nest and wait. Also the bar has a super nice selection.

Dinosaur BBQ: Typical thing, you have to try it at least once I feel. 

**Chinese:**

Yummy Garden - There is a hotpot section (chinese fondue but normal soup ingredients) and they have bubble tea. They do delivery, and that includes delivery of bubble tea onto campus. 

Han's Noodle Bar is your cut above delivery Chinese

**Coffee:**

Joe Bean Coffee Roasters - They have a brunch every weekend from 11-3PM with one vegan option for those who would like it. Super nice staff who roast their own beans. Beer and wine are also served and hand picked by one of the senior staff. Careful about coming here though too often, this place left me a HUGE coffee snob. (I'm still ordering beans from them and I moved to Texas.)

Fuego - Also a great place to go and they also roast their own beans.

**Ethiopian:**

Abyssinia - You eat everything with your hands and this spongey sour dough bread. It's absolutely something you should try at least once in your life, especially if you're into trying new things.

**Garbage Plates:**
Topic of controversy, just like BBQ:

Dogtown is my favorite place but almost every place in Rochester has their own personal touch to this dish. (They're called Junkyard plates here)

**German:**

Rorhbach's - If you love beer, especially german beer, this is the place for you. Scotch Ale and a to DIE for cider. They also switch out seasonal drinks and they make most of their beers themselves. 

**Greek/Brunch:**

Jines - Holy shit, this place has like an hour wait on the weekends, go during the week or go super early, it's always populated. I love their spanakopita though

**Indian:**

Tandoor - They have a more americanized Lunch Buffet every Tuesday that is well worth it

**Korean:**

Seoul House - It has the Korean BBQ section where you can grill your own delicious meat

Sodam - cheaper but you can't make your own meat and it has a smaller menu, still very delicious though. It's also a bit harder to find

**Pizza:**

Napa - If you don't want some normal delivery pizza, the best you can get is here. Sangria is also super fine though be prepared to spend some money.

**Ramen:**

Furoshiki - Best appetizer is Pork Buns

Han Noodle Bar - They're a bit cheaper than Furoshiki and they also have delicious chicken and pork buns, but they come with peanuts so sorry for those who have peanut allergies.

**Sushi:**

Tokyo Restaurant - **Closed** :(

Osaka Sushi - This is the best bang for your buck because they have an all you can eat option for your sushi. Lunch is obviously cheaper but you can stuff yourself with all the sushi you want. 

**Vegan/Allergy Safe places:**

Joe Bean - There is always a vegan tray with hummus on the menu, pumpkin seeds and vegan friendly cookies from local bakeries (still delicious). They avoid nuts for those with nut sensitive allergies.

Owl House - This place also has the best steak you can get, but it's also expensive ($30 for a steak). The best thing to get is the buffalo Cauliflower, god I miss it. 

Red Fern - Also a place where you will spend money, but they have a nut free and soy free menu at all times

"SG Update 2/28/2016: Amway and Vector are Scams, and we’re kicking them off campus",119,42,"Hello RIT Students and Community,

 

Recently [a reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/46wy5f/got_locked_in_a_room_during_interview_need/) brought up a disconcerting encounter with a multi-level marketing (MLM) company such as Vector Marketing, Vemma or Amway (AKA: a pyramid scheme). These companies come on campus with representatives pretending to be RIT alumni or students and use unreserved rooms to try and pitch some type of “business opportunity” for our students, when in reality they are just trying to use you are a quick money-grab or rope you into trying to get your friends into their pyramid scheme.

These companies will push hard, tell lies, use unethical tactics and even stop you from leaving the room to push their snake oil products, and RIT Student Government has teamed up with Academic Affairs and RIT Public Safety to say enough is enough. This past Friday our SG Senate [unanimously passed a resolution](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_clKUpvC1qDOE9ldzNKZ2FtVDg) in support of banning these companies from campus, and the MLM company representatives in the events described in the reddit thread have been given Cease-and-Desist orders from RIT Legal Affairs. 

If you see posters for these pyramid scheme companies around campus, tear them down. If you are invited to some business opportunity on campus and you suspect they are affiliated with these companies, tell them to be upfront about their company name and credentials and alert Public Safety with their info if they are trying to get you to buy into their scam. If anyone has information on people affiliated with these MLM-companies or encounters you’ve had on campus, please email me at sgpres@rit.edu with the details and we'll make sure they are banned from campus.

If you are already involved in one of these companies and don’t know how to get out, please set up a meeting for our free legal consultation in the SG office in the Campus Center or email me and I will try and connect you to the right people on campus.

 Best of luck at the RIT Spring Career Fair, make sure to get your resumes ready for some real business opportunities this Wednesday!

 

Regards,

/u/itsnickk, RIT Student Government President

So here's my problem. I have Time Warner's road runner fiber optic package (whatever they refer to it as) and have noticed that the internet for certain applications is astonishingly bad compared to previous places I have lived. In particular I notice it on youtube and am trying to narrow down if it is Time Warner or some other problem. Do any of you have serious problems with youtube buffering and loading particularly in 720p or higher even though your internet is exceptionally capable of handling the load?

I thought for a while it was my computer having problems but when I routed the youtube connection through a proxy server I was able to have all the 720 and 1080p videos load nearly instantly even though it was connecting through Texas on the proxy.

If any of you have had similar problems I would greatly appreciate passing along what you know. If it is just isolated to me then I will be able to further identify where the problem is.

2) Extra funds in RIT accounts may be refunded once a direct deposit is set up after some amount of time discussed on the financial services page. From personal experience (if any of you have done this before), around when did you receive these funds?

Off-Campus-Living Dread :(,6,13,"Warning, rant ahead:

Watched one of my friends move in to res today and immediately get welcomed with all these activities and opportunities to meet people/bond with a community. 

I cannot live on res due to obligations at home, but the vast majority of my friends are living in res.

I'm dreading not being able to make any new friends because everyone living on res will have such a huge head start, and none of my friends are talking to me anymore due to them spending time on res activities (tried to message a few friends when I started feeling down, but none responded since I figured they're busy with res orientation?). This feeling is probably compounded by general nervousness surrounding first year, but at this point I really don't see how a socially anxious (yep, the properly diagnosed kind of social anxiety) introvert with no knack for conversation is going to not end up being lonely for the rest of the year.

Unpopular Opinion: The College System,6,15,"I’ve been thinking recently about how the college system is one of their main ways establishing communities among students at UofT, since the school is so large. 

However, that got me thinking, do issuing students into a college deflect the community that can exist at other schools? For example, my friend at Western University feels able/free to go to any residence, dining hall, and student building without thinking. On the other hand, at UofT, I have noticed many (myself included) students who are/make themselves restricted to their college in terms of friends, food, and places to study/relax at. Even subconsciously, I feel like I *have* to resort to my own specific college to hang out after class, even though I theoretically could go wherever (I don’t live on campus for reference).

For example, as a member of Trinity College, I feel as if I not welcomed to go to the Goldring Student Centre at Vic because I “don’t belong there.” (I bet you reading the fact I go to Trinity might have put a thought in your brain that I could be an “elitist, salty and a dickhead” person even though I try to never replicate those characteristics in my actual life.)

I in fact really appreciate Victoria College, and think their facilities/approach to many things are better than my own college - even UC, New, St. Mikes, WW and (of course) Innis do certain things right BUT because I am not part of them, I feel as if I can never, or will ever, be able to use these “school-wide” facilities.

I am not saying colleges are a bad idea, I am just wishing students should be taught about ALL the different places around campus among every colleges and school building and be given more access as both an on-res, near-res and off campus student.",dwya2m,UofT
it was never about bahen,286,24,"not that the people saying we need to take steps to make bahen safer are \*wrong\*, but realistically, suicide proofing campus isn't going to solve any of the problems we're facing here and isn't the best use of anyone's time/effort.

when the doctors at hwc tell actively suicidal people that they probably won't be able to get therapy through the school and tell us to find help on our own? that's the problem.

when the wait times to get an intake on the first floor are in the months? that's the problem.

when year after year students find themselves with less coverage for therapy and medications? that's the fucking problem. 

hell, the fact that the only response that's seemed to come out of any of these suicides is sending people a bunch of hotlines just shows how little uoft seems to care. honestly if they're going to do the bare minimum, making it easier to commit suicide off campus than on is just letting uoft off the hook. at least when the suicide is on campus the university is forced to see what we're living through thanks to their inaction. 

if we have to sit around for months hoping that eventually there will be room in treatment we need/can actually afford, then the admin should see the blood on their hands. don't allow the university to ignore the problem by hiding it off campus, make sure they know \*exactly\* what the consequences of their inaction are

this was never about bahen, this is about three people who killed themselves literally steps away from the help system the university has allowed to be so ineffective. if we're going to point fingers, they need to be pointing in the right direction.",daa712,UofT

UofT vs. McGill,12,26,"Hello everyone! I know this question gets asked a lot in here and at Mcgill's, but hear me out. I got accepted into UofT for an art major and I also got accepted into McGill but for a major that I ended up not being really in love with, so I have to make a decision between the two.

In my opinion, both seem like pretty good schools but there are certain factors that are making me reconsider my decisions, so I am gonna put them in below:

&#x200B;

**McGill University**

Pros

1. **Everything is more affordable**
   1. Tuition in McGill, in my case, is three times cheaper than in UofT for the same major
      1. If the education is pretty much the same or better at McGill, then I consider that price a bargain in comparison to UofT. You are basically paying for the same or better prestige, education, and school for a bit less than 1/4 of UofT price.
      2. The highest price you can get for tuition at McGill is around $45k.
   2. Residence is way cheaper and more spacious than at UofT. I did not apply for residence, but I found out that the dorms more spacious and 4k - 10k lower than UofT. This makes UofT residences seem like a joke. If I could go back again, I would have checked the box for interest in housing option.
   3. Housing off-campus is also very cheap. I read someone say that they paid $700/month for a place in Montreal.
2. McGill is very known for being **culturally diverse** and having a very heterogenous international population, which to me seems a really good opportunity to meet people from around the world.
3. Montreal is considered to be a **laid-back, artsy, and European style city.** It is not as fast-paced as the city of Toronto, so I think I will feel less pressure living there.
4. **Admission is more selective**, therefore the alumni must be consisting of academically successful individuals who are intellectual and ambitious at the same time.
5. Montreal is well known for the **social scene and night life** (though not important to me).

Cons

1. McGill is placed at a **lower position than UofT in terms of prestige** (based of top lists). It is the top 2nd in Canada and top 33rd in the world.
2. It is apparently more difficult to find a job if you do not **speak French**.
3. I chose a major that I ended up not liking at McGill. I see that I have the option of transferring from one faculty to the other, but the problem is that I have to **wait until the end of my first year to actually apply for transfer**. I am afraid that I am going to waste a year studying something I do not enjoy and may repeat my first year on my second year due to lack of credits. If I am wrong with this information, please correct me.
4. A lot of **people smoking everywhere**. I am not a fan of it.
5. Some people claim that Montreal can be racist or discriminating, especially to non-French speakers or non-caucasians.
6. Less options. There might be less options for study (I think by that people mean elective courses or learning opportunities) due to lower fundings compared to UofT.

**University of Toronto**

Pros

1. **University of Toronto is placed at the top in terms of prestige**. It is 1st in Canada and 28th in the world. Going there leaves a good impression on people.
2. The city of Toronto is considered to be very **modern and industrious**. Also, it is also called a great city outside of Canada. There are many things to do and many places to go to.
3. **People who are only anglophone are more likely to find jobs in here than in Montreal**.
4. Most big, industrious companies are based here. If I am looking for a a very nice position or a good job during school or after graduation, I seems that I can find it very easily in here.

Cons

1. **Everything is too expensive**
   1. I am expected to pay almost $60k on my first year for tuition alone. Hypothetically speaking, if that was the cost for every year for 4 years, then I would have to pay $240k for my whole college career.
   2. Residence is overpriced and way less spacious than in McGill (Trinity College Residence).
   3. I searched for off-campus housing, and the the lowest price you can get is between $800-$900. Apartments that are leased $700/month are very sketchy and too good to be true.
   4. Living expenses are higher than in Montreal.
2. It seems like University of Toronto is n**ot as culturally and internationally diverse as McGill**. Most international students come from Asia, or most of the non-caucasian Canadians are Asian-Canadians. Nothing against them (I am Asian myself), simply that I like to have friends and learn about the culture from more than a single group of people.
3. The city of Toronto can be quite **overwhelming and so more stressful** to live in due to the fast-paced environment.
4. It has been mentioned pretty much everywhere, so it is undeniable: i**t is easier to get into UofT than graduating from it**. I have seen that they accept people with marks as low as 85% and tend to give extremely challenging classes to students from 2nd year and up (a pretty good business strategy though).
5. From what I have seen in reddit, people seem **more stressed at UofT**. Some even regret going there to study. Some claim that they  work and study all day long, so people do not usually party in here. I don't care much about partying because I usually don't go to parties, but I want some free time for myself and my hobbies. Also, this can be the case for any school.

&#x200B;

I am an international student and the major I am interested in is offered by the faculty of arts(for both schools). The main factors in making my decision are **affordability, quality of education, and how my future can be affected by where I go for college**. In terms of price, McGill has greater advantage over UofT. In terms of quality of education, which one do you think teaches me more and better? Which one has a better arts faculty? Finally, which one is more recognised outside of Canada? Is there any preference for any school when applying to jobs in Canada?

I am also planning to apply for jobs starting my second year to pay my living expenses on my own. If I go to McGill, would there be any chance for me to find a job? I have work experience and I am multilingual, but I simply do not know French.

I am not planning on taking a masters, at least not right after graduation. I am considering going into law, but I am still deciding. For now, I want to land into a good job and explore as many options as possible after graduation.

Which school should I pick?",bkqsvn,UofT
Urgent-UTM International Frosh: Stressed About Residence,8,8,"I originally applied late to UTSG and received an alternate offer to UTM a few days back.  
However, housing deadlines had passed by then and I don't have a guarantee of residence on-campus.

Even now, I tried to accept the offer ASAP, but as it takes some time for the  offer to get updated in the OUAC portal, I'm stuck waiting. The MyRes portal doesn't work and pops the innocent error- ""Something went wrong! Please refresh the page or try again later.""

Most good(and not crazy expensive) off-campus residences are unavailable by this time. Transit times and costs, food considerations, resource management are an added mental burden that I'm not quite ready for yet.  
As an international student, on top of being a freshman, moving to a new country is quite an intimidating experience for me.  
I feel lost thinking about what I would do without on-campus housing and the social opportunities it affords.

  
I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can give me some advice and tell me who to contact in this regard. I'm trying to do my best for on-campus residence.",byn5lv,UofT

CHM135/136 vs 151?,0,2,"I have just arrived in Toronto and am going to be studying sciences starting in September. My course enrollment starts on Thursday. I was debating between taking chemistry 135/136 l, which are one term long, known as weeder courses for life Sciences vs chemistry 151, which is year long, more math and physics based and apparently more in depth and for those looking to major in chemistry. 151 also has course communities every week which introduces students to off campus chemistry opportunities. I heard that the GPA is the same for both, but that may be the self selecting factor for 151. There is a drop out rate for 151 of 75 percent in the first few weeks apparently. It’s a lot more work. I have attached pictures with course descriptions. Can you make any reccomendations for which one I should take? Thanks :)",cgmj9s,UofT

"How can we improve our platform that shows nearby recreational events/activities on campus for students to join (ex.

So a bunch of us are working on an Android App limited to Canadian university students (for now) that lets people create their own events such as Pickup ball/soccer games, Board Games, ect.... These events would then appear on the feed of the main app and users could filter these events by what they are interested in and then choose to attend these events. It's basically just a way for people to find events they are interested in easier. Any advice would be appreciated & there are a few questions in the google doc form that would help us a lot.

Party Life?,1,7,Hey! I'm thinking of applying next year and was wondering what the party life is like on campus? How about off campus?,babyps,UofT
Considering going to UofT - have a few questions,2,4,"So I have a few options as to where to go for my studies, and UofT is one of them. I'm Canadian but not a resident, so there were lots of admissions scholarships that I couldn't get because of that. I'm going to do a Physics Specialist program, probably going on to do at least a Master's after that.  
I was admitted to Innis College Residence and got a ~$3000 entrance scholarship from them. So I looked at how much a degree at UofT would cost, assuming that I'd spend one year in residence and three years out:

* $8380 tuition
* $9577.14 to live at Innis for 8 months
* $1000 per month for rent and utilities off-campus
* $50 per month for internet
* $280 per month for food
* $100 per month for textbooks and course supplies
* $60 per month for phone/mobile data
* $120 per month for health and personal care
* $150 per month for monthly entertainment and other expenses
* $1000 per year to travel to UofT and come back to my home country  

Which adds up to $99 077.14 over the course of 4 years. Are these estimates accurate?  
Besides this, I have a few other questions:  

* How feasible is it to work and study as a full-time student (maintaining a high GPA of course)
* If it is feasible, how much is it possible to earn that way?
* What are the chances of getting in-course scholarships?
* How difficult is it to get a well-paying PEY as a Physics student?
* What is the learning environment like, especially in Physics?
* How are the professors in general?
* How would you rate the quality of learning?
* If I don't like drinking/smoking/partying, what is the social life like?

Thanks a lot!",bfzee1,UofT

Questions about living off campus and tips?,4,10,"Hey hokies! This coming fall I'm gonna be living of campus for the first time. I'm real excited, but at the same time also very confused. There are some things that I am kinda worried about, so I'll just list my questions below. I don't know if it'll be possible for everyone to answer them, as I know different housing places have different rules, but it's worth a shot.

-When I move in, I want to first take care of getting a bed so I can sleep that night. Would you recommend bringing something like an air mattress? I don't think my parent's car will fit a real mattress, let along an entire bed frame as well. What should I do with the whole bed thing for my first night? I'm open to suggestions.

-How do people get big things like bed frames, desks/chairs, refrigerators, etc. into their places? I more than likely will not have room in my car to transport any of those things from a place someone is selling them to my house.

-What's the usual policy with people sleeping over? Say my parents wanted to spend the night in my house, would that be fine? I read in the handbook that people should not be staying in the house for so long that it's like they're living there, but it doesn't specify how long is too long. Is it usually ok for people to sleep over for just 1 night?

These are my main questions. If you can think of anything else, tips or otherwise, that would make moving in much easier for me, please let me know. Keep in mind that it's my first time ever living off campus, so really anything you have to say about that will be helpful for me. In case you were wondering, yes I'm living with people that I know, but I felt like I was bugging them too much with all the questions I was asking them.

How does off-campus housing work?,4,2,"Hello there! As a first-generation college student in my family, I am a little out of the loop of how things work.

So I am interested in living off-campus for the next school year. Let's say I receive a certain amount of financial aid and tuition is $7-$8k. The rest of the money that's leftover, will that get sent to my bank as a refund check and I can use that to pay rent? I'm mostly worried about the cost but if I get a decent refund check, that'll help me a lot. 

Also, on my FAFSA when it asks, ""will you be living on-campus or off-campus?"", I put on-campus just in case my off-campus housing plans fall through. Should I change this? Will this affect anything?

Looking at my schedule for fall semester, there's not really more than 3 hours of free time during my days, but evenings and my weekends are open. I know students work at these places, but I'm not sure if places allow for short shift flexibility (working 3-4hr shifts instead of the typical 6-8), and allow students to work \~10 hrs a week, or if they prefer students who have more open schedules and can work closer to 20hrs a week.

Looking for advice on moving from one off-campus house to another this summer.,0,2,"So I'm just now realizing how much a pain this is going to be, and I'm wondering if anyone has had to do something similar or has any advice. 

I'm moving into a new house for the next academic year, and I'm planning on bringing the furniture from my current house to that house. The houses aren't far from each other, so the process of moving itself isn't a huge deal. 

The problem is, my current lease runs out on August 16th, and my new lease doesn't start till August 30th. That means I would have to come back to Ann Arbor more than two weeks before classes start to move my stuff out (I'm out of state), which would suck. And I don't know if I'd even be able to put the furniture and belongings in the new house because I don't have a right to be in that house until two weeks after I have to vacate my old house. 

So I wonder if I would have to pay for a few weeks of storage of my belongings, which I would hate to do. Not just that, but I would have to find a place to live for two weeks, between moving out of my old house and into the new one.

So what should I do, or am I screwed and the only solution is spending a ton of money? Should I explain my situation to my current and upcoming landlords and hope they will be willing to let me move stuff in early?",b4p2xd,uofm

MSI graduate (Fall '19) confused about housing options,1,10,"I am an international student exploring housing options.  I have been admitted to the MSI program, and I'm still trying to figure out all the steps I must take before joining the program. Housing is one of them. So, here goes:

• I want to be close to my department. So, should I be looking for housing near the North or Central campus (I am still unable figure out where exactly all my classes will be held).

• My price range is ($300-500). Should I opt for off-campus or on-campus housing?

Commuter lots,5,10,"Hey guys, 
I'm a sophomore and have always lived off campus. Right now I park at the state street commuter lot and take The Ride bus that goes to and from campus. For the most part it works fine for me. I recently started working early hours for my job. Usually I'll park in a garage for work and then move my car to the lot before classes so I'm not paying all day. The issue is that on Wednesdays I work 6am-8am with a class following right after. I don't have time to move my car to the lot and really can't afford the parking garage for my whole day of classes. Are there any lots that have buses that come earlier than 6am? State street commuter lot doesn't. I work in the league if that helps at all.",db9vaf,uofm

Measles exposure at U of M,85,26,"In a horrible twist of irony, immediately after Washtenaw County health officials confirmed that the previous measles report was a false alarm, this came through an email today. VACCINATE YOUR GODDAMN KIDS.

TL;DR-- Measles exposure took place at North Quad, IM Sports Complex, North Quad, and several other off-campus locations listed below.   


Greetings, U-M Ann Arbor students (and identified family), faculty and staff,

An international visitor to the U-M Ann Arbor campus – who has now returned home  – was confirmed today as having measles.

**Anyone who visited the following campus locations on these dates should monitor themselves for rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles over the next couple of weeks**:

* Intramural Sports Building on April 1, 3 and 4
* North Quad Complex on April 3
* Angell Hall Courtyard Computing Site (the Fishbowl) on April 4 and 5   

Exposure may have also occurred in off-campus locations. For details see [https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513](https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513)

Measles is a highly contagious rash illness caused by a virus. Symptoms typically begin with high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. A rash breaks out 3 to 5 days after symptoms begin.  If you develop measles symptoms, especially rash and fever:

* Contact a health care provider as soon as possible. Currently enrolled students on the Ann Arbor campus may call UHS at 734-764-8320, day or night.
* Do not expose others, for example by riding a bus or socializing.

For prevention, make sure you are vaccinated. MMR is a recommended childhood vaccine, and two doses provide about 97% protection against measles. You are considered immune to measles if you received two MMR doses. You’re also considered immune if you had measles or were born before 1957.

You can also protect yourself and others from measles and other respiratory infections by following these steps:

* Cover your cough and clean your hands frequently
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
* Avoid sharing saliva, e.g. sharing cups and eating utensils, and kissing

&#x200B;

How to politely deal with the beggars on/around campus?,76,63,"Since starting school here, I've had beggars shove things into my hands and then ask for money. It's not pleasant, but not unbearable.

Today, I walked less than half a mile off-campus. I saw a beggar approaching me, but I was at the entrance of my destination (a convenience store). The beggar followed me inside the store, waited near the checkout, and then blocked me from paying for my things. He then proceeded to ask me a ton of questions.

I can barely afford rent so I'd be in debt if I gave money to every single person that asked me for some spare cash.

How do I find GRAD housing?,4,6,"Hey all! This is my first post to the U of M community. Incoming grad student over here.

I'm looking for off-campus housing (apartment, house, whatever) starting in August. I'll be coming from the West Coast and probably move in around mid-August. I have no idea where to begin looking for housing! This is really daunting to me, because my housing plan fell through twice when I was in undergrad at another school. I'm still scarred from it (lol but really). It seems like the Facebook page titled ""university of michigan off-campus housing"" is only advertising summer subletting right now. Where do I even begin to look?

Ideally, I want to live with one or two roommates. Looking for someone in the same sex (female) and also in a graduate studies program (master's, law, business, medicine, etc.).

Apparently the landlord tries to see that you're not home before he goes in. They had to get a lawyer involved to make sure that he wouldn't enter again without following protocol (because he did it multiple times-- but there's two people living there and only one car).

I've never been home when it has occurred, but once or twice, certain things have been moved. My broom and mop are in the kitchen against one of the doors.

Questions about U of M parking enforcements?,2,3,"I’m looking at getting a grad student permit that is valid for the orange/yellow/after hours lots but I see the parking website says you can’t park more than 48 hours consecutively in any UM lot. 

Do they enforce this? And would this only be valid during enforcement hours? For example, if a lot is enforced 6am-5pm M-F, does that mean I could park there Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then Tuesday night move my car to go get groceries or something so the 48 hours resets? Or is it 48 hours at all times? 

I will be having field placement 2-3 times a week as well as getting groceries about once a week so if the 48 hours doesn’t count on the weekends, I think I should be okay. I’m wondering if I should look into off campus parking. The university passes are just way cheaper than off campus options as well as a bit closer to where I’m considering living. ",b7dqtb,uofm

Grad Housing Questions,3,7,"Hey guys, I know these questions get asked a lot, so sorry in advance. I'm an incoming engineering grad student and all my classes are going to be on the north campus. That being said, it seems that the buses are convenient enough that I can live closer to central campus if it works out better. My questions are:

1. Since I lived at home for my undergrad, I'm not really sure what to pick for housing. What are some of the pros and cons of living in university housing? I'm contemplating Northwood but it seems like I might be too late already -- I was travelling for the last month unfortunately. If I'm looking for cheap housing, is this pretty much as good of a deal as I'm going to get (vs off-campus)?
2. For off-campus housing, is Craigslist reliable? How is living closer to central vs north campus? I'd like to live in a place where I can meet some new people and hang out, rather than stay in my room most of the time. And keeping costs reasonable is important to me.
3. Should I be finalizing my housing for 2017-2018 right now? I'm not going to be able to visit Michigan until 2-3 weeks from now and I'm not sure if I should wait for a visit first.

Transfer Housing: On Campus or Off Campus,5,28,"I am transferring to UCLA in the fall and I have been back and forth on whether I should do On campus or Off campus living. 

Currently, I live in an apartment with my family and I buy my own groceries and cook my own food. This is comfortable for me. I enjoy having my own space, my own food, and a place to relax that isn't public. When I first looked into UCLA, I heard of the University Apartments and was very interested. A bit cheaper than on\-campus, and I get my own space and kitchen to do everything I already do currently at home.

However, I spoke to a friend attending UCLA who said she stronglyyyy recommends I spend at least a quarter or two in a dorm. Specifically, a transfer dorm such as a plaza, etc. She said it's important for the adjustment to be on campus, meet friends, and be close to everything you need while you gain your footing. Because UCLA is indeed big and albeit terrifying, I was considering her words as it would be nice to meet people. I'm unsure of how easy it would be to meet people in apartments, but I had already planned to join several clubs and organizations during my first quarter.

At the same, I feel like I'm missing out on the RA stuff and being with freshmen and the ""College experience"" and all that that stupid jazz we buy into. I'm an international student, coming from England, so I'm a bit worried about socialising (because I kinda suck at it big time). Although, I'm coming for the Winter/Spring quarter.

My on campus job hasn't paid me for the past four weeks. The reason for the late pay is for some bullshit reason on behalf of HR, so I can't and won't blame my boss for this shit. But I've been out of money for the past two weeks. I owe my friends money because I needed to pay for gas to get to my two unpaid internships. I'd be saving money if I had a parking pass on campus so I wouldn't have to park so far north. But UCLA won't give me a pass because ""my off-campus internships are not sources of income"" and for that reason I don't qualify for parking. It's like Sunglass Hut refusing to sell me sunglasses cuz I walked in on a fucking foggy day.

I'm sitting here in class right now unable to concentrate because of all of this. I have no money. I have so many responsibilities I'm juggling at once. My professor barely speaks speaks English and we're learning difficult mathematical concepts. I have a paper due next week for a GE class that has no relevance for the career I want to have. I have so much pressure to deal with, which I am capable of doing, but UCLA keeps dishing me so much fucking unnecessary bullshit that everything is way harder than it truly needs to be. I can't even imagine what it's like for other Bruins who have less money that me. I truly feel inferior to them; they are persevering and overcoming the obstacles of REAL financial stress and I am unable to do so myself.

Yes, I signed up for all of this by choosing to go to college. But fairly said, UCLA fucking sucks because of all of the flaws that come with running such a big system. And fuck my professor. Yes, I should put my laptop away so I can try to pay attention but I'm TRIPPIN right now because of actual life issues... and I'm supposed to go to class and try to decipher this lady's English. We're at such an amazing institution and I can't even understand my professor. LIT. And I've had professors like this before. Fuck all of my friends who are going to easy colleges and enjoying themselves. I'm so jealous of them. I want that so badly right now.

Commuter Without A Parking Permit,5,10,"**Insight:** 

Hello, I'm an incoming transfer student. It looks like I didn't do enough research into how useful a parking permit would be for my first quarter at UCLA, and dropped the ball on being able to obtain one.

Financial Aid is giving me a lot more than I thought. Will it change?,38,28,"I’m a severely low-income student, and I just got my financial aid offer, and I’ll be receiving around 24k for this year.

We would want to stay on CA near the student center/scott hall area- not more than maybe a 5-7 min walk. Looking for ONLY apartments not a house. ALSO we would want to know if they let us know about availability now or like 2 months before the school year because I think some places do that. 

Basically can anyone give info on the following places (and suggestions are appreciated too!):
-rent price, utilities, co-signing, lease duration, subletting, location, safety, parking, noise, quirks, etc.

Or do they screw you and only pay for tuition? Can anyone explain how it works? Thanks a lot.

PSA for off-campus students -- Watch out for door-to-door utility bill scammers this time of year,91,8,"We've had two people come by in the past two days so far this year, a few more last year at our off-campus house near Hamilton st. They will often start off the conversation saying that they have come to speak with you about a notice on your utility bill, pretending that they are with your utility provider without outright saying it. They then will ask to see your utility bill and try to get you to sign up for their fixed-rate utility company under the guise of helping you lower your bill

&#x200B;

They try their hardest to avoid saying they are from another utility company and that they won't make it clear that they're trying to sell you something. They will also try to make it seem like they are official, as if they are from the city of New Brunswick, dressed nicely, often holding some sort of tablet so they can get you to sign up on the spot for a two year contract with the company

&#x200B;

If you do sign up and want out, make sure to call the company immediately. My experience has been that they are from Direct Energy and they may try to get a cancellation fee. From what I remember from last year, if you call within a certain time frame (48 hours or something), they have to let you cancel the contract without a cancellation fee

Paying for off campus housing out of pocket?,3,9,"I'm not in college yet, but I will be within a year. My plan is to commute from home freshman year and work a part-time job year round. Then in sophomore year I'll still have the job but also I could probably afford off campus housing during the school year and be home during summer months. I would be paying for the housing with the money from my part time job. I'm just not sure if I could actually raise enough money to do this.

From what I've seen, off campus housing usually costs about 600 a month so it should  be about 5400 per school year which is much cheaper than dorming. Is my estimate correct? Has anyone here tried paying for the off campus housing on their own while working a job? Did it work out well? Any tips?

Edit: I plan on majoring in design or computer science. I haven't decided yet.

As a side note,  the reason I don't want to continue commuting from home is because my mom is pretty controlling and won't let me be my own person. She would probably have me come home when classes are over and she won't let me hang out with friends. I'd never get to go to parties or have that college experience I guess.

Off Campus Housing question(s),8,13,"Hey guys,

Me and my(4) roommates somewhat recently decided to try and live off campus for the next year (2019-2020). Since then we’ve scoured Places4Students, Zillow, Facebook groups and a bunch of other random websites posted throughout this subreddit. We’re mainly looking for places in New Brunswick near College Ave

We’ve found a few addresses that look nice and have reached out to the landlords to hopefully start a discussion, but we’re still kind of lost. We’re going to get in contact with RUs office of off campus housing, but we still had some general questions. 

- when do people generally start to look for housing? Are we too early here?

- how much extra are utilities (water, gas, electric, internet/cable, air conditioning/heat) a month?

- where are the unsafe areas? I’ve read that the closer you are to Huntington/CAC you are, the better, but I’ve also heard the opposite as well as some streets like Delafield being bad news. 

- are there certain landlords to steer clear of, or ones I should be looking for that are better than average?

- any ins and outs of renting? Like renters insurance, or taking pics before you move in?

Thanks guys, hopefully I can get most of these questions answered by Rutgers but I couldn’t find any of these on the subreddit or throughout google. ",a1wc2l,rutgers

Off-campus housing suggestions?,6,9,"Hello, I'm going to be considered a junior next year. I've tired of dorm life, and am looking to apply for off-campus housing. I applied for ""off-campus"" housing on my FAFSA.

For starters, I'm an introvert who likes my privacy, so not too keen on the idea of a roommate. Also would like the typical ""decent apartment/housing"" scene, with a kitchen, my own bathroom, free laundry and etc.

Also, good parking space, no parallel parking. While located near campus, walking distance would be my ""top choice"", if must be, driving distance is fine (as long as it's not morbidly far, a 15-minute drive at most, and I mean 15-minutes without stops, if it ends up being 20 minutes or 16 minutes, it's fine). 

Some suggestions?

I did look into Blackbird Farms, since it is considered ""off-campus"", but students still enjoy meal swipes and and etc. However, I changed my mind after all the bad reviews I've seen.

Now, if ""all"" of those expectations can't be met, still, I'd like recommendations for good off-housing campus, anything you can give.

Dtella (Purdue's secure file sharing community) is still alive and well with some major changes! New students and off-campus students should really read this!,109,39,"There have been quite a few questions this last year if Dtella is still a thing or if it is dead. Dtella lives on, and will be supported for the foreseeable future. 

**News:** There is a new [dtella client](http://dtella.net/app/installer/) that all users will need to download! Dtella will not work without it! **Dtella will now work on PAL!** After hundreds of requests, we have made Dtella PAL-compatible again. At this point we are confident in PAL's setup. There is a chance that something could go wrong, please contact us [here](http://webchat.dtella.net/?channels=dtella2.0). 

Again, you **must** [download the new client](http://dtella.net/app/installer/) for Dtella to work! This installer can also install ApexDC++ which is the official DC client for Dtella and highly recommended for all users. If you are already using Apex, you don't need to check that box. For all returning users: this new client will not know your old port settings. You will need to reset those.

**New Users:** What is Dtella you ask? Dtella is a file sharing network that is limited to Purdue students. The network is very secure and has anything you can dream about (if its not there, we can get it). Before getting to campus, you can [read the FAQ](http://dtella.net/faq/), install the [Dtella client](http://dtella.net/app/installer/) (it won't work until you are on campus), or [chat with us](http://webchat.dtella.net/?channels=dtella)!

**Issues and new website:** By now returning users have noticed that we are using a new website: [dtella.net](http://dtella.net). This website is the **only** website that is up to date and maintained by the current Dtella staff! The dtella.org website and IRC servers are still running but will not get you the new installer, the current dtella chat, or correct information. Our new website is still under content development, so there may be a few things missing that will be added shortly.

Feel free to [get in contact with us](http://webchat.dtella.net/?channels=dtella) if you have any questions, and remember: Sharing is Caring!",39y81f,Purdue

Choice of off campus accommodations,1,5,"Hello all! Exchange student heading to Purdue in the upcoming Fall term, looking for some advice on off campus accommodations. Shortlisted two locations based on whatever's available, namely Village West and a rental apartment from Evergreen Rentals. 

Village West is around $480/month inclusive of utilities and facilities. It seems to be quite a distance from Purdue and I've read that Village West is rebranded from Willowbrook West which was not great. Comes fully furnished though.

Evergreen is along East Columbia Street and around $550/month, not including internet and electricity which adds up to $75 per person (estimated). Furnishing not guaranteed, probably limited to beds and basic items (unconfirmed). Much more expensive but location's much better.

Any advice on which location I should choose or should I look elsewhere? Cost and location are definitely two of the main factors that I'm concerned with. Having difficulty trying to find short term leases as many places have ran out of them already and not sure whether I want to risk getting a full year lease then finding someone else to sublease to later. Will be sharing the apartment with other students from my home university as well. Thanks in advance!

On-campus vs Off-campus housing questions,0,17,"Alright, I know this question must be asked a million times a year, but I was wondering if I could get some info/advice about living arrangements. I signed a housing contract yesterday, and I really don't care which dorm I am in, but I am having second thoughts because I could avoid almost all loans (in-state student here) if I stayed in an apartment, worked a few hours a week, and split housing costs with someone. It's insane to me that I should take on significant student loans to pay almost $1,000 a month for a cramped dorm and a meal plan. I know most of you have navigated this, what's your setup? Is living off campus worth the savings?

I know I might miss out on some cool on-campus experiences, but what I am more concerned about is avoiding debt! Is there a place to find a roommate who wants to live off-campus, if this is even a good idea? ",34qq8m,Purdue

Off-campus accomodation that has a community of Purdue students,2,3,"Hi,



I'm going to be attending Purdue as a master's student and I'm looking for off-campus housing. I've considered Purdue Village but it seems to have a really bad reputation and I think I'll dislike living at Hilltop apartments. Are there any off-campus accomodation where there's a community of Purdue students that do stuff together? I'll be an international student and I want to be able to meet new people (students) and easily hang out with a group of Purdue students.



I've taken a look at Fuse, River Market Apartments, and Wabash Landing and all three seem to have the kind of rooms I'm looking for. However, I'm not sure if there are many Purdue students at those three apartments and I'm not sure if the students at those apartments even interact with one another (e.g. I've read a review saying Purdue students at Fuse largely ignore one another unless they already knew each other).",4dqwap,Purdue

Off-Campus Housing recommendations and advice,0,2,"I'm a new international transfer student from Malaysia enrolling in the Fall 2016 semester. I was hoping to get an on-campus housing, but yesterday the university announced that the on-campus housing was full this year and I was placed on the waiting list. I was also asked to consider off-campus housing as a backup. 
Here's the link to their announcement/letter [LINK](http://www.housing.purdue.edu/docs/2016_06_01_UniversityResidences.pdf)

Do you guys think I should accept the on-campus housing offered if I get selected from the waiting list, or is an off-campus housing better?

Furthermore, does anyone have any recommendations on off-campus housing that has similar amenities as the on-campus housing (mainly fast internet) and a community of Purdue students. 

I have done some research on it and found some possible apartments like Faith West, Chauncey Square, and Fairway Apartments. Does anyone have any experience with these places?

How to meet people as an upperclassman?,21,27,"This is kind of embarrassing to write, but here goes. I've been really struggling to meet people while here at Purdue. I transferred in last year from out of state as an upperclassman into an off campus apartment, so I've never lived in the dorms or attended BGR or anything like that. 

I just feel like it's basically impossible at this point to make new friends. It seems like almost everyone I meet already has a well established social group they hang out with. I've been told a lot of people find their friends in class or clubs. In all my classes, there's over 100 people easily, and it seems like they all just play on their phones before class starts, and any attempt on my part to make conversation doesn't yield much results. 

I barely have time for the one club I'm in with the mountain of schoolwork I have to do every week (as in 40+ hours of labs, homework, and studying). I also have a job to try and pay rent, so I have even less free time. I have a couple friends, (which feels like a miracle), but I don't get to see them very often. It's hard being a person with very few friends, and knowing that even with those few, you're towards the bottom of their friend list because they haven't known you very long.

The few people I have tried to hang out with, either from my classes or from other posts on Reddit asking for friends, usually we meet once or twice, then not anymore. I spend pretty much every weekend alone in my apartment because I have no where else to go and no one to hang out with.

I'm at my wits end. My parents had a great time in college, and hang out with their college friends all the time. College has been nothing but lonely and miserable for me so far. My advisor just told me I'll be here for another 2 1/2 years, so I'd really rather not spend that whole time alone. 

I'm not asking for pity, just advice. Thanks",dmy42c,Purdue

Fuck the Hub,133,42,"Hub has fucked over me and my roommates at any chance they could. I understood when they lowered the price after we signed the lease, like, they have to make money. I totally understood when they couldn’t finish the building on time. Just weather delays right? Like it’s not there fault, just indiana weather. But, now I feel like I have been bent over, and just been railed now. The entire building was supposed to move in at 9 A.m on Saturday the 17th. Classes start the 19th. No biggie. Welp, at 9:02 PM everyone gets an email, about how it will not be ready, and they will send more updates soon. So you are telling me, that the hub had no idea that this was going to happen? That all of the sudden, out of nowhere they were not able to get the necessary paperwork to have occupants? That’s Bullshit. They knew, and instead of saying something, and getting blowback, they decided to wait until the last minute to make it seem like uh-oh, accidents happen. I spoke with people at the hub office on Thursday, they were all ready to go. But right after we get this email, all the phones are dead in the office and oops, they can’t return emails yet. So they just drop this bombshell, and walk away. This company is unprofessional, unethical, and purposefully hide the truth from their tenants in order to make them selves look better. Please, please, if you ever look for an off campus apartment, go anywhere else but the hub.

Best mental health alternatives?,11,8,"I'm not much of a sappy or personal person so I'll keep this simple--I've been dealing with my mental health by myself for years now but (after a semester of having panic attacks every day) I finally decided to get over my fears of going to therapy only to figure out that caps is literally useless (I know it's not all their fault, but having to wait months for an appointment really sucks). 

Normally I know people's best advice is joining clubs or reaching out to people around you but I've tried both of those and I just really haven't found a space I fit in here. Not fitting in I can tolerate, but I hate the idea of ruining my education (and wasting all of this money) because of my mental health. I have a good relationship with my parents but it's really hard for me to talk this stuff with them because they take it very personally. I'm still on their insurance (sorry) so I want to be a bit discrete about therapy just so I don't hurt their feelings but I'm not sure if that's going to be possible given that our only student mental health resource is a bit of a mess.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What would be my best resources around/off campus? I live pretty close to campus and I don't have a car so it would be nice if anyone knows of any places in walking/biking/busing distance.

What is the quality of life like living off campus?,8,30,"Hey all,

I kind of have a general question in regards to living at Penn State. I'm moving up from a branch campus and right now me and three other guys are trying to live together and search for the right housing. We have three or four off campus places in mind which include The Heights, The Pointe, The Park, and University Terrace. I know when it comes to location on campus, three out of the four of us will be on the west end of campus for IST and Engineering. 

My question however is what is the quality of life like at these communities off of campus? I was up there today visiting and touring and each of these apartment complexes seems to be it's own little community. For anyone who has lived there or known anyone to have lived there, what is it like? Is it a traditional ""college experience"", is it something else? Does the quality of life suck for someone looking to socialize and have that college experience that he's missed out on by going to a branch campus for two years? 

Thank you and sorry for this jumbled post,

Off Campus living... Where do I even begin,4,3,"So I am starting this spring at UP but am looking to live of campus starting next fall. I know it is a little late to start looking but the variety of options are pretty overwhelming still. A few questions:

Since I don't know a lot of people here, I am looking to live in a place where it's easy to meet people and make friends. I was thinking about living in the retreat, but I am not sure yet. But the only problem with retreat is that it's kinda far.

Are there any off campus apartments that don't have awful lease agreements?,5,11,"So, I understand the housing market here is kind of stacked in favor of landlords in the sense that you can be a literal vegetable and still have people interested in your property, but are the contracts really all that awful?

I'm interested in an off campus apartment but the lease basically says that any damage whatsoever, unless it's caused by gross negligence by the landlord (it never will be), the tenants are responsible. 

So, I can be held accountable for anything that happens even if I didn't cause it. I even heard an example where the landlord charged everyone for trash that wasn't picked up, and while that's not a serious issue, it shows he would be willing to do that for when a pipe bursts or the roof collapses.

Best Quiet Places To Live Off Campus,6,6,"Hello, I am going to be living off campus next year and am wondering what apartments/areas are both affordable and relatively quiet.

While this may work for some people, I do not think I would enjoy chaos on my apartment floor if I was trying to get some work done on a friday night. So my question is, where are good apartments to stay at that are affordable and relatively quiet/peaceful. I am considering staying on campus to avoid said issue.

Also, I've made the decision to go sober since I came to college. What are some good clubs/organization to join that would contain like minded people?

"Having ""retroactive"" FOMO",13,7,"I’m a senior here now and felt like posting about something I feel like I’m going through. I was really introverted in high school and always struggled making friendships outside of forced environments from school and sports. Things didn’t change when I started college because I started at a really small branch of Penn State. I worked a lot for a few years while commuting there but I was still soul searching for what I wanted to major in/do with myself. I jumped around a bit in terms of majors and never made friends. 

I eventually transferred to UP obviously and spent my first two semesters here still searching and without any real friends at all. Having to go directly off-campus did not help and only worsened the isolation. Long story short, I slowly started making effort to get involved in clubs and activities and I found a major that I really love, so that solved a big question mark. Now I’m a senior and slowly but surely I’ve made around around a dozen or solid friends who I talk to or work with on the regular. They came from club involvement, within my major, class work, etc. so we have a lot in common. I used to have absolutely nothing to do outside of class with anyone and I spent all my time alone, but now I at least have something to do occasionally with some people, which is good for my mental health, I think.

The problem is I’m a senior and just as I’m starting to feel much better about my social life and connections, it’s almost over. That’s become the new disappointment. I can’t help but look back and wish things had gone differently, even though I wasn’t that kind of person back then. I wish I had started at main campus, lived in the dorms, bonded with people, etc. I never had those experiences and now that I’ve had sort of a taste of a healthier social life (for me) here, I’m having retroactive FOMO. Now I wish I could spend more time here because I’ve started to really enjoy it, but I graduate in just a few months and then it all falls apart again. I do well making connections in forced environments, but I struggle making connections in all the freer parts of life where everyone is doing different things. I’m still very introverted, but I’m not totally satisfied with that like some are. But I don’t know if that’s really what I feel or if I’m just blindly jealous of those who seem to be living it up 24/7. Is that real life? There seem to be super social people who already have their huge, established circles, and then people who are just uninterested in connecting with others at all. Even now, sometimes when I try to make conversation with people, it seems like many are just miserable and uninterested. The number of people I notice going about their days on campus silently with dreadful looks on their faces is high. It depresses me.

So, to summarize: I’m feeling disappointed again because after a lot of time and effort spent creating real friendships, I’ll be graduating soon and then it’ll be all over and I’ll feel completely alone again. I understand that you just have to keep making friends wherever you go, wherever you work, but it’s just so hard and draining for me. I’m having retroactive FOMO because I never had the experiences of living on campus and being close with people and it seems like those experiences are fun and important. If anyone else has ever felt the same type of thing, or has any input to offer, please share :)",dap2s5,PennStateUniversity

# General questions:

&#x200B;

**Q: What's going on this \*INSERT WEEK/TIME/DATE HERE\*? How can I find out what events are going on on campus?**

A: For career/academic related events, please check your emails. I don't know about other majors, but for my majors Cmpsc and Math, I get plenty of email basically every day about what companies are on campus/ what companies are looking for internships/jobs, clubs etc.

For fun stuff, unironically ironicly... go to the bathroom in the HUB. They have potty paper (I'm not kidding, this is what they are called) that tell you a list of upcoming events. The HUB also have posters that show you events as well.

&#x200B;

**Q: Probably the question everyone is dying to ask: HOW DO I GET ON THE GUEST WIFI?**

A: Connect to Attwifi, follow instruction from there

&#x200B;

**Q: Will PSU degree X help me finding job/internship Y?**

A: For some reason this questions get ask like a million time. Let me ask you this: Does going to MIT for let’s say, CS, guarantee you a job as a Software Engineer? Maybe, maybe not, you can’t say for sure, it’s very likely, but it’s depend on the person right? It depend on their grades, it depend on how good they are at interview, it depend on how they represent their resume, etc. It’s the same at PSU. I know plenty of PSU students who are working at big tech like Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc, but I also know Cmpsc students who struggle to find a job for more than a year. Now, if you want to rephrase the question to: “Does companies recruit on campus?” Absolutely! I only know about Cmpsc, but we have basically all the big tech here + some financial one like Capital One, Deloitte, JP Morgan Chase recruiting.

You are in charge of your career future, PSU can only help you work toward that goal, but you still have to put in the effort to make it come true

&#x200B;

**Q: Should I study for ALEKS math exam?**

A: Probably not. ALEKS math exam is there purely to put you in appropriate level math class. I.e if you score high, you get placed in Math 140 or something (calculus 1). So I mean, don't fret out too much. If you do bad, just mean you start at a lower level math class, but can be good for your grade since it probably easy A, and refresh your memory/prep you for calculus.

&#x200B;

**Q: I'm struggling in my classes, what can I do?**

A: Generally: Go to office hours for help, try to read the textbook before class to get a general sense of the materials, so at the very least you see the material twice (once in the textbook, once in the lecture). Get a tutor, as a PSU student you have access to free tutoring through the university (well technically not free since it's paid already through your tuition). Also something i find really helpful is to actively listen instead of just jotting down notes. Most of the time professors teach their lectures from the textbook or slides anyway, no need to write down notes, just use the textbook or the slides. I would rather actively listening than write notes.

&#x200B;

**Q: Welp, I'm probably gong to fail this class. What should I do?**

A: If you think there's nothing you can do (after talking to your professor and everything), you probably should drop it. There's no shame in dropping a class, although keep in mind that it will show up on your transcript as a LD, but your GPA won't be affected. Now, do keep in mind that a. if you are on financial aids, if late drop put you below full time student status, your aid might be affected, and b. you can only retake a class 2 times, so, pick your battle wisely.

# Housing Questions:

&#x200B;

**Q: On-campus or off-campus for housing?**

A: Again, really depend on what you want. On-campus housing is definitely more expensive, requiring you to get a meal plan, but it can be very convenient if you want to attend events around the campus. Off-campus is cheaper, usually come with kitchen and your own bathroom, so I think it mostly depend on what you want.

&#x200B;

**Q: Which on-campus housing complex should I pick?**

A: The general consensus seem to be AVOID POLLOCK. But otherwise, seem like it really depend on your majors and preference. If you are in an engineering major, West is probably best since it's close to a lot of engineering classes. North for businesses, South for access to downtown/hub.

&#x200B;

**Q: I'm a freshie! I'm so excited to live on my own apartment somewhere downtown.**

A: Suck to be you, all freshmen are required to live on campus. Also not a question, but it good to know

&#x200B;

**Q: I'm currently living off campus, can I move to on-campus?**

A: If you are lucky, yes, it's a lottery system. If you get lucky and get pick, then you can.

&#x200B;

# Branch campuses questions:

&#x200B;

**Q: Are branch campuses easier/harder/not as prestigious/different school?**

A: Whether you find branch campuses easier/harder is really depend on the person, and it is also depend on the professors. I know plenty of people who found UP to be such a step up and that their branch campuses classes were a joke, but I myself found UP to be easier than my branch campus (LV). All branch campuses degrees are still Penn State degree regardless, and even if you spend all 4 years at Branch, you can still list on your resume as ""Pennsylvania State University"" without listing the branch.

**Q: Are you guaranteed to transfer to UP?**

A: Generally yes, there are some specific situation like trying to change your major after you transfered (from another university/community college) to a branch campus where UP won't allow you to come if you start at a different major, but usually yes. As long as you finish your ETM/and take classes at reasonable pace that match with 2+2 options, you definitely can go to UP.

&#x200B;

**Q: I have some personal reason I need to go to UP, even before I finish my 2 years at a branch/I need to go to UP later. Can I do that?**

A: Generally, yes, as long as you can provide a reasonable reason (usually a. branch campus don't provide specific class, or only offer it at specific semester, so if you stay at branch to take that class at that specific semester it might make you behind your schedule, financial complication (you transfered with 1 semester worth of credit,  so you only need to stay at branch for 1.5 years, but your apartment only offer year long lease, so if you stay there for half a year it would be a lot more expensive and become a financial burden). No matter what you do, when you go onto LionPATH to change campus, you have to provide a reason/get it approved (even if you finished the 2 years at branch, you still have to say something like ""Finished requirement for 2+2 at branch"" and wait for it to get manually approved).

&#x200B;

**Q: Any advantage/disadvantage to going to a branch over UP?**

A: Yes and no, it really depend on what you want. At branch campuses classes are definitely a lot smaller, I think the biggest class I had at branch was about 60 person. I also find it a lot easier to make connection with professors and some of my most favorite professors have been from branch campuses. Another thing is tuition price, going to branch on average save you about 2-5k per semester (i.e if branch tuition is 6k, UP is 8-11k). Branch campuses does lack when it come to social/involvement event though, since there are less student i.e less club i.e less events going around.

# World campuses questions:

**Q: I'm a student currently at ""INSERT CAMPUS NAME HERE"" trying to get into a course on world campus. Can I get into it?**

A: Yes, subject to availability. But you have to email world campus registrar [registrar@outreach.psu.edu](mailto:registrar@outreach.psu.edu) and tell them which class you want to add.

**Q: Are online classes at PSU real classes? Are they harder/easier/easy to cheat?**

A: This really depend on the professors, some professors don't care enough and make it a cake walk, but I had to work my ass off for some online classes I took \*COUGH HIST 20 COUGH\* where professor make you write essays every week. Some professors also require you to get a proctor to take exam, so take online classes as you will. If you are concern, probably look into ratemyprofessor before you take the class

**Q: How are some exams at World Campus proctored?**

A: Thank to [u/GoChaca](https://www.reddit.com/u/GoChaca) for the answer:

As far as he know, there are 2 ways exam are proctored:You find someone in position of authority (like a manager at your job), let the professor know, they will email that person an access code, which then that person will give it to you for you to take the exam when the time come (and that person will ensure you won't cheat and such). The other method is that there's an online company that PSU use for monitoring process. You schedule the exam, download the program and connect. A proctor will appear on video (in the program) and ask to inspect your room by making you walk your laptop around the room to ensure you don't have notes or things to cheat with, as well as watch you the entire time you take the test.

&#x200B;

**Q: I'm thinking of doing Software Engineering degree via WC, can you tell me more about what it is? Is it the same as University Park's degree?**

A: Software Engineering via World Campus is offered exclusively through World Campus and Penn State Behrend. The degree itself does not exist anywhere else but those 2 campuses. It's basically a modified Computer Science degree focusing more on the practical aspect of programming, like actually coding, building application, whera Computer Science do a lot more theory such as Automata Theory/Computing Theory (Cmpsc 464) and so on.

# Majors related questions:

&#x200B;

**Q: My GPA is not high enough/ I missed my credit window, can I still get into my major?**

A: There is no definitive answer on this, whether you can get in or not is based on a case by case basis, talk to your advisor. Some was able to get in, some was not.

LPT: You can conditionally enter your majors, just ask your advisor. For some reasons I didn't get into Math230 on time, and it was the only class left in my ETM, and by the time I finish the class I would have more credit than the required credit window for Cmpsc. I asked my Cmpsc advisor and he allowed me to enter the major conditionally while I'm still in the credit window, and as long as I do well in my Math 230 class, I can stay in Cmpsc (if I fail I would get move out of Cmpsc ofc).

&#x200B;

**Q: Can I double major in X and Y?**

A: If both X and Y are controlled majors, no, BUT there are exception, refer to department website for specific list, such as ([https://advising.engr.psu.edu/student-resources/multiple-majors.aspx](https://advising.engr.psu.edu/student-resources/multiple-majors.aspx)).

If X is controlled and Y is not, yes, but make sure you enter X first.

If neither is controlled, go ahead!

&#x200B;

**Q: What's my chance to get into X? Should I apply as DUS?**

A: No one here can really say with 100% confident whether you will get into X, and while there are no official statistic on whether DUS are more than likely to get in, the general consensus seem to be if you get rejected to say, CS or something, you can apply as DUS, then change your major after you study there for a semester or something. \*BIG OMEGA NOTE\*: I don't know about DUS specifically, BUT for transfer student admitted to BRANCH CAMPUS, if you plan to change your major into one that is controlled AND end at University Park, DOUBLE CHECK WITH A UNIVERSITY PARK ADVISOR. I have a friend who started Data Science at Abington who can't change his major into Pre-Engr/Cmpsc and go to UP because the College of Engineering don't allow that.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story is, when in doubt, ALWAYS double check with the advisors SPECIFICALLY AT THE CAMPUS YOU PLAN TO GO TO (i.e if you start at Lehigh Valley and end at UP, make sure to ask advisor at UP too). For a list of advisors, well, google it. There are always informations about PSU advisors online, but, here are some for references, let me know if I miss any:

# Courses related Question:

&#x200B;

**Q: Are courses X substitutable for Y?**

A: NOTE: THIS LIST IS PROBABLY INCOMPLETE:

Cmpsc 360 and Math 311W are equivalent

Math 318-319, 414-415/Statistic 318-319, 414-415 are equivalent (respectively)

Cmpsc 451, 455 and Math 451, 455 are equivalent

&#x200B;

**Q: I took Cmpsc 121/122 instead of Cmpsc 131/132, is this okay?**

A: Yes. 131 and 132 is basically the replacement of Cmpsc 121/122 at University Park, and taught in Python. If you took 121/122, don't worry about it, you are fine.

&#x200B;

**Q:  What's the different between Math 230, 231, and 232?**

A: Math 230 is the full calculus 3 class. Math 231 is the first half, Math 232 is the second half. You could take Math 230, OR BOTH 231 and 232 and they together is equivalent to Math 230. If you are worried about getting bad grade, a strategy is you could take 231 AND 232 instead of 230, so that you can get 2 chances of getting A instead of 1.

&#x200B;

**Q: Similarly, what's the different between Cmpen 270, 271, and 275?**

A: Cmpen 270 is the full class, 271 is the lecture only, 275 is the lab only. UP no longer offer 271 and 275 on its own, only 270. However you can still find 271 and 275 at branch campuses.

&#x200B;

**Q: I heard that you might get transferred out of your selected CAPSTONE courses, is this true?**

A: Yes, it is true. The Capstone class/section you end up getting assigned to is DEPENDENT on the projects you signed up for. So take me for example, I am a Computer Science major, I sign up for Cmpsc 483W, It's a Cmpsc Capstone, the first lecture I have the professor tell me what to expect, as well as tell me to go to a Penn State website to select projects. I have to mark 10 projects i like and 2 projects I absolutely don't want to do. And based on what I select and other people select, we get assigned to different project, which then result a change Capstone courses/section depend on which department hosting that Capstone project. So let say I get assigned to an Industrial Engineering project, then my new Capstone lecture would be in IE XXX whatever the number is for Capstone. If you are worried about the lecture time (if you get assigned to a class in different time you can't make etc), when you search for a project, there are filter for time slot so you are only assigned to time that you are available.

# Foodie related question:

&#x200B;

**Q: Should I get meal plan? Is it worth it?**

A: Short answer: Hell no. Long answer: Really depend, but probably not. There have been a lot of discussion regarding whether meal plans are worth it or not, and the general consensus seem to be that it isn't worth it. The meal plan don't make the food at dining commons free, you still have to pay to eat at dining common even with the meal plan, albeit at a discount rate. I believe someone did the math and found out that you have to eat a lot of dining common to make up for the initial meal plan payment (i.e eat there practically every meal or so). If you really want to eat at dining common, getting the commuter plan is probably your best bet.

&#x200B;

**Q: How's the dining common experience?**

A: Generally pretty good, keep in mind that they are almost always understaffed because basically the entire cook/server team is student-employed, and I think not a lot of students want to work in dining common. I personally never had any problems at dining common, but yeah. This also mean that if you are desperate for income, you are basically guaranteed a job at dining common if you apply.

**Q: Best food place evar?**

A: Big bowl

...

No really, big bowl is great

...

Fine, I'm biased, but it's kinda hard to get a good answers since it's subjective. I personally love Big Bowl as far as Chinese food goes, but other contender would be Little Food Court. For Japanese food there are Tadashi. Korean: There are Kimchi Korean if you are willing to go far/can drive, or The Coop (Waker) for Korean Fried Chicken. For Vietnamese food there's Pho 11, although as a Vietnamese person, I think the place is alright, it is definitely not authentic/catered more toward Chinese/White people taste. Please send me a dm with your favorite food suggestions and I will include it here.

&#x200B;

**Q: What's the different between the two Tadashi?**

A: The one infront of Hammond Building serve ramen, the other one serve Udon and some other stuff (but no ramen). I.e they have different menus.

Accepted for class of 2023!,4,5,"I know there are a lot of posts about people being accepted, so I hope that I'm able to ask some questions that haven't been brought up before.

1. I'm like 99% sure I want to go to Penn State, but I'm worried about the off chance that I decide to go somewhere else. How do I know when I'm ready to commit? And what are the advantages of committing now rather than later?

2. I've always been quite a studious person, but I want to use college as a chance to get out of my shell and really be who I want to be. Throughout all of high school I've always felt like I haven't been able to be myself, but I want to change that in college. I know there's nothing wrong with being an introvert, but what can I do to be more outgoing and more extroverted?

3. I go to a pretty big high school, in a graduating class of around 600. I know a lot of people who plan to go to Penn State, but I wouldn't consider any of them to be my best friends. Am I better off rooming with somebody I am kind of friends with, or taking the chance and rooming with somebody I've never met? I'm leaning towards rooming with somebody I've never met to get exposed to somebody from a different background, but I'm not sure.

4. Where exactly are the parties in State College? I don't think I'd really be into frat parties, so are the other ones just in off-campus housing? How can I get involved in the party scene?

5. Lastly, it feels like my senior year is going so slowly. I'm trying to enjoy it, but all I can think about is being at Penn State next year. What do I do???

The subleaser's room will come with a desk, is on the corner, so has two large windows and a closet, and is the largest bedroom in the house. The rest of the house is fully furnished, and there are four students living here (three girls and a guy), all very very clean, respectful, and quiet (as have all dealt with shitty roommates before). Plenty of street parking is available and there is a single car driveway. The lease starts January 1st and ends in July, but the tenant is welcome to rent for next year as well. Rent is $650/mo plus utilities (around $50) and wifi (7$). Pictures below!

On Campus vs Off Campus Apartment??,4,8,"Ok maybe I'm stupid and I'm doing this calculation wrong but is living off campus cheaper??

A single room in a South Hill Apartment comes out to $5000 per semester. Theres 4 months in a semester which means I would be paying around $1250 per month.

A single in Varsity, View, Landmark all seem to come out less than $1200 per month.

Does this mean Off Campus apartments are actually cheaper?

Universities need to stop policing off-campus behaviour (National Post),5,6,"Article: [https://nationalpost.com/opinion/lindsay-shepherd-universities-need-to-stop-policing-off-campus-behaviour](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/lindsay-shepherd-universities-need-to-stop-policing-off-campus-behaviour)

Tonedeaf or warranted?

>*""The competency of universities is academic, not disciplinary. Let the police and courts handle peace and orderly conduct in public places""*

Author invokes UBC in an off-campus incident dating back 8 years ago, in particular:

>*Not all universities have succumbed to the temptation to rule over students’ off-campus behaviour. In 2011, a \[UBC\] student was caught on video at the infamous Vancouver Stanley Cup riot stealing two pairs of pants from a formalwear store. After being named and shamed on social media, many called on UBC to expel her. The university however, declined to expel her or to impose any disciplinary action, stating it was leaving the consequences of her looting to the police and the courts.*  
>  
>*We need less hyperbole and more UBC-like prudence in such cases. The competency of universities is academic, not disciplinary, and their disciplinary record is often poor. Universities should let the police and courts handle peace and orderly conduct in public places.*

She omits other noteworthy incidents of misconduct discipline that oppose her argument, such as one of the very next year following the reference she used, in 2012 (via [Ubyssey](https://issuu.com/ubyssey/docs/ubyssey_25oct12)):

>*""UBC investigates involvement of \[students\] in an* [*anonymous Twitter account*](http://ubcinsiders.ca/2012/10/more-than-a-bystander/) *and* [*website*](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd81d2821000035007ce149.jpeg) *that solicited non-consensual photos of women on campus … UBC Director of Public Affairs Lucie McNeill says, '\[People\] complained about the sexist nature of that language, and had concerns that … some of the posts, they felt, were getting pretty close to harassment. A number of \[students\] who were deemed to have some connection with the incident were called into an emergency meeting with UBC \[administrators.\] They were encouraged to make sure that the website and the Twitter account were deleted.'""*",ddhdl1,UBC

Do students just not go off-campus to study anymore?,13,8,"I noticed after [Calhoun's shut down](https://www.ubyssey.ca/culture/calhouns-shuts-down/), undergrads seemed to be a lot less likely to go to a place off campus to study. 

A few students said in my section that I TA that they only study on-campus or at home these days. 

Is this because there are a lot more places to study on campus than in the past? More housing for students? Or did the culture just die with Calhoun's shutting down? Speaking of which, has anyone ever find a 24/7 replacement for Calhoun's?",bamdwr,UBC

The problem with coffee shops is that apart from Starbucks, a lot of the smaller ones give you the stink eye if you stay longer than an hour without buying another drink or pastry but there's only so much caffeine and carbs I can take in one day.

In your browser make a new bookmark, and choose whatever you want for the name, but in the URL write

    javascript:void(location.href=""http://ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/login?url=""+location.href)

(make sure you have javascript enabled)

So, if you're at, say, 

    http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/466856

Finding off-campus housing in UBC as an exchange student,2,12,"I will be spending a semester in UBC as an exchange student next fall semester from september to the end of december.

To be honest, I'm a little discouraged by these, circumstances, and even considered giving up on exchange.

Living on vs. off-campus second year,6,14,"I'm going into second year, and I'm trying to decide whether I should live on or off-campus next year. 

On-campus would NOT be in res, but in a private apartment (either rented from a private individual or my parents buying it and me paying rent to them). Off-campus would be the same.

The place I'm looking at off-campus is around Granville & West Broadway. On-campus is near Fairview res. 

I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who's experienced either/both of my options. Cost isn't really a factor (seems pretty similar for both). I think the biggest concern is how difficult it is to commute (as opposed to walking) and maintain a social life (in a place like the Granville apartment).

Thanks!


Edit: Thanks to everyone for the responses, I really appreciate them (and I'm sure others will as well). Updating my situation, my parents' made an offer on the place I discussed above, and it was accepted today -- so it looks like that's where I'll be living.

Off-campus housing in August - difficult?,1,5,"Hi,

I'm a UBC alumnus considering coming back for a master's next year. Some circumstances will mean I'll probably only be able to start looking for housing - ideally off-campus along 4th - in early August.

Is this difficult? I was fortunate in my undergrad and never had to look for off-campus housing. I hear July and August can be quite difficult.

However a quick look at padmapper, rentline, craigslist, et cetera suggests otherwise - it looks like there's still plenty of places available. I'm not too picky; as long as there's in suite laundry and not too noisy I don't really mind.

Any tips here? Personal experiences? I have a suspicion that the truth is somewhere between nightmarish and uncomplicated and not at the extreme ends of that spectrum. I'll have the entire month of August to find a good place. 

How does the housing search in August compare to the housing search in May? 

Cheers

edit: should probably add that I'm looking to spend $1,500/month at the most, ideally closer to $1,100-1,350. ",2dzqs4,UBC

Help an international freshman with off-campus housing?,3,5,"I confirmed my admission to UBC yesterday, only to realize that the housing deadline has long since gone (may 1). 
UBC now tells me that it is extremely unlikely that I will get on-campus housing. Should I even apply for housing this term or should I apply next term itself?

Since then I've been terribly anxious. I've come across off-campus providers like transamline but couldn't find rooms for the school term. Could someone please tell me when they will become available?

I plan to live close to campus, so I'd like to know which areas offer the best balance of price and proximity to campus. If possible, I want to be able to cycle to university.

Apart from this, will I stand at a disadvantage with regards to social life? Besides learning to cook, what cheap and healthy food options are available?

Why is it so hard to make friends?,48,32,"Hi folks,

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to complain here. It's my first/second year (academic concession) here and I'm genuinely alone. I live off campus so not being in res was a major downfall, I have joined clubs but it still feels like theres a friendly distance between me and the individual. To this day, I still sit in an area where people will always leave a space to my left and right. No one in the discussion/labs want to really hang out and everyone else I'm seeing already has a group of friends. What the heck. 

And when I do go out of my way to talk to people, I'm genuine and try my best to ask a lot of questions about them. I feel more like a moderator than a friend. Like I'm interviewing them? I thought it was common courtesy to ask back but.. okay.

I'm not a storyteller, nor am I hilarious. But I'm genuine and I really care for the friends I do have.

Diagnosed with ADHD but no regular doctors available at UBC Student Health Services,3,12,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, have started meds, and was following this through with a specific doctor at the UBC Student Health Centre. I have seen this doctor for a few months and really like them, but the problem is their schedule is very rigid. They're only here one day a week, and they're also fully booked for the next month. Since I just started medication, I'm supposed to meet every 2 weeks to adjust my dosage/type of meds if needed, and to refill my prescription. I was actually forced to see another doctor today, because my regular doctor was unavailable, and I have got to say, the appointment was very unproductive. They barely looked at my history, didn't really ask me anything, and it made me uncomfortable asking them to up my dosage. I thought about maybe just switching to another doctor, but none of the doctors are available regularly. I really don't want to keep switching doctors every 2 weeks just to find one that ""fits"" with me, especially when I'm trying to find the right dose of medication I need for me to function at school.

The lady at the reception suggested I call in to see if there are any cancelled appointments with my preferred doctor. Has anyone had any experience with this? Should I just try to find another doctor off campus? I don't have a family doctor, so I've been going to walk-in clinics if I needed to, but I'm not sure if walk-in clinics would adjust ADHD meds since they don't know my history.",ds4jxy,UBC
Piano practice spaces?,4,18,"Hey all, I’m in my last year but for the last three I’ve been practicing piano in the Totem ballroom (on that beautiful baby grand) quite a few times a month, I’ve been playing for 18 years but it’s nice to have somewhere I can play a piano with a nice timbre and attack, it’s really helpful for composing as composing on my $200 midi keyboard is much harder than composing on a piano that feels like a piano. Unfortunately there’s now a piano lock on that baby grand, and the totem front desk told me it’s not theirs and they don’t have the key for it. 

Such a shame, since he seemed bummed they don’t get to listen to students playing anymore, but it’s not like UBC hasn’t been doing plenty of dumb shit recently so what do you expect. Point is, I’ve never looked for music practice spaces on campus, but I kinda have to now. Can’t do anything in residence as I live off campus now, so if anyone has any info on where else I can go for this sort of thing, that would be amazing.

Housing-related questions posted anywhere else will be removed.

A couple of notes: 

* Please provide us with as much *pertinent* information as possible. If you don't know what to put in a certain field of your application, take a screenshot of the application, but we probably don't need to know what program you're in - unless it has a non-standard start/end date. 
* Everyone is always more helpful when it seems like you've already tried to solve your problem. Try to answer your own questions, first, and then tell us what you did. 
* Housing processes change every year, and nobody here works for UBC (unless they state otherwise and are moderator-verified). 
* Try to ask several small questions instead of one big one. For example, don't ask if you should apply for residence - that's totally subjective. Ask specific questions you have about residence which can be answered conclusively, and draw your own conclusions from the responses you get. 
* Remember that everyone is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. 
* Upvote good answers: saying 'thanks' is nice, but if someone helped you out, upvotes will make the information more visible to everyone. 
* **Important:** Do not PM people asking for advice. PMs are both annoying, and you're the only one who can see the answer you get. Post it here in the megathread where others can see it, and apply it to their situation as is relevant.
* **Important:** Please keep in mind that it's been a minimum of a year since most of us have done anything related to housing. You're going to need to jog our memories if you have questions about anything specific - what you're trying to figure out might not have even been possible last year. Anonymized screenshots or the exact wording and context of the question will help you get better answers.

I've been in a tight spot for a month now. I'm working a lot to pay my rent as I live off campus. I'm a 1st year. I've only been eating once a day when I'm home as I'm not able to bring food to campus. My family cant help me at this point as I come from a less fortunate family. 

Idk if anyone can help or if begging is even a good choice at this point. I've already used all my visits to the on campus food bank and the city food banks are only open when I have classes. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for all your great suggestions and those people who messaged me. I will definitely take advantage of some of the off campus meals once classes are over and I'm working more. Also big thanks to those people who have offered to help with cash and student card money. I'm honestly so thankful that people were actually kind enough to offer and follow through as on other sites and subreddits I've received some hate and backlash. Thank you all. ",b5tzv3,UBC

Taking four courses instead of five?,9,9,"Hey everyone! Sorry for the long post, but everyone's advice is welcome :) I took a term off and am getting everything ready to return in September. I'm still a first year student and have only completed one full term. I'm trying to tweak my situation a bit so it doesn't end in the same sort of catastrophe it did when I left.

I live off campus, about 1.5-2 hours away, with my grandparents (not the greatest environment but I'd rather avoid debt from dorms). We found out my mom was terminally ill around the time I was moving in with them, and that sort of threw me off. I ended up having a late withdrawal from one of my five courses because I couldn't keep up with everything going on. My average was \~73% and I'm hoping to do CS so that has to change.

I know everybody's experience is different so nobody can give the perfect answer for me, but those of you which have originally done five and downgraded to four, did it end up okay for you? Also, is it reasonable to finish a Bachelor's in 5-6 years rather than the usual four? It's already going to take me at least five years, would another be too much if I decided to take things even slower?

Are winter sublets or short term leases common or easy to find?,9,5,"Like the title suggests, I'm looking into moving near campus, but I don't want to commit to a long term lease. I'm not feeling super confident about getting residence (my lowest is 300 for YRH and I'm somewhere in the 1000s for winter). I've been looking at other options, but at this time of the year, all I can find are summer sublets and the non-UBC res listings all require a minimum 12 month lease starting September. 
I'll be doing co-op in term 2 and although I don't know where I'll end up yet, I plan on moving back home if I get a something local (I only want to live near school in term 1 because I don't want to commute 3 hours a day while taking 6-7 courses).

International student getting a car,3,7,"Hiya,

I'm from England, in my first year (just finished), and am moving off campus for next year.

I wanted to get a car, but I'm unsure of how it works (I have a full valid automatic UK license).

Year Round Housing anxiety,6,11,"Hi all. Deeply distressed first year here. Can't believe I'm still alive, to tell you the truth. Still struggling more and more everyday but one endures. Anyways, I'll cut straight to the chase.

*Some background info, don't know if it's relevant:* I've referred to that very handy YRH chances table but some further corroboration would be appreciated. I applied for YRH early to mid September-ish (it was a bad time mental-health wise hence the late application). I'm an international student on res atm. I am supposed to go back to my home country for the summer but I would like to spend May here working and go back in June. It is all dependent on YRH though. So I won't be in Canada from May to August. Haven't been able to seriously start looking for a place yet for August because I have no idea if YRH is going to work out.

**So what are my chances of getting an offer for May 1? (!!) My numbers and preferences right now are as follows --**

Thunderbird 4 -- 365

Marine 3/4 -- 815

Brock 4 -- 714

Pond 4 -- 904

Fraser Hall 6 -- 399

In addition, my roommate group of 4 was finalized rather recently (like Friday recently). Does that affect my or their chances at getting YRH? They applied around the same time I did, and their numbers are fairly similar for Thunderbird and Marine (mine might be lower though). Do we have any chance at all for getting housing together for May? By what exact date should I consider YRH a lost cause (in that no offer is received by then) and start viewing (and not just considering) off campus housing in person?

So sorry if I didn't make sense and I apologize for the English. Stressful time. Overly-caffeinated and averaging a breakdown a day. Hope your day is going well! Thank you for all and any help, immensely appreciated.",b2q9ax,UBC
Tips for How to Deal with Loneliness on Campus,19,18,"Although maybe contrary to the title, I do feel I should acknowledge that I do have friends in my program and I am grateful for them, in case they see this post and realize who I am. 

Now for the substance of the post. I am in my second year now and I have found that I am constantly trying to combat feelings of loneliness by immersing myself in my readings, webwork, studying, etc. However, it is getting me nowhere and regardless of if I am studying in a library, coffee shop, the Nest, my dorm, etc. that I continue to feel lonely. At the end of the day, even if I surround myself with other people, I am not interacting with anyone. I feel invisible on this campus. 

My friends that I mentioned before all live off campus. At the end of our classes, I can see everyone else's faces light up because they get to go home and I feel like it's some cruel joke that they can be so happy at a time that I am dreading the upcoming loneliness. The only thing keeping me going right now are the 5-7 hours of classes everyday of the week when I can feel like I am actually alive and not just some sentient, mobile computer. 

They say people whose family member have depression are more likely to have depression at some point too.

[AMA]: Riley Ty for AMS VP External and Senate,1,16,"HELLO UBC PEOPLES!

My name is Riley Ty, I am the current AMS Councillor for Science, a 4th Year Integrated Science and History student and I am running for both AMS VP External and Senator at Large. Here are links to my FB page and website if any of you are curious:

&#x200B;

Website: [www.voterileyty.com](https://www.voterileyty.com) 

Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/events/678674745868252/](https://www.facebook.com/events/678674745868252/)

&#x200B;

Below I have shown simplified versions of my platforms, for the full versions please visit my website that is listed above

&#x200B;

\- VP External Platform -

&#x200B;

1. Mental Health

To better address the Mental Health needs of the UBC community and reduce the strain on campus resources, I will seek partial subsidy for off campus services from the government. I will also like to discuss expanding the current AMS/GSS Health and Dental plan to better assist this process.

I will also reach out to fellow student unions across to country, to begin setting out common Mental Health goals we can all set to achieve to better tackle the issue rather than going piece meal. 

&#x200B;

2. Financial Security

Provincial:

\- Hold the government accountable and lobby for the promised $1000 completion grant.

\- Recommend decoupling BC student loan application and Upfront Grant application to ensure access for students choosing to fund their education through savings such as RESP instead of new student loans. 

&#x200B;

Federal:

\- Work with other students unions to begin the process of lobbying Ottawa to commit to lower federal student loan interest rate to below the Prime Rate for variable rate loans and match the Prime Rate for fixed rate loans, new and existing. Hopefully, with the introduction of Budget 2020, followed by a full elimination before Budget 2022.

\- Work with other student unions to lobby for eliminating the domestic portion of Federal Tuition Tax Credit in favour of Upfront Grants for Canadian students from below median income households, while preserving a non-transferable Federal Tuition Tax Credit for International Students.

&#x200B;

3. Transportation

\- Secure provincial and federal government promises for funding of the skytrain to UBC.

\- Research and recommend changes to the BC Passenger Transportation Amendment Act (Bill 55) to expand the limited availability of ride hailing services. 

&#x200B;

\- SENATE PLATFORM -

&#x200B;

Below are the three condensed versions of what I will focus my Senate campaign on, it is important to note that Senate runs on a three year cycle, where projects and ideas are mainly introduce in the earlier half, whereas the final stretch is about wrapping up existing projects. Currently we are entering the last year of a cycle and while the focus of my campaign will be focused on completing existing projects (i.e. Fall reading break) however, I am more than willing to have conversations with the faculty members on what I hope to see the senate tackle in future years. 

&#x200B;

1. Communication

One of the greatest and continuous issues facing the senate is lack of clarity and communication. For example, it has recently come to my attention that final examinations are only mandated for students in 1st and 2nd year and that much of UBC’s faculty are unaware of this fact. 

\- To resolve issues such as these, I think it is important the senate improve its communication by first sending out a faculty wide notice whenever a new policy is passed that impacts the populace.

\- We also need to make more effort to consult and engage the populace and faculty on the issues that directly impact them, such as surveys, classroom announcements, etc. 

&#x200B;

2. Academic Structure and Resources

\- Currently academic concession is determined by each separate faculty with no universal process for students, which causes confusion and strain on an individual during an already tense moment in their life. As such, the Senate has been focused on standardizing the process across all faculties and I want to continue said effort.

\- In addition, I want to support the push to free access Open Educational Resources (OREs), especially their usage in large sized classes as it would be more efficient than paying for an overpriced textbook that immediately goes down in value after you are done using it. Increased usage may even prompt publishers to drop their own prices to compete!

\- Lastly, I would like to push for an earlier release of the final exam schedule and later withdrawal deadlines, as the current the add or drop deadline for a W standing of 6 weeks ignores the many constraints that students face during the 6 week mark into the term

&#x200B;

3.  Future Directions

While the previously mentioned topics will be the focus of my time in Senate, I also want to discuss with the faculty members of senate what I hope to see in future years and mainly this boils down to:

\- Term limits for faculty, while Student Senators are elected on a yearly basis, faculty senators are elected every 3 years and some have even sat on the Senate for decades. I think it is important to have some measure of accountability and provide motivation for faculty to pass things faster in the senate (i.e. it works at a snail's pace) and if faculty realize their spot is not guaranteed for decades at a time, it can force them to participate more actively in the Senate.

\- In regards to fall reading break, as this debate has raged on for some time with merits on both side and years of work has culminated in essentially 1 extra day during Thanksgiving long weekend, I want to support the development of a Fall Reading Break working group that will solely focus on the merits of this case and what stance the senate would take. Of course this is dependent on if the Senate will create a working group before the end of the current academic year. 

\- Currently, some courses are structured in a way where a student can fail the course if they solely fail their final exam, regardless of their cumulative mark after the exam. I find this system greatly unfair as your grades should be a reflection of cumulative and continuous effort throughout the term. I would then like to suggest to faculty senators that this practice be abolished and that the final mark in a course is cumulatively determined.

If elected, I promise you that I will do my best to listen to the needs of students and work together with the greater student community to discover the answers to many of our shared problems.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading! 

&#x200B;

Sincerest of Regards,

Winter and YRH advice?,3,3,"I'm weighing my options for housing this coming September. I just received my Winter Housing waitlist, and it dropped about 70 spots to 2520 now with preference order of Walter Gage 6BD, Fairview Crescent 4/5/6BD, Walter Gage Apartment Studio and Rits. I wouldn't bet my chances on this, but I had a friend in her 2000s last year and got a Ponderosa Studio, which was very lucky considering.

For YRH, I am currently at 582 for Thunderbird 4BD being my first choice. Then, Brock Commons 4BD at 1204 (highly unlikely from what I've seen). Then, Marine Drive 4BD at 1402 (Maybe there's a chance, I don't know?), and lastly, Ponderosa 4BD at 1518 (also very highly unlikely).

I'm not sure if I should sign a contract for off-campus housing in April before I leave for home in the summer. But at the same time, I would prefer living on campus and see if I get offers in the summer (if I don't get any by April), and maybe find a temp housing to live in for the first week till I can find an off campus housing for real (if everything else fails).

What are some of your experiences so far on this and any suggestions of moving the preferences around? I've read some threads on Thunderbird from one or 2 years ago latest, and they've all had positive reviews because of the renovations, and not so good ones and ant infestation etc. from more than 2 years ago (I assume that was before the renovation).

Experiences managing housing and coop?,3,3,"If you've lived on campus and done coop how did you manage it? I'm thinking about applying to coop (science) but I'm worried about finding places to live over the next few years since my coop terms might interrupt housing.

A friend of mine on campus is giving his old mattress to me and I am wondering if anyone would be willing to help move it for me.  All my friends who own cars will be out of town during the winter break, so I am hoping someone can help me out in exchange for a little cash.

Reasons Why UBC's Decision to Remain Open During the Full-On Transit Strike is Dangerous and Lacks Foresight,383,82,"Like many of you I am concerned about UBC's decision to remain open during the system-wide shutdown of busses due to the transit strike on November 27th, 28th, and 29th. Similar to snow days, students will face significant challenges trying to get to campus where they need to attend lectures, exams, and labs. I don't believe this decision has been made with proper consideration and we need to make UBC listen to our concerns. Here are some of my thoughts about the matter:

1. According to UBC's 2018 Transit Status Report over 140,000 students, staff, and faculty rely on vehicles or transit to get to campus, with over half of that total arriving by transit (76,600). According to UBC Parking's website, there are over 8,300 parking spaces on campus. Students already have issues finding parking. However, with thousands more expected to drive to campus without busses available parking spaces are likely to run out quickly. ([https://planning.ubc.ca/sites/planning.ubc.ca/files/images/transportation/reports/UBC2018-TransportationStatusReport-FINAL.pdf](https://planning.ubc.ca/sites/planning.ubc.ca/files/images/transportation/reports/UBC2018-TransportationStatusReport-FINAL.pdf)) ([https://parking.ubc.ca/about-us](https://parking.ubc.ca/about-us))
2. An unknown, but likely large, amount of people who are not UBC staff/students/faculty will also be trying to get on campus. This includes construction workers, hospital staff, University Hill Secondary staff/students, Norma Rose Point School staff/students, Regent College staff/students, and employees of companies, shops, and food stalls around campus.
3. UBC's Fall 2019 Graduation takes place on those days (Nov 27-29), which means parents, friends, and families of graduates will also be trying to get to campus  ([https://graduation.ubc.ca/schedule/](https://graduation.ubc.ca/schedule/))
4. Not everyone may need a parking space as many people are likely to carpool, taxi, or be dropped off by friends, family, or strangers. However, with only 3 roads that connect UBC to the rest of the city, traffic into campus could be brought to a standstill, especially with insufficient parking space.
5. It is forecasted to snow on Nov 27-29, creating dangerous driving conditions. It only takes one accident to block up one of the five roads going into campus. In the possible event that  accidents on more than one road, inbound traffic to UBC could become halted for hours.  ([https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/14-day-weather-trend/british-columbia/vancouver?from7day=1](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/14-day-weather-trend/british-columbia/vancouver?from7day=1))
6. With the possibility of a traffic standstill or roads to UBC being blocked due to accidents, emergency services will face significant challenges trying to get to campus/where they are needed creating a dangerous safety hazard.
7. Commuter hostel rooms are likely already booked up. Without the availability of alternative accommodation options or buildings open 24hrs,  students with no other options have been suggesting pitching tents on campus. Although it is unlikely most students will do this, those that do would be putting themselves in danger of facing freezing conditions forecasted for those nights.  ([https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/14-day-weather-trend/british-columbia/vancouver?from7day=1](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/14-day-weather-trend/british-columbia/vancouver?from7day=1))
8. The Executive Director of UBC's Association of Administrative and Professional Staff at UBC has already called out UBC's failure to uphold the bare minimum in response to the job action as a responsible employer. In my opinion, the AMS should do the same in regards to the difficulties faced by the students they represent as a result of UBC's decision. ([https://aaps.ubc.ca/member/news/transit-strike-information](https://aaps.ubc.ca/member/news/transit-strike-information))
9. This decision punishes students and employees who cannot afford to drive, live close to campus, or live on campus.

EDIT: Evidently I can't count. Kinda funny what happens to the brain at the end of the term. There are indeed five roads that lead to campus. Sorry guys. Also, if it's not feasible for UBC to shut down at least some kind of support, accommodation, or plan for students and employees would be scores better than their current suggestion of carpool. Idk maybe they're just waiting to see if the shut down will actually happen. I really do hope they adjust their approach if it does.",dzpiq5,UBC
UBC HOUSING: REVENGE OF THE MEGATHREAD,27,877,"#READ THIS BEFORE YOU POST ANY QUESTIONS. ALL OF IT. I PROMISE IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES.

Any and all questions related to housing should be posted as comments in this thread.  If you're wondering about **residence, off-campus housing, commuting, or anything else related to a roof over your head**, this is the place to ask.  Other posts on these topics will be deleted.  

For everyone's sanity...

1. Please upvote people who answer your question. Posting 'thanks!' is appreciated, but upvotes help the correct answers move to the top of the thread.
2. Google your question first.  Many questions are answered simply by someone else looking your question up.  
3. Include as much information as you can in your question.  Don't tell us you're in the 700s on the waitlist: tell us you're a fourth-year student from the Interior who is at 732 to get into a four-bedroom unit in Marine.  
4. Ask a specific question.  Several specific questions are easier to answer than one general question. Easy questions get answered faster than hard ones.  
5. Many questions can only be answered by someone at UBC. If you're having any sort of a problem with a website, try a different computer.  If it doesn't work on that computer, we probably can't help.  

For anyone answering questions: please keep your answers polite and concise. Joke answers will be deleted, and repeat offenders will be banned.

How much will the winter housing waitlist drop July onwards?,7,5,"Hey all, I have a position on the winter housing waitlist at ~97 and have been there for the past 4 days (was previously at ~216) I am going into my second year so I haven’t been through this process before and would like to know how the waitlist has moved historically around this time. I’m stuck as to whether I should begin looking off campus with friends or if I should wait for an offer. Thanks!


**Update**: Today, a week after posting this, I was checking my waitlist and I was still at 97, but 5 minutes later I got an email with a housing offer for a gage studio! So my preferences may have had something to do with this waitlist delay. So if you're in a similar situation in the future know that there is hope and although your number has been stuck for a while, it likely won't be there forever. And for future winter applications if all you want is a room (any room), you're probably best off going for the shared spaces as there's more of them available and more people will be turning them down.

##**Carpool Thread**
As everyone is aware, transit workers have served 72 hour strike notice, to commence a strike starting midnight at Halloween (00:00, Nov 1).  We have asked UBC administration if there is a plan in place for this event, and last we heard, there is no plan.

We would like to urge all clubs to please help organize carpool arrangements within your clubs.  As large groups of people who presumably know each other, clubs are uniquely suited to help their members get to school if the worst happens. 

**You can use this thread to find passengers and drivers for a carpool.** Please include:

- Are you a driver or a passenger?

- A nearby community center or other public space you can get picked up/pick people at

- The time you need to get to campus by

- The general time-frame of your commute

- Other information relevant to passengers

**Be sure you get picked up/dropped off at a public location, only get picked up by people you’ve talked to in advance (preferably those who are UBC students or staff), share your travel information with friends, and always use your best judgment.**

Documenting my experience with EmpowerMe,43,11,"I thought it might be helpful for others to document my experience with EmpowerMe.

I have a long (untreated) history of anxiety and with traits of OCD. Last spring I went to Health Services (SHS) as things were getting out of hand. Long story short in the fall I was given a prescription to anti-depressants and told to visit counselling services. The intake lady at counselling services was wonderful and recommended either a group session weekly or very infrequent one-on-one appointments. Given I wanted support ASAP, I was registered to the group sessions. I have never gone due to the anxiety and me putting things off.  

It's now 4 months later I still want help and support, last week I had a completely inappropriate breakdown and realize the anti-depressent isn't going to fix things.
Yesterday I sucked up the sketchiness of EmpowerMe and phoned the toll free number. I was connected with a kind nurse who did an intake (basic things, injuring yourself? suicidal? how anxious? how depressed?) and I'm awaiting a phone call in the next few days to set up an appointment.  I'll keep people posted as there doesn't seem much info on EmpowerMe around. 

Update: 24 hrs (-ish) after contacting EmpowerMe a clinician contacted me directly to book an apt, I will be seeing her off campus later this week.  At no point have we talked money and the address I was given was to a private therapist, so I'm curious how this will go down. ",7klkqz,UBC
Did this person lie to my face or is it actually possible to do this?,10,14,"So I met someone the other day, who is a first-year international student. I asked them what courses they were taking this term and they named quite a few 200-level courses which had first year pre-reqs (like chem 233/235 , and they mentioned a few others can't remember) 

I asked them if they were able to do this because they took AP/IB credit for them but they said, it was because they finished these courses in the summer. I was confused , and thought they meant ""summer"" as in summer courses at another institution or something but then I realized they meant summer courses AT UBC. (like they took courses in the 2017 may through august summer session, before school opens in September , as a first year who received their admission to UBC in March) 

They said, being an international student they were confused when the ""actual"" school session (what we see ""winter session"" to be) started here because the school months are different in the country they were from (they had already graduated or just graduated from high school when they received uni acceptance) - and thought it was necessary to finish courses in the summer first, and then do courses in September 2017.

They also mentioned they were living off campus, and seemed to be pretty disconnected from the first year ""bubble"" which we are all used to (such as being in Rez communities, collegia, learning centres etc).

As far as I know, it is not possible to do this? or is it? When we received admission to UBC, was it not specifically for SEPTEMBER of that year??? However, I remember when I was making worklists back in the spring, you could still see courses for the summer session but I never tried to register for any of them (not sure if it would have worked)

Did this person fall for a glitch in the system, and went on to passing and receiving grades for 4/5 summer courses? It is pretty legit that they finished those courses over the summer - are they lying to me that they are in first year and got accepted in march?

* What are the starting wages like, and how much time should I plan on spending at work each week?

1. When do we start looking? My undergrad buddies all say start now but they're all living in IV, does this apply for Goleta/Downtown as well? 
2. We see some nice places that are listed right now on CL and Padmapper but they say available now. Do I contact them anyway to look for a lease starting this summer? 
3. Is it easy to sublet a spaces out around here? We might be getting internships in other places and not be around for the summer but a lot of places have 1 year leases.

I'm not sure if the person fully understood what I was asking, though. The second person told me that grants based on income (CalGrant, Pell grants, etc.) would not change when I moved off campus.

Incoming Exchange Student - Looking for advice about housing,3,8,"Hi!

I'm an Aussie exchange student coming in for the Winter & Spring Quarters, and I've been having some trouble with deciding what to do about housing.

For starters, I'm 20 (turning 21 in 2020), and I've heard that most of the residence halls are for freshman/sophomores. On the other hand, the apartments seem to be pretty far from campus and that seems a bit bothersome, as well as socially isolating. Staying in off-campus accom is also an option but I know very little about that.

So I guess my questions boil down to:

1. What do other juniors do? Do they go off campus or stay in apartments? And do people still bother socialising outside of their circles? I guess this question would be summed up as, where would I fit in best?
2. For those of you who are international, what do you do? where do you stay/who do you socialise with?
3. How well integrated is the community? Do people go into IV to party or do they stay in their areas?
4. Do people make friends through clubs or do they tend to focus on flatmates/frats etc. (speaking of frats are they a thing?)
5. Lastly, how do those of you living in apartments find the experience? Did you already have a well-built social network when you moved there? How difficult is it to get to campu?

Overall I guess my main concern is where I can go to fit into the community and integrate, rather than being isolated.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

UCSB or UCSD? In-state transfer student from SD county,0,7,"Hello Reddit world, I'm a noob here, howdy!

I am a transfer student from north San Diego county. I am really stuck between college choice - I am a San Diego native, born and raised here. I have not been around/gotten out much lately. I have been itching to get out somewhere new. I just recently was accepted to UCSB, UCSD and UCD ---> SB for electrical engineering, SD for environmental engineering, and Davis for civil - although Davis has not been very appealing to me (convince me?). While I know the date to have a decision made is coming up quickly, I just wanted to see what living situations have been like for other students who have moved up to UCSB with no financial support system...

* Should finances dictate my decision?? Unofficial financial aid has stated I could receive a lot for the 2 years I will be attending 
* How much financial aid is normally gifted to a student with low to no income parents?
* How much of this financial aid can help with on/off-campus living?

I have worked the same restaurant job and taken engineering classes (math, phys, chem) for 3 years now, so I have faith in my ability to get and maintain a job while taking tougher classes up there. 

I have been very busy with my last semester and work, however I plan on getting up to SB next week to check it out for a day or two with a friend of mine, currently taking classes at UCSB.

Also, I keep reading that the engineering program at UCSD has much more funding, and UCSB continues to be overlooked and underestimated as far as their engineering programs are concerned! Overall, I feel the decision should come down to how much I will enjoy living in either place, but I do want to hear any stories regarding how the college choice can affect career down the road. I would love to hear what any other engineering/STEM majors have in mind, any input from anyone greatly appreciated!

UCSB or CSULB,0,11,"Hey all, I'm a transfer student with a HUGE dilemma. I got into CSULB's Socioogy program and UCSB's Pre-Sociology program. I've visited both campuses and came up with a few pros and cons. 

&#x200B;

I'm a first generation college student. I come from a low income family so my financial aid packages from both schools are pretty good.  If any of you can help in anyway that'll be amazing. Thank you! 

&#x200B;

**UCSB** 

* **Pros?** Originally my first choice. Beautiful campus, scenic mountains to the left and a gorgeous beach to the right. #2 School in the Nation for Sociology. Networking will be ez pz. The essentials I'll need are all within walking distance. IV is a great small town and I can just go out on College Nights Thursdays if I'm that desperate to make friends. Some of the amenities that interested me are the free weekly groceries/toiletries you get and free printing stations around campus. There's also free Scuba lessons. They've also got a large facebook community where I can buy, sell, and ask any question. 
* **Cons?** Far away from everything. There is no IKEA and I love IKEA. Small community means not a lot of restaurant options which can be a blessing in disguise. Sh\*tty gym. I've got no friends out here so it's a complete fresh start. Majority white campus, I'm scared I'll feel out of place or less represented. 

**CSULB** 

* **Pros?** Commuting campus! Their wellness center is HUGE and offers many different fitness activities. (Something SB's Campus Gym lacks.) Their lounge has a bowling ally, pool tables, and a game room with multiple TV's and controllers. Their book store does amazon price checks. It's located in a huge city! Lots of places to keep me entertained. Full of creative people since its close to LA. Campus is much more diverse which I know is stupid but it makes me feel less anxious. I have a couple friends already going to Irvine that I can room with. 
* **Cons?** LOTS of students. I'll likely live off campus so parking is gonna suck. Streets are less safe to walk in at night vs SB.  I won't be forced into a small suburban community so I can easily get caught up in the ""city life"". A CSU degree can't compare to a UC degree.",bgabs3,UCSantaBarbara

Shared vs Single Room for Transfer Student,2,6,"Hello, I am planning to transfer to UCSB and I noticed that in there university-apartments, none of them have single occupancy.

I'm a very quiet person and extremely OCD-crazy about cleanliness and organisation. I am fine with sharing every area of the living-quarter **EXCEPT** for the sleeping area. I would like to socialise and make friends with people in clubs and community centres rather than those I live with. I have some questions about housing (for transfers, in particular):

* Are there any special circumstances I can mention that will prioritise me or allow me to get a single-occupancy room at San Clemente?
* If I have a roommate in a university-apartment, can I pick them (roommate matching), or is it all randomised?
* In the university-apartments, is there a way to request a different roommate or for me to move to a different room if I don't like him/her?

Weight lifting at campus gym?,6,3,"Hi everyone, I'm a new student transferring to UCSB for the fall quarter.

PSA/Rant: Don't use UCen Post Office,21,8,"Before you accuse me of being a shitty customer keep in mind this happened to me multiple times. Since department stores in this area don't exist and the closest Walmart/Target/anything actually useful are a 1 hour car ride away, I do most of my shopping online. Because I never know what service the site's going to use for shipping, I always put in my UCen P.O. Box address to be safe, since FedEx and UPS do deliveries the sane way and will still deliver to your front door. 

The problem is the UCen Post Office has lost 2 of my orders, and each time they've been incredibly unhelpful. I know they're at the UCen because tracking says they've been delivered. Some even go back out for delivery on a weekday because the location was closed. Only the UCen is closed on weekends, so I know for a fact they're there. The first order they lost was around $60 of stuff I needed for my dorm. The chick working the counter was rude and catty when I showed her the tracking info telling me the package was there, and just told me that I should ""Keep coming back to look."" Thing was, that was like the 5th time I came in to get my package, and since I live in off campus housing, making the treck down to the UCen everyday was a major pain in the ass. I'm a full-time student who also works part-time; I don't have time everyday to come to campus to look for a package THEY lost. I gave up and eventually just called Walmart CS, and they were incredibly helpful and refunded me for everything. I figured that maybe this was just a one time thing.

The second time they lost my package was today. I ordered a corset for medical reasons from eBay and had it delivered to the UCen. It was delivered on Mon, and since I didn't get a notification from the UCen, I assumed it was in the P.O. Box. Not there. Okay, maybe it just needs some time to process. I come back two days later. Still no notification from the UCen, so I check the P.O. Box again. Still not there. The day after that I went to the Santa Catalina package pickup point to see if maybe they sent it there without sending me a notification by accident. Nope. Not there either. I decided to swing by the P.O. Box one last time today and it still wasn't there. I asked the guy working at the counter if he could just briefly look for the package, but once again I got attitude and was told ""keep looking,"" despite me doing that almost every single day of the week.

I've already contacted the eBay seller, but I'm sick and tired of the UCen's service. I get that it's free, but people are PAYING for the stuff that gets delivered there. You can't just lose them and not attempt go look for them at all, because that's people's money you're handling. This whole situation has really pissed me off. I've already bought a P.O. Box for myself at the nearby post office in Goleta, because I'm never risking losing my packages again. I seriously suggest you guys do the same. ",8irakx,UCSantaBarbara

I was wondering if there are any book clubs here on campus, and if not, who would be down to make one in the winter quarter? It doesn’t have to be an official school organization or club either, since to my knowledge we can’t get started on that until next year (correct me if I’m wrong, I am a first-year student after all). We can vote on books to read, read a certain amount every week if we can, and discuss them on our own at some place.



I just want something more engaging and thought-provoking to partake in on campus and meet new people who I can be nerds with. :)

Advice for picking out classes,2,7,"For sure i know 2 of my classes, the third i need to have at least 12 units. I have Econ 10a, my choices are Hartman or Deschnes, My two best schedules right now with those two classes either give me Tuesdays and THursdays off or just Thursdays, which i like a lot. But those schedules have me in class from 12 until 3 or 4 (with a possible lunch break in between classes) on mondays, which i'm kinda cool with. I'm not used to taking classes this late, i've always taken 2 classes a day from about 9 until 1 or 2 pm, will it be hard to adjust to this schedule?

Is this a good idea? to have class for 3 consecutive hours from 12-3, or should i have that break and extend my time on campus until 4? How do CLAS meeting work (days per week, hours per day, and the times)?

I don't think i should take my UD writing class right now, because the one i want to take is full and requires a certain econ class and the rest don't interest me as much. What else should i take that is 3 units and less intense than my other 2 classes? can i take my UD writing class next summer? 

I also don't know whether it's smart to find a job, on or off campus, my first semester. My family's willing to help me out with food, i have the money to pay my rent and some food, but after the first quarter i probably won't have the money. I'll most likely have like 3 days a week without class, and another 2 days with just one class meeting, i feel like i should be somewhat productive for at least 5-6 hours and get paid.

For Incoming Freshmen: The Real Talk,42,22,"Let's be real here. It's awesome that people are being really nice and helping underclassmen. However, some of the information being passed around is not really useful. Here are some of the things I wish I knew, but weren't told.



* **Orientation**: No, what date you get doesn't matter for the most part. For some degree, it DOES. Spots for certain classes are reserved for each orientation. With the GE's you're signing up for, there are smaller sections that correspond. There's usually 10+ different sections so you can find one that best fits your schedule. Those are not reserved. You can get into the class, but you might not get the section time you want because it will be full. The earlier orientation times will have first choice in section times. If you have a later orientation date, you might end up with a 6pm or an 8am section that conflicts with another class.



* **Tropicana del Norte**: They are NOT a University owned building. The school is not responsible for whatever shit goes on there. They have their own dining commons but you CANNOT swipe into any on campus dining commons. You will have to pay $12. If you live in an on campus building and so does your friend, they can sleep over in your room and you in theirs. Trop is considered off-campus so you cannot stay in an on campus dorm overnight. Also, there are sometimes lock downs to make sure no non-residents get into the dorms (ie halloween, deltopia). They swipe each person individually and you will NOT be let in.

* **Off-Campus Housing**: ""start thinking early about who you would want to live with next year. Try to get a crew of 4-6 and look for houses in IV. We aimed to sign our lease a couple weeks after winter break and that was a good time as places really do start to fill up"" -reddit user Tantien. Yeah, start looking for housing beginning of winter quarter. A lot of people start signing leases as early as January and as late as March. I signed in February and ended up with my 3rd choice housing because my first two were already leased out. Housing in IV is definitely its own version of the hunger games especially with the increasing number of admits each year. Housing closer to campus tends to be more expensive. Housing is cheaper on the 67 block and in Goleta.

* **Housing**: It literally does not matter which you choose because they really all are great. There is no ""social"" or ""quiet"" dorm because it really depends on who signs up for what. Usually, the ""quieter"" dorms have rooms that are slightly further and more isolated. It really depends on you. If you really don't like your dorm, you can always move out after a quarter. (San Nic is not limited to FSSP and FSSP is not limited to San Nic during the regular school year)



* **FSSP**: It's not some special program. You're literally just taking summer session B. You're going to be in classes with upperclassmen and the rest of the school.



* **IV food**: Not the best, but not the worst. Depending on where you're from, it'll be more expensive or about the same price. Expect to pay $8 - $12 per meal.



* **Dorms**: You CAN bring an electric kettle, crockpot, coffee machine BUT you must only use it in the lounge. And hide it in your room. Your room gets cleaned weekly/ every two weeks.  The cleaners just vacuum and aren't allowed to touch anything. If you have shit laying around (coffee makers, alcohol bottles, weed) they WILL report it. Just put that in your closet because they can't open it. You can opt out to clean it, but not more than once in a row or else the cleaning people/ RA will get suspicious. Do NOT cover your fire alarm because they will find out. Don't smoke if your rooms because the smell will get everywhere. *For info of how to get away with shit* in the dorms, refer to tantien in the comments.

* **Bikes**: Don't get a beach cruiser, but if that's your only option, then get it, I guess. Nobody really cares that much and you won't be stigmatized or something because of it. Do NOT buy an expensive ass bike. It might get stolen (parts or all of it.) The salty ocean air will also make it rust faster. U locks usually work. If you're really concerned, U lock and a cable lock will do it.

I live off campus and don't really have any MSU friends,9,19,"So I'm a sophomore and during my freshman year I was eager to get out of the dorms because my sister lived off campus and it just seemed cheaper and better than living on campus. I tried to get some people to be my roommate and commit to an apartment but anyone that I would ask didn't want to commit that early on. So I got an apartment by myself. My freshman year I didn't really make a lot of attempts to make friends here because I was focused on school and I had relationships back at home (girlfriend, friends, family). I usually went back home every 2 weeks or had my girlfriend visit to stay the night every 2 weeks (regardless of what I did I got to see my girlfriend every 2 weeks). So I will say it is my fault for not making friends. But I was still content with my life.

&#x200B;

Now that I'm back at MSU and in my new apartment it feels like all I do is go to class and do homework. During the first couple months my girlfriend and I went through a rough patch after she moved into college (GVSU) so at times I felt really alone and really didn't have anyone around for support (luckily the rough patch is over but it still gets lonely out here sometimes). I have a lot of hard classes this semester (CSE 231, MTH 234, and CE 221) so I felt like I couldn't get a job or join a club. I did try to look into different clubs and actually go to some at the beginning but I was either uninterested, too busy with school, or too busy with going home or seeing my girlfriend. I feel like at this point in the semester it's too late to join a club or make new friends. I will say I have some acquaintances that keep me from being a total loner in class but I don't really have a friend group that I have to have fun with on the weekends I'm not going someplace or having my girlfriend over. I feel like my classes right now are messing with me the most because CSE takes up your entire life during the end of the weekdays and your entire weekend. Also calc and statics just add on to the workload. 

&#x200B;

I will try to next semester hang out with my acquaintances but living off campus means that it's a little hike to get to them or have them get to you and I don't know if they'll go through the effort of hanging out at my place. I don't live that far off campus but it's still a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest free bus stop. I will also try to get into a club but the only club that really interested me was the Smash Bros. Ultimate club and I am a total noob at the game and just get squashed. I don't dislike the club but I feel like they weren't very truthful when they said its a club for beginners to advanced. It feels like everyone there is a pro and I just get destroyed. I just don't know how to make friends. I'm not really one to go to parties but I'm not opposed to just hanging out with a group of people just chatting or playing video games. I tried researching clubs here on a website but nothing really excites me or makes me eager to go to them. I feel like when they say stuff along the lines of ""college is the best years of your life,"" it just doesn't apply to me or that they're already passing by. I'm jealous of my friends that are still back home and my girlfriend for making friends so easily. I hope things will turn around next semester but can anyone relate to me or give me advice?",du7x4c,msu

I'll likely be home/using the internet a ton, I'm constantly* on Skype calls so I'd rather not have a data cap if that's possible.  I also like gaming (League, CS:GO, etc.).

I was thinking Spartan Net since there's no longer any Lightspeed. Does anyone know if they have a data cap if you use them for off-campus internet? Any problems or concerns I should know about if I go with them?  I was also wondering what router/modem I should buy if I use Spartan Net.

Any related suggestions or information would be greatly appreciated!",cjcczt,msu

Incoming Student for Off-Campus Housing,4,2,"Hi friends,

I'm taking a look for a 1 bedroom apartment.  I'm don't mind paying a premium for a nicer place with good convenience (near groceries, etc.), some quiet and good internet.  I'd consider the new condos like the Hub but I'd rather not live in a studio.  I also do not want roommates.

I was taking a look at Midtown Apartments, Skyvue or Oakridge Apartments.  Does anyone have any opinions/stories/info on any or all of these 3 places?  

Here's some info I already have just from my own research:

Skyvue: newer, spacious, fully furnished, laundry in unit

Midtown: newer, non-furnished*, quiet, more utility costs, laundry in unit

Oakridge: the website makes them look good (https://www.liveoakridgeapartments.com/) but I can't find any reviews

It was harder to find information on Midtown/Oakridge in particular.

Any information or opinions about these 3 places or a similar place that fits what I'm looking for is greatly appreciated.  Thank you all in advance!",bgkweh,msu
Important FYI for people living off campus regarding overnight parking!!!,63,7,"I didn’t know this until the very end of my junior year (boooo) but you can park on almost any street overnight any time as long as you call into east Lansing police department and register your car. They will ask your name, number, license plate, and place where your car is parked. It’s completely free, only takes a few minutes and saves a lot of headache when your driveway is super small! 

Hope this helps out some people since I definitely could have used this information earlier in my college career! ",a6whwh,msu

Timetable for Off-Campus Housing? (& 1855 Place Questions),2,4,"So I just got off the phone with the MSU Live-On people because I had some questions about living in 1855 Place next year for my sophomore year. I was told that I had to wait until mid-November and then choose an apartment in 1855 once it was my turn to choose an apartment (similar to the on-campus housing process where you had to wait until your assigned date and time). I then asked ""What happens if you don't get an apartment in 1855 Place bc they're are filled up or something? Wouldn't mid-November be too late to live somewhere else too?"" And the lady said that it won't be a problem as most people can't sign leases until November anyway. 

Is that true? Would it actually be a non-issue if I don't have a lease by mid-November if 1855 falls through?

Also, I'm trying to live with 3 other roommates that I know. For someone that chose 1855 this year, would it be really hard for me to sign up for a 4 bedroom apartment with another 3 people for since I'm a freshman and have final dibs? Like would a bunch of people just have chosen 4bdrm without filling up all the slots in that apartment? (basically, would there just be a bunch of 4bdrm available with only 1 or 2 bedrooms open per apartment, forcing us 4 to split up just bc upperclassmen may have chosen 4bdrm without having 3 other roommates to live with?) Or does that stuff not happen and I'm just overthinking it lol?

For off-campus people moving to East Lansing this fall regarding DTN,16,26,"Recently, DTN came into my apartment without making an attempt at a warning or notice while my room mate was in the shower. DTN inspected the apartment and eventually they made her get out of the shower and walk around in a towel while they inspected the bathroom. Although DTN is legally allowed to do this (it says so in the lease) it's extremely unprofessional. I felt like they treated us like property that they can just shove around at their desire. Even if I was legally allowed to I wouldn't go into someone's home and walk around, while they're there, without telling them until I kicked them out of the bathroom. A home is a private place and DTN took that away from us. A simple phone call would take a minute to make and DTN just didn't care to try.

Also, I've had nothing but infuriating problems with maintenance which has lead me to live with the problems in my apartment instead of dealing with the hassle they provide.

Where to get College of Engineering (and other college) apparel?,9,9,"I (last minute of course) have gone through every single bookstore, apparel store, you name it - both on and off campus. Literally the best thing that is available if at all is a crummy T-shirt that says “Michigan State (Engineering, Vet Med, Social Science, etc)” on the bottom. Not a tasteful gift at all imho

I have been trying since two weeks ago to and will keep trying to reach out to the official shop.msu,edu online store because they have a sweet hoodie that they used to sell with MSU engineering embroidered. 

I frankly don’t even need something that nice, but the fact that the only college that has more than block text in college font on a fruit of the loom t-shirt is the Law college. 

Can someone tell me where I can get a decent shirt or sweatshirt with a specific college printed on it? I went to UGP and it’s ~$62 to get - your own design - on a Champion hoodie. It’s not bad, but it’s not all that great for having to design something yourself and wait a minimum of 2 weeks for them to digitally print it on. I suppose it could be a licensing issue preventing a lot of companies/stores from making relatively compelling college apparel, but there has to be somewhere that they are selling this stuff! 

Feel free and suggest somewhere but chances are I have walked into the store already in the past two weeks, unless it is not right on campus/grand river. I hope this helps someone else get a (better than average) father’s day gift too

However, as someone planning to graduate in May 2020, I only have a total of six classes I was planning to take next year; totaling about 18 credits or maybe even less. So for my senior year, I was planning on taking 12 credits (filling it out with courses for fun) so I could stay full time. However, now I would be wasting money on credits I’m paying for but not using.

I only receive the Michigan Competitive scholarship and basic government loans, I live in an apartment off campus, and I work a couple campus jobs. Is there any drawback to going part time for just one semester? It would probably work out as taking 15 credits in the fall and 9 in the spring.

Do dining hall passes remain active after graduation?,2,2,"I still have like 40 off-campus meal passes and it’s not looking like I’m gonna be able to use them all before I graduate.

The website says:

“Off-campus plans remain active for students as long as you have your ID card and keep the plan active by using at least one meal in a one-year academic cycle from July 1-June 30. Dining plans not used during this time frame will be deactivated.”

It says it remains active for “students” with an ID, but if I keep my ID after I graduate will I still be able to use it, or will my ID deactivate?

Live at home or on campus?,4,8,"\*\*\*\*Live at home or off campus but in EL 

Hi r/msu! I'm going to be a senior in spring. I've lived on and off at home and in apartments since I transferred to MSU a few years ago. My parents' place is only 15 miles from school, so it never made sense for me to spend $500/month to live a little closer.

Unfortunately my car broke down last winter and I can't get a car again until next fall. My choice seems to be getting rides to school with my mom or finding last minute accommodation for spring and hopefully getting a car for next year. Honestly I've just been getting rides the last few weeks. It's kind of humiliating but works, but I don't know if I can deal with it next semester due to my schedule (mom goes to work at 6am, comes home 6-7pm when most of my classes are done at 2pm).

I don't really know what to do. In my culture and family, living at home for somebody my age (early or mid twenties) is completely acceptable. I would actually prefer to stay at home, even though I pay all my own bills. At the same time, I can probably offset most of the ""Losses"" of living near school by working part time (I already have one part time job that pays $1,000 per month, it is bascialyl pasive income and requires very little time commitment) + financial aid.

What would you do? I have lived on my own before and do not care about ""independence."" My priority is having money so I can live comfortably, travel, etc but I also don't want to spend most of my semester sitting in the library waiting to go home when i am as old as i am",9vzkjs,msu

Moped Parking in East Lansing and Lansing,7,11,"I am looking into purchasing a moped in the next few days and I was hoping some of you could me with clarifying some of the rules around mopeds.

I am aware of the new [parking regulations](https://statenews.com/article/2018/03/moped-registration-and-parking-update) on campus, but I am wondering what the rules are around parking mopeds off campus in East Lansing and Lansing.

Are mopeds supposed to park at bike racks or should they be parking in regular parking spots when off campus? For example, if I was to go watch a football game at the high school, should I take up a space in the parking lot or park at the bike rack?

I work in downtown Lansing, which is my main motivation for getting the moped (it was a long bike ride), so I was wondering if anyone has any experience parking a moped around the Capitol Complex. I am assuming that the visitor lots ($1/hour) would be the cheapest if I am supposed to have a regular parking space, but I am open to suggestions, especially if that isn't the case.

Also, any advice about mopeds in general would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

&nbsp;

Edit: I'd like to throw in that I am looking for what moped operators are actually supposed to do, not necessarily what they do and assume is following the rules.

&nbsp;

Edit 2: I have found the answers to my questions, so I will put the answers below.

/u/PrettyFarAwayNow linked the City of East Lansing’s parking regulations for those who are curious, and Lansing has similar regulations according to the DTMB. The DTMB sent me a map of the bike racks in downtown Lansing. Mopeds can be parked at bike racks (as long as they are walked along the sidewalks).

Off campus housing** LA SCALA,20,12,"Moving off-campus close to UCSD and finally thought that got a space in La Scala Opera for $2560. 

Me and my 3 apartment mates were happy that we were able to find such a cheap place.

But when we were ready to sign the lease, the women (Rita) we were calling was very rude. Not only did she talk to me in a rude way, she gave me the wrong information about the rent and fees. The conversation was consisted of:

&#x200B;

""Are you sure you want to sign the lease because I have a list of numbers I can call and they will take it""

""Are you students? Do you have enough income?"" and when we said that we were part time workers she just said ""Yea, but do you still receive 2 times amount of the rent""

""If you're not serious, I don't want to waste your time"" (WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!)

&#x200B;

We later on, called the manager and talked to her about how we were unsatisfied with her employees attitude. Although she apologized for her actions, she proceeded to be rude and disrespectful. 

&#x200B;

So dear La Scala, please fix your shitty management and stop being rude to your customers... 

You are definitely off our list...",bre26y,ucsd
Moving Off campus? Read this.,134,25,"So you're thinking of moving off campus. Well that's great! You'll save a lot of money...but how do you go about it? Id like to start chronologically. 

1. LOOK FOR A PLACE NOW or as soon as you can. This is ESPECIALLY true if you're moving off campus with a group of people or are looking for an entire apartment or townhouse, you should be searching as soon as possible.

**Where to look?**
Check out UCSD Facebook pages such as ""UCSD free and for sale 2.0"" and ""UCSD student off-campus housing"". Apartment complex websites often put out what their leasing rates are and whether or not they have/will have open spots. If their websites don't provide this info, stop by or call their leasing offices. Lastly, other websites such as Craigslist and other free and for sale Facebook groups are good places to check out as well.

**What places to look at?**
There are a few major hubs where students live around la jolla. To my knowledge, these include - Scala Apartments, Regent Apartments, La Jolla Village townhouses, Solazzo Apartments, and Costa Verde. There are MORE, but these are the ones I've either personally checked out or have friends living at. One suggestion is that I advise for you to look for places close-ish to the UCSD Superloop, which is a bus loop that goes around UCSD and many of the places I listed above. The Superloop will you save you so time, remove the NEED of a car (although it'll still be nice to have), and make it overall easier to get around town.


2. Now that you've found a handful of places you like, check your FINANCES. The great thing about living off campus is that is almost ALWAYS cheaper than living on campus.  

**Will my financial aid decrease?** 
No, it will not decrease based off of the fact that you are living off campus unless you put that you are commuting on your financial aid forms, which is DIFFERENT than living off campus. Financial aid considers commuting, as commuting from home-home/family, which will then result in less financial aid, because they believe you are living rent-free with family. 

**How will financial aid work/be distributed?**
Any grants, scholarships, or financial aid in general that was being used to pay for on-campus room and board will be given to you for the use of paying rent. This might be a little confusing depending on your EFC and other financial aid factors, so I would recommend speaking with our financial aid office to get a better idea. I will take this time to say that is in YOUR best interest to sign up for the schools financial aid direct deposit. 


3. **You found a place you like/can afford, now what?**
Speak with the landlord/leaser regarding the specifics of any agreement, this can range tremendously from place to place and person to person. For example, You can lease an entire apartment from say Costa Verde and you and your friends will have to do all the paperwork and go about it very official like. On the other hand, you can essentially sublease one room for a year from someone who is leasing and have to do little to no paperwork. What I'm trying to get at, is that this part of the off-campus housing venture varies tremendously. 

**What does this lease entail/ What do I need to watch out for?** 
As commenter u/mmabpa said, our UCSD Student Legal Services, found on the 5th floor of the SSB and available through appointments, is an excellent and free place where you can get legal aid and opinions and guidance regarding the specifics of your lease agreements.  

**What if I am going to be subleasing/What if the landlord doesn't have a lease?** 
In this scenario, it is up to you and how comfortable you are with the person you will be paying rent to. I suggest taking any and all details to SLS and explaining to them your situation. 

**How long should I lease for? 9months? A year?** 
Depends on how long you are going to stay in SD/La Jolla. If you plan on staying through the summer, a year-long lease is best, although if you don't plan on staying that long, but the place you're looking at ONLY has year-long leases, you can sublease, which is often a little annoying, but gives you the freedom to not be chained to your lease. 
The opposite is true for a 9-month lease if you don't plan on staying for the summer and don't want to sublease, do this instead. Although a 9 month/school year lease is not as widely available. 

Thats the basic timeline I went through when transitionning from on campus to off campus, I hope it helps. 

Tips & Tricks:

Large houses with many rooms obviously bring down the individual cost of rent. Thanks, u/mostlowkey1 for bringing this up. 

It is a lot easier to find a place for one person, so you have some leeway in terms of looking for places, but I would recommend not slacking. 

If you like parties, smoking, playing music real loud, avoid apartment structures and opt for townhouses or condos instead.
 
Always make sure you spend some time with any potential new roommates before solidifying your choice.

Financial aspect of moving off campus,11,15,"Hey y'all, I was hoping to get some advice about moving off campus, specifially the financial aspect of it. So for starters the way on campus living works to my knowledge is, it's pretty much included in your financial aid and is payed for with that, plus loans. 

So if I move campus would my financial aid money decrease, further more. Say housing on campus costs 10k per year, and off campus living would cost me 5k per year, but my financial aid only decreases by say 3-5k, would I get that extra 5-7k back in reimbursement that I could use towards paying off my rent, or would I have to get a job to cover the month to month cost of renting.

strange favor: I am searching for information from a particular journal in the science library. I am off campus.,12,12,"Hello, I understand that this is kind of strange, but I am a student at another university in the US. I'm looking for information or a picture from a particular scientific journal, Malayan Forest Records. UGA's science library happens to have a copy.

For those of you who might be interested in helping a stranger with a strange request, I would appreciate it if someone could head to the library and find the journal. Specifics, including the journal title and calling number in the UGA library, are detailed [here](https://gil.uga.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?SAB1=ocm01607553&BOOL1=all+of+these&FLD1=Keyword+Anywhere+%28GKEY%29&GRP1=AND+with+next+set&SAB2=&BOOL2=all+of+these&FLD2=Keyword+Anywhere+%28GKEY%29&GRP2=AND+with+next+set&SAB3=&BOOL3=all+of+these&FLD3=Keyword+Anywhere+%28GKEY%29&PID=xotPU88Qg0dNu3GeDyxSpfeYow0b&SEQ=20161116145435&CNT=50&HIST=1).

I really only need to be able to identify a particular plant. Most sources mix this species up with several others, and the author of the article I'm looking for specializes in palms of the particular region. I'd really only need someone to flip through the journal and PM me some info or pictures from the 2 page article I'm looking for.

EDIT: Since I'll be unable to respond to PMs for a while, I've decided to put some more details down in case any generous soul wants to humor me. The call number of the journal is SD97 .M3 A33; the journal should be on the 4th floor of the science library, and I am looking for a physical description or photograph of the species _Daemonorops draco_. If this information is available, it should be in volume 29 of the journal, in an article titled ""A manual of the rattans of the Malay Peninsula,"" by John Dransfield.

Feel out of place as a poorer UGA student; do people judge others’ finances?,60,26,"As I’ve been living off campus longer, I’ve been realizing a bit more the pretty stark difference between my financial situation and that of a lot of my peers. Most of everyone at least has their parents pay some rent, bought their car etc. Meanwhile, I’m living off loans and my parents don’t help for shit. They can’t help for shit. I drive a vehicle from 2007. It’s honestly difficult to not feel judged when I live in a $400/month quality apartment and my friends are living downtown and driving new cars. I don’t mean to sound complainy, it just makes me worry people think things about me behind my back. Are UGA students judgmental in this regard or does everyone truly not give a shit?

EDIT: thanks for all the responses. Also wanted to clarify that I asked this question because I was curious about a general, often-observed sentiment, and not that I actually believe all UGA students are one and the same. I hoped that would be a bit more obvious than maybe it was.",crlyxm,UGA

How to Be Better Friends with Roommate?,15,12,"Hi! I moved into a house off-campus with a sophomore, and we will have another sophomore roommate who's moving in this upcoming week.  


Thing is, to my knowledge we're both a bit socially awkward (at least, I know that I am) and so the most we really say to eachother is an awkward exchange of ""hey""s when we see eachother.   


I kinda wanna change this. Not only to make things easier and less awkward such as explaining who should take the trash out and when, when cleaning should be done and bills paid etc. (because lately I've been doing all of it but then again I haven't said anything otherwise), and like discussing whether we should just buy staples like bread, milk, and cheese together instead of on our own and stuff, but like also... I kinda just wanna be friends? Like I think it'd be cool to have a friend.

1. What is the roommate selection process like? My mom gets all excited about this and calls it roommate tinder, lol. Is it actually a system where you get to pick, ask people about themselves, strike up a relationship, etc. or is it just getting matched up with someone?

2. What are the odds of getting into one of my top three building choices? So... I'm really not very smart, and I waited until... last week or so to actually register for housing... so I'm behind all the EA people but ahead of the RD people. Do I still have a shot to get into one of my top three? For reference, I believe I picked Reed, Rutherford, and Building 1516.

3 of my closest friends and a lot of other people from my graduating class are going to be living in ECV next year. We all had this idea that we would share one of the 4-person suites, and live like a family.

However, my classes are mostly North campus. I also do not have a car, and plan to be involved with a lot of clubs next year(and don't want to be stranded at night, or have to regularly rely on people). I decided that it might be a good idea to look into Reed, though the social scene atmosphere seems pretty abysmal(I also found another friend to live with though, if I do decided to go Reed).

The latter choice gives me a lot of anxiety because I do not want to be cut off from my friends. However, choosing ECV might not make it worth it to pay so much for the ""convenience"" of living on campus, as I would be far away from a lot of the facilities that I frequent on North Campus(all of my classes, library, MLC, Tate, etc.)

Off-campus housing advice,2,2,"Hey guys. I'm going to be a sophomore next year and I'm considering moving out from my parents and living closer to campus, but I don't know what I should do as far as housing. I am not entirely familiar with the options available.

So far I have only looked at apartments because I want to live somewhere with a lot of people and events to force me to get out of my shell. I want to live within a few miles of campus for an easy commute and for the ""college experience,"" which I didn't really have my first year. 

I understand that the student-targeted apartments have a lot of problems and that there are cheaper options, but I feel like since I didn't live on campus my first year I really missed out on the experience of living with other students. I see this as an opportunity to meet people and feel like I'm ""a part of something,"" if that makes sense.

I'm not opposed to the idea of renting a house or townhouse with other people, but I think that would take away some of the social aspects of living in an apartment complex. Also, I don't know anyone who I could live with.

As far as apartments, I think I've narrowed it down to Boulevard 1900, 922 Place, or Tempe Metro. I like the idea of having access to all the amenities, but my biggest concerns are
- smoking: do many people smoke, is the smell prevalent in the apartment, and does the management do anything about it? Cigarette smoke *really* bothers me, so this is a deal breaker.
- overall environment: are people generally polite and friendly; is the building kept clean; is it run well?
- noise: how bad is it? I'm fine with parties as long as it's not every night.

Any and all advice is appreciated, whether its personal experiences with apartments or suggestions for other options like finding a house close to campus. I just feel kind of stuck living at home and I don't want to miss out on what are supposed to be the best years of my life. Thanks.",6hwi1z,asu

Will moving off campus affect my financial aid loans?,1,6,"Hi guys. I'm an out of state student on the downtown campus, and I have a pressing question for you guys that urgently needs to be answered. I want to know if my loans that I get from ASU/the federal government (Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan and Parent PLUS Loan) will be affected if I move off campus.
I have my eyes on an apartment that I would be able to afford if I get the amount of money I usually get (Parent Loan = $9,340/semester, Direct Loans = $3,500/semester, Scholarship = $5,250/semester). However, I've been living at the Downtown Phoenix dorm for the past two years.
My main concern is if moving off campus would make ASU give me less money, since the dorm/meal plan would no longer be on all of my charges. Would ASU give me just enough money to pay for all of my fees minus the dorm (small refund check), or would I get all of the money that I normally do, just in a large refund check (about $6,000 or so, with tuition taken out) when the financial aid disburses?

Commuting vs. off-campus housing for second-year student?,1,2,"Hi all, 

So I am currently a freshman living on campus at ASU.

However, the cost is way too much and I will not be able to do it next year. Now, I have two options for next year:

1. Commute to Tempe from the West campus (I live approximately 10-15 minutes away) EDIT: via the ASU shuttle

2. Rent a house or an apartment near the Tempe campus with 2-3 other friends. 

I would like to get some insight from you guys, especially if you commute or live off-campus. Is living off-campus a lot different than living on-campus? Is it really worth it to rent out an apartment when I can just commute and save money? ",2qosjy,asu

"Is it normal for a college student to go a couple of days literally without any sleep per week, just to catch up on his/her classes and not fall behind?",59,49,"I'm currently put in a situation where time management is a huge hassle for me because I work at a job(off-campus) for more than 25 hours per week, and take 13 credit hours this semester(5 courses), which probably sounds like nothing to some college students but it is for someone like myself who works off campus for that many hours per week. Right now, I did an all-nighter after drinking a 5-hour energy drink so I can finish off as much HW assignments from all of my classes as much as I can while trying to review and prepare for a Midterm Exam that is today.

Before you go and make assumptions that the only reason why I'm behind is because I procrastinate too much, that's not really always the case with me. As soon as I get off from work at around 10AM, I head straight to ASU campus for my classes and then stay in for most of the days(to get as much work done on my assignments as I possibly can, even if I don't complete all or any of them). By the time I come back home from school very late at night, I would try to finish the rest of the HWs but get too burnt out from the day and then crash into bed.

It seems like the only way I can catch up with all my classes is to do many all-nighters and sacrifice my break from my weekends.

I’m tired of not feeling safe off campus. [Rant],256,50,"I like going to UW. I like my classes, my major, my professors, etc. But I HATE going off campus.

Yesterday, on my way back from Trader Joe’s a homeless man high off who knows what, masterbated  in front of me.....at 9AM. A few weeks ago there were stabbings on the Ave. Before that, my friend got a knife pulled on him while walking home. Last year, one of my closest friends (an extremely fit/strong man) was jumped and beaten up pretty bad. When I hold my girlfriends hand in public (off campus) often we get catcalled, asked to kiss, people touch themselves...(we’re lesbians). 

I’m tired of clutching my pepper spray every time I walk on the Ave or anywhere in the U-District. I’m tired of feeling scared when my friends or loved ones go out late at night. I’m tired of not feeling safe.

I’m from another major city, and our homeless population and crime was no where near this prominent. As a naive freshmen, I desperately wanted to move to Seattle after graduation. Now that I’m in my junior year of college, I no longer hold this idea close to me.

I know I may sound like a brat or ignorant to the fact that this happens in other cities. But I’m overwhelmed and tired and scared to go out. I’m sure some other people here feel this way.

If you’re an incoming student, I’m sorry to say that this is a part of UW and the U-District no one warned me about. So they probably didn’t warn you.

Is off campus housing really cheaper than on campus housing?,14,17,"I'm currently living in a dorm and am not so fond of it so I have been trying to look at off campus choices. I haven't really made any real friends so far at my time at UW so I've mainly been looking for single apartments or trying to find a place through the UW housing FB page.

Additionally, is off campus housing really less expensive than on campus housing? Not including the dining plan, I'm paying ~$700 a month for 9 months of housing. So I feel that unless I am able to get a place for less than $700 a month and am able to get a person sublet for the Summer or a 9 month lease (as many of the places have 12 month leases I've found), I feel that I'm not that much better off choosing an off campus choice.

When to look for off campus housing in the U-District,1,0,"Hello,

I will be attending a graduate program at UW this fall. I have been looking for apartments in the U-District, as well as other areas, but have not found many places preleasing for September. Where I was an undergrad, it was normal to lease an apartment 6-8 months before the actual start date of the lease.

I know these questions must be repetitive but I cannot find an answer anywhere online. If I visit Seattle around August 10th, can I expect to see more apartments available for lease in September? or do most landlord attempt to prelease their units?


Also, I've been looking at apartments near the Burke Gilman Trail and U-Village. Do many graduate students live in this area? Or should I look more at Capital Hill or Ravenna?

On-Campus vs Off-Campus Apartments,2,7,"I'm absolutely sick of commuting.

I haven't met anyone I'd like to room with, so I'm considering just applying for an on-campus apartment like Steven's Court and hoping my roommates are cool. The downside is that I'm (maybe?) overpaying for a place to live at $838 a month. I'd also like my living situation to provide opportunity for being social, so I'd think that an on-campus apartment would be more conductive to that rather than an off-campus apartment.

Other downsides seem to be that the on-campus apartments are fully furnished? It'd be nice to bring in my own bigger desk and bed, not sure if it will be allowed. And only one bathroom per 4 people?

We'd like to live off-campus next year to save money and have more freedom (notably, HFS isn't great in terms of options for male-female combinations of rooming situations), but have hit a bit of a snag. Her parents aren't super into the idea of her just moving into an apartment with her college boyfriend, which is totally understandable.  
The best way to fix this issue would be to room with another couple in a two-bedroom apartment next year, that way, we could simply say that boys lived in one room and girls in another, and whenever they visit, put on a show.

The other tow people (male and a female) could be another couple, a brother and sister comfortable sharing a room together, or perhaps a pair of close male and female friends. The reason we can't have a male-male of female-female pair of roommates is because then her parents would question why either *she* is living with a man, or *I* am living with a woman.

If anyone here is interested, or if anyone knows someone who would be, please comment or send me a PM.

Seeking roommate to share off campus apartment at AVA apartments for summer term and/or next school year.,1,0,"Two of my friends (male) and I (female) are going to live together in an apartment at AVA Apartments next school year.  The unit we have is 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, and it’s ADA approved (for people with a disability) so it is /very/ spacious. (None of us are disabled, it just happened to be available). It’s on the third floor, and if you haven’t checked out AVA it’s in a great spot, short walk from campus, near the Ave and various grocery stores and restaurants. 
Two of us will live there over the summer, but the other is employed in Renton over the summer and so won't be living with us during the weekdays or paying full rent over the summer. Needless to say, that leaves us with a lot of extra space and a lot of cost for just us two! We are looking for a roommate to share the apartment with us over the summer, and I am looking for a roommate to share my room (females only please) during the year—or summer and year if you like. 
Rent is $2360 per unit per month, which is generous for the space each person would get, and utilities are dirt cheap. This would be mostly split up evenly amongst all residents. Our prospective move-in date is on the 13th of June, and our roommate comes back at the beginning of September, so if you live in the boy’s room you should vacate by September first. 
Please contact me immediately if interested so we can discuss this with the other roommates and add you to the lease.

HFS pet policy,0,6,"I'm a prospective transfer student looking to start at the UW winter quarter. My plan is to live on campus at least at first for a couple reasons, but there's one huge complication: my cat! 

She's 9 years old and very precious to me. I tried to go through the ESA route, but policy reasons are a roadblock to this (I get my mental health care through my current CC medical center. They do not make diagnosises and UW wants details like that). I have thought about leaving her with a trusted friend until I can get my paperwork in order, but that is my absolute last resort. 

I have heard there is an apartment complex on campus that allows students keep animals. I believe it's Steven's Court? Please correct me if I'm wrong!

Are you ok Hun, haven't heard from you in a while? Sorry for my lack of feedback yesterday: due to your closures on Fridays I've been forced to eat off campus every Friday.

Today I got the vegetarian option, and made full use of the weird optional extra to the side. It was pretty tolerable, I might even order it by choice again (though with your lack of variety it's almost inevitable).

It was $5.99 and I got a good sized plate. Though I did have to get a second glass of water due to the heat, so probably another case of the shits: but needs must.

I think that this kind of meal should be the standard, $7.99 for the meat option is way too much for a daily meal inforced by diktat.

A Question About Late Night Visitor Parking at Padelford,1,3,"Hello, this pertains to Padelford primarily, but if you could recommend me somewhere else to park, either on or off campus, then I'd greatly appreciate it.

So it's summer break, but I'm driving up to Seattle at the end of the month on a Monday morning. I'd like to park my car somewhere and use public transport for the day because my experiences driving in Seattle haven't been very good.

I'm most comfortable with the lower level of the Padelford garage (N21, I believe). I would need to be parked until about 9:30 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. or so. However, from what I can find out online, it seems the garage (or is it the toll booth?) closes at 9:00 P.M. Does this just mean that tickets can't be purchased after 9:00? Does it mean that I can't drive out if I leave my car parked there past closing? Would I even be able to get out of campus? Will I get fined? Any elaboration would be appreciated.

If I can't leave my car parked there after 9:00, where could I find a safe alternative?

(Possible) Scam Job Opportunity. Where would I report Something Like This?,25,12,"So, I received an e-mail on the 28th and 3 AM that was sent to about 50 other people. It had to do with being a personal assistant for a professor. The e-mail had two sections, I will only post parts of the second just to make sure that, if this is a real thing, I will do very little defamation.




""This job requirements were as follows:
You have been selected to work with me through the  USA Universities, HR department as my PA while I attend to a [Place they are going to] You will only Mail letters, Reply emails and run errands on my behalf at $620/wk. I will meet you on campus upon my arrival by the last week of October for one on one interview and possibilities of making it a long term employment if you impress me while I am away. 

To apply for this position,  send your Full Name,Address, E-mail, Alternate E-mail and Mobile to [Email that I was supposed to message]  
 Note: I will communicate via email frequently and you must be able to check your emails every 10 minutes for important employment update or tasks.""








Now, I was interested, but I was wary because the first red flag is the salary that I would receive if I did this job. If the job is 20 hours a week, that is nearly double Seattle minimum wage, and if it was 30 hours a week, it is still 6 dollars more than the minimum wage. But since I care not too much about my name and mailing address or phone number for that matter, there's reasons for this. I decided, why not.

Anyway, I start receiving the first texts on the 29th in the afternoon. That's when the next red flag showed up, they said they responded to my e-mail. Well, I did not receive any e-mails from them and I double checked I sent the right e-mail addresses. When I kindly asked them to resend it, they asked me to resend my e-mail through text. I complied as it was a simple copy and paste, but when they responded to my questions, they didn't answer my question if the errands are off campus.

Okay, maybe this person is quirky. I previously looked them up, for the most part, the name that was given is a real person, but how do I know if it's the real deal. So I continue to ask questions, they keep treating me as if I am the one who will be the PA and wants me to work ASAP if I accept.
That was the third red flag for me, well. I responded politely, and asked some of my same questions again. Again, they ignore the question about the errands.

Fourth red flag to me was all these buzzwords they were using and they weren't asking for my past job experiences or anything. I haven't really had many jobs in the past, but that doesn't matter.

Fifth was when I asked my final questions, specifically, I asked if I will be receiving a document for me to sign confirming this employer/employee relationship. I am not going to agree to anything without documentation, especially when my gut is telling me somethings wrong.

The sixth was they didn't respond for a full 24 hours until this morning they texted me again and when they asked how I was doing, and I respond ""I'm doing alright, have quite a bit of school work today, how about you?""
They completely ignore my question about themselves and continue onto the 7th red flag

they *answered* my last set of questions but, again, like the errands question, ignored the paperwork question and only answered a question that I asked about how the bill paying will work.

and the 8th red flag is that their trip isn't going to end until late November instead of late October to meet with them because of circumstances. I understand stuff can happen, but with all the previous situations that happened, I'm counting this as a flag as well.

Finally, the 9th flag is not responding to my second question about paperwork. They went completely silent, before, during this morning, they were responding to my messages within 30 seconds to 2 minutes; but right after I asked about the paperwork again, they went completely silent, this was about 4 hours ago.


TL;DR: Lots of red flags from this e-mail I got and while discussing with the supposed employer. Where would I report this if this is true? Anyone have encountered situations like this before? advice?


Thank you all for reading, I apologize for the long post, I'm just a bit paranoid about this situation and don't want to fall into a trap.

On-campus housing for freshmen? (engineering dept.),2,8,"I am a prospective in-state student to UW.

Also, are there any opportunities to apply for/get scholarships as an undergrad? (I'm admitted to the Foster school, so if you know anything about department stuff)

UW Tacoma Computer Science,32,29,"Hello everyone! This sub is mostly for UW Seattle content, and I often contribute to memes or stories or whatever about UW Seattle because I was a student there for a few years. But I'm currently at UW Tacoma for computer science and I often get asked tons of questions about UW Tacoma and their CS program in particular because there is no real mention of UW Tacoma online! So with this post I just thought I'd share my thoughts. 

**TL;DR:** Go to UW Seattle for Computer Science unless you are incredibly ambitious and able to take *full* advantage of UW Tacoma's resources. Also I'm bolding some words if you want to scan the concepts. 

UW Tacoma has some really great aspects and some really terrible aspects, the CS department in particular is no exception!

PROS:

* **Small class sizes**. Every class is about 30 people save 1 or 2 senior level requirements which can go up to 60-70. You work directly with your instructor in each class session, and if you ever have questions you're expected to be able to reach them at any time for whatever help. 

* A few very **good professors**. There are several specific faculty members at UW Tacoma that are an absolute joy to take a class from; they teach their material extraordinarily well while keeping nearly all students willingly engaged in each lecture. There are about 3-4 that I wish could teach classes to the whole world because of their teaching ability. 

* The school is **built for commuters**, so you can easily schedule your classes such that you only have T/Th days on campus or M/W(/F) etc. 

* Great on campus **resources** for computer science students, such as 2 credit seminars (TSS 390) each quarter which go further into detail on principles of object oriented design or algorithms design or other specific subjects to be taken in tandem with the main class on the subject, and an open cs computer lab staffed at all times with a student mentor who should be considered a subject matter expert with any coursework you're going through as a cs student. Things like these workshops and the 24/7 lab with a mentor are invaluable to students learning computer science for the first time. 

* Ability to do **projects and research with professors** you've directly worked with in classes. Nearly every professor here has a side project or research subject they're working on, and if you do well in their class you can ask to assist in their research or project. The **little opportunities** here **feel endless** and very approachable, unlike a place like Seattle which may feel more closed off from that sort of personal request for a research position etc. You don't apply to assist with a project here, you **just ask** and chances are you're the only one who even thought to ask. 

*  UW Tacoma is **cheaper** to attend than UW Seattle. The food and housing near campus is much more affordable than at the Seattle campus. 

* CSS (Computer Science and Systems) as a **major is easy to get into**. If you have even slightly good grades (2.5 min but 3.0 is fine), you will be admitted to this program. No bs get 3.9+ in CSE142 to have a chance at getting in if you ace your other classes (like Seattle had/has). 

* Part of why the major is easy to get into, is the program is still growing. Each year there's another change to improve the structure of learning each subject and I think all the changes I've seen have been positive. And as a growing program that's still not large, you **aren't expected to know any computer science going into the program**, or really need to do anything outside of the classes to succeed in the classes. Maybe that last sentence should go a bullet above but whatever. 

UW Tacoma is good for the ambitious students because they're able to take advantage of each of the opportunities available to full effect. That's by far the best pro, unless class size matters more to you. If you don't plan on taking advantage of all the little opportunities, don't come here if you have the option, because we're about to see all the cons:

CONS:

* Bad professors will sometimes give solid passing grades to students who aren't learning. This may sound like a pro, but you can do okay in subjects and not really be learning anything and moving on through the degree requirements without ever retaining anything. Some students to on ratemyprofessor and find the easiest person each quarter and take that instructor and end up with Bs without learning, which leads me to my next point.

* Sometimes in senior classes you're interacting with people who possibly shouldn't be there. This one sounds incredibly pretentious, but occasionally I'll be talking a student through a problem and they'll fundamentally misunderstand foundational knowledge going into the problem, and I blame their past professors for that. 

* There is **no student life** at UW Tacoma. Being a commuter campus, most everyone goes to school for their classes, then leaves immediately after. Leaves as in drive away 20+ minutes to their house. Friends hang out after class and get lunch sometimes, but that's after you make the friends first. Building a good study group can be really important to your success, but it's not even close to as easy as it is at UW Seattle. We have the seattle freeze here too, and it's harder because we don't all walk back to our rooms together and keep interacting for whatever reason outside of class. 

* **Stigma** with clarifying you're **not attending UW Seattle**. You can tell everyone at this school and in the outside world knows that Tacoma is not as good as Seattle, and everyone compares the two. It's not 24/7, but it's definitely a negatively contributing factor. You will be asked why you aren't just going to UW Seattle for CS by your neighbors and friends, and you should probably have an answer ready to reuse. Mine is ""I went there for a year or so but I didn't like living in the city and it was a bit to expensive for me, but I love the smaller class sizes at tacoma so it really works out"" or something to that effect. It's kind of annoying. 

* Lots of people that I know who graduate from UW Tacoma struggle to find a job (not limited to CS). I'm not sure if it's the school or the environment or a ton of coincidences or what, but it's something to consider - it's definitely easier to find a job with UW Seattle CS on your resume. 

Most significant negative is definitely the lack of student life, and I think I've even overcome that hurdle. Next worst thing is the stigma, but the first two points are lame as well. Not sure what to think about the jobs thing until I'm really affected and can get an inside look at that process and my thoughts/feelings. 

Again these are just my thoughts as a senior in this program who's been here for a bit.  I'm sure anyone at UW Tacoma who knows me could read this thread and know exactly who I am, and if that's the case then say hi! I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about UW Tacoma or UW Tacoma CSS, now or in a year or whenever. I'll probably link this thread as my thoughts when people ask in the future, and I'll also probably edit and adjust points as they become more or less relevant etc.",dqaqmk,udub

But what I don't like and am struggling with is that the bus stop is more than a few blocks away, having to walk out to a main road. The reason I am concerned is because I get burned very easily, even with sunscreen. I have a condition where I am very sensitive to too much sun and blister, especially in the spring and summer as you can imagine.  On google maps I've also searched and noticed most bus stop are on a main road, located kind of far out from apartments/apartment complexes. What I liked about UF/Gainesville is that their were bus stops right next to the apartments, like 200 meters down the road max. Are their any smaller complexes or cheap townhouses around here, or bus stope that are maybe not showing up in Google maps that I am missing?

Off campus housing next fall - help,6,17,"It's another one of those posts, but I really need help. I've been longing to live off campus ever since I arrived here because I'm a loner who likes to be quiet and alone, and being assigned to strangers as roommates is kinda awkward for me. I'd rather live alone. 

I will be a junior next fall.

My parents have been against off campus housing for me but I finally convinced them to let me live off campus starting next fall. I'm paying with my financial aid so I have a certain budget. It's $800 MAX with all utilities included, so realistically I have to look at rental rates of $700 or below. I also want either studio or 1 br. I have no car so I need to be within walking distance to campus. They also have to be furnished because my mom is very adamant about me NOT getting furniture for myself because it's going to complicate things later when I move out or something, especially with no car.

I've been looking and searching and getting tours of all kinds of apartment options around campus and I am undecided. Right now I am pretty much guaranteed to get in a studio apartment at Osceola Apartments, it's $675 with all utilities included and comes fully furnished. My application has been approved a few days ago. The catch is that it's a super small room (245 sf) and I'm not sure if I can fit all my stuff inside. That's why I keep searching. 

I've been looking at:

Seminole Legends (but since it's a condo, units are usually available late for august move in, I don't feel safe waiting that long)

Jefferson Arms 

College Plaza (but utility bill seems super high for these units, even though paying only for electricity - supposedly their A/C is very old and not efficient at all)

Forest Hills (seems like a nice location and decent price, I have yet to get in contact with them to see if furnished options are available though) 
edit: I called & apparently they changed their name to Seminole Flatts, and their rates are definitely not within my budget. They seem to be very nice and well-rated though!

Arrowhead Apartments (looks nice, but since these units make you pay everything for utility, I'm not sure how much it would be so I am super cautious)

Benchmark West Apartments (have yet to get in contact with them for furniture package price as well as rental rates) 
edit: called them, and they don't offer furniture packages. Why say they do on the site then? Very misleading.

Skyview (again, have yet to get in touch with them)

A University View 

Franklin Pointe

Colony Club (seemed nice and nice location, however reviews online are scary and I only saw their model apartment so I don't know what to expect)

Campus Walk (reviews online scare me, especially the bit about ""prostitutes"" and ""thugs"" around the complex. I'd really like a safe environment)

... I guess this is about it for now. I've been searching nonstop and had a lot more options but as soon as I learned I need to find furnished options they dramatically shrunk in size. Anyone who lived in any of these apartments and/or have an opinion/advice for me, please comment, thank you! ",3z1csd,fsu

I don't care how ghetto or basic it is, my only wish is that I get somewhere really near campus.

"Don’t have the money to buy a meal plan, but locked into living in a dorm. What are my options?",19,16,"Mostly described in the title.

A few months ago, I stupidly filled out the housing contract without looking at other options, and didn’t tour any off campus apartments because I live six hours away. My financial aid covers my tuition and most of my housing, but none is left for meals. 

I plan on working while in college, but I wouldn’t have the money up front to pay for a meal plan by the payment date without taking on student loans (unsubsidized are what I would have to take out), which I’m desperately trying to avoid.

Ive been accepted into higher ranking schools in areas I love, but I would potentially have to take out 20-30k in loans a year and lose 40-80k in future med school  funds.

I got accepted into the Biomathematics PHD program in January, and I’m so excited as FSU was my first choice!

I’m from out-of-state, and attended a much smaller school than FSU. I’ve interacted with students in my program, but I figured I’d give this sub a shot too.

My boyfriend and I are planning on moving down in the beginning of August - we don’t need anything super fancy as I will only be TAing and he will be searching for a job in the meantime. What affordable off-campus living situations are there? Preferably one that allows animals. Any to avoid? When should I expect to have a lease signed by?

My last school was mainly a commuter school. Do a lot of people drive to class? How hard is it to find a parking spot, generally? I know large schools in my area parking is hell in the mornings, if not impossible.

Can anyone attest to the quality of FSU’s counselling center? How hard is it to get an appointment? I like to consider my mental health well-managed, but I had a good relationship with the counselling center at my school in case I needed someone.

Are there ways to get involved that don’t cost hundreds of dollars in club fees? I was mainly thinking stuff in the ESPORTS realm, as I love LoL and my boyfriend is a huge computer guy himself.

Also, I’ll be visiting at the end of this month. Anything off the top of your head that I should check out/do? I am not sure when or if I will be able to visit again before I move down, so anything really big I would love to get a head-start on. ",apqd6x,fsu

My Freshman Experience and advice I would give to future Noles.,53,17,"Hello! I am a freshman at FSU and have been having a great year so far. I just want to help out any incoming freshman how I can by telling them what I did and wish I did throughout this year. Let's start with the life lessons I learned:

Dorms:
https://photos.app.goo.gl/tFI7ltEJgwjgl58n1
That link is from my dorm room. The moral of the story is DO NOT LIVE IN SALLEY HALL. Live off campus before living there. The photos show water damage, mold, cockroach fungus in the corners, and later I will add a photo of the bathroom to show how bad it is. None of the pictures show the 12 cockroaches my roommate and I had to spray and stomp when we were cleaning our room this weekend. At $3000 a semester, you are paying about $800 per month for rent, which is comparable to some of the nicest apartments in the Tallahassee area, such as a 4/4 room at Onyx, the new expensive place in college town. Mind you, the room is extremely small, with just about 250 square feet to be shared by 4 people. The staff is nice, but not always responsive to issues (our sink leaked for a month before we were able to get it fixed, however it was mostly because one request was put in the wrong place and we were not in the room when they came to check). I simply cannot say this place is worth a penny of what I'm spending when I am rooming next year off campus for less than half the cost for rent. To me having an RA isn't quite worth the extra penny (love ya alyssa). Some of the other dorms are nicer however. My girlfriend lives in Jennie Murphree Hall, and it has much more space, but other than location I would say the price is also extreme for what is given. That being said I think it is worth it to spend a year on campus if you can get a nicer dorm, as it creates a college community and keeps you safer and more responsible during year one. 

Meal plan:
Lucky you, meal plans are not mandatory next semester. I would recommend not having one if you are in any need for money. In case you cannot tell by my tone yet, I have had a very bad experience with Sodexo. The company follows horrible business practices and tries to lie and decieve you into giving them money. The mandatory meal plan this semester costs $1799. To add the VIP package (which allows you to exchange a swipe a day at a better location) it tacks an extra $100 to that. The meal plan provides 200 meals. When broken down with flexbucks ignored, it ends up being $9 per meal. You can almost eat Olive garden for that price, and that is every time you swipe; breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With that, the VIP package is only worth $6 at most locations. This means that every time you use the package you payed extra for, you are actually paying more than they are providing you. I end up eating Subway nearly every day as a result of it being the only place on campus where it is worth more, at $9 per swipe which is what it should be. My girlfriend did not have money to pay the plan, and when they moved Suwannee dining hall down to the union, they still required her to pay for it, and she was given the choice to move out or pay 2000 she didn't have. The people were very rude to her throughout the experience and I have nothing but resentment towards Sodexo. The dining hall food is mediocre, and they always put a show on when the parents come for orientation, but the food is horrible the rest of the year. All that said, I hate Sodexo, not the FSU dining workers. A lot of them are extremely nice and talkative people that are enjoyable to be around, but Sodexo themselves just steal your money in my opinion. 


Alright, negative stuff is done. Let's get to some things I wish I did:

Recreational sports - I love being active and doing sports, but with me being a music Major I had to spend all my time on that. I intend on joining a team next semester, maybe swim or soccer! 

Clubs: my girlfriend just joined FSU Teach and the Teachers club and loves the atmosphere and friends she has met in it. I am part of a few groups but I will also be joining some next semester. 


Some things I learned:

FSU reimbursement: it's kind of dangerous I'm saying this, but any school related trip will be helped out by FSU. For example, I completed in a 3 level collegiate competition where I had to travel around the country, and the college helped me and my quartet out monetarily throughout the process. That being said, don't abuse it. The school has limited amounts of money they can give for these things, whether travel, research, or competition fees. So don't expect your meals and car rentals paid for unless you are spending very little on everything else. 

Practice: especially for musicians, but really for everyone. Study or practice and spend as much time on this stuff as you can. You are at school to learn and improve and become a master at what you are studying. Don't mess this up with too many drinks or video games. 

Fun: have it. College happens once, and it's at a great time in life when everyone around you is at their most explorative and social. So have fun and become an adult. Party with friends and be as social as you can, I am an introvert and I have come out of my shell a lot throughout this year. 

Drinking: up to you. I don't drink because I find it doesn't really suit my style of fun, but a lot of people do it and a lot of people love it here at FSU (or any college). Just don't let anyone make you do it, and don't do it just because you think you can't have fun without it. Trust me, around campus there is always something to do that is sober, like visiting the REZ or STUDYING or going to the gym. Have fun whatever way you want, but don't have so much fun you have to drop out. Remember: 4 years of good fun > 1 year of lots of fun and a lifetime without a degree or losing all scholarships and help. 

Your teachers care: they really don't want you to fail, however it isn't high school where they let you get away with laziness. They will give you a C or a D if you are late on assignments or do bad on a quiz they didn't plan on curving. The mentality amongst all the teachers I have had is that they will help those who come to them and who want to improve. To the others they have to help themselves. 

TAs are awesome: when you walk into class and your teacher is 23 instead of 93, don't think that they don't know every single word of the textbook. Their lives since their first day of college has been based in that material. A physics lab tech will have been studying physics since their freshman year, and are typically as smart as the professor (minus experience and doctoral knowledge yadayada). What I am trying to say is that you should treat them as a professor and get their help as if they are your major teacher. 


Tl;Dr fsu is a great place to grow. I have been here one year and I am much more mature and social than I was through high school. It will be a great experience, and more than anything the people here are awesome. Be wary of the companies that run the campus, but other than that have fun and do what you can to become the best person you can be. Find success and explore. And go Noles!",87j9wv,fsu

Question about fall 2018 transfer applications and housing,3,4,"Hi everyone, I am currently going to New College of Florida and I submitted a transfer application to FSU in early January to go there for the polysci program. I got a notice from FSU that said that I need to show that I've completed a college level math course, so I'm going to take a CLEP test for that at the end of this month and send it to FSU to meet that requirment for transfer. I just had a few questions for anyone who might have an answer.

1. The college that I'm at right now is very non-traditional, we don't even have grades here and we don't follow the same kind of mapping for classes for certain majors that traditional colleges/universities (like FSU) have. So I was wondering if there was any way to see if I meet the requirements for the political science major with the classes that I've taken so far. I've looked at the academic map and I know what the classes are at FSU, but I don't know how those translate to ones that I've taken so far.

2. Since I have to do the CLEP test I probably won't get a decision for another month and a half, so with that in mind what are my odds for getting off campus housing? Should I apply for a dorm, or will I even be able to? And if there isn't a good chance to get a dorm, what are some good apartment options around the school?

Thank you! I hope to be seeing some of you this upcoming fall!",7ygn81,fsu

West 10 vs The Forum (or suggestions),2,7,"Has anyone lived in West 10 or the Forum and would like to share their living experience?

My girlfriend and I are looking to lease a one bedroom apartment starting in the fall next year. We are open to other suggestions but have narrowed it down to either The Forum or West 10. She likes West 10 and I like The Forum. 

The problem: West 10 is more impressive in person, but the all reviews I've read lead toward the Forum being better. Is West 10 really full of roaches or is that all exaggeration? I've also read about break-ins at West 10. The Forum has negative reviews towards management and trash pickup, but not in room safety/cleanliness. 

We've toured so many apartments and most tours lead to us to being impressed. The online reviews are a different story, though. The 5 star reviews seem fake and the 1 star reviews have left a sour taste in our mouth.

Anyways does anyone whose lived off campus in any of these places have any input?

We are just looking for a safe, clean, and furnished place. 

tl;dr: Couple looking for a one bedroom apartment that is furnished, safe and clean. Opinions on Forum and West 10 welcome, as are suggestions.

Thank you!",57evbo,fsu
Prospective student looking for advice,5,18,"FSU is my first choice and I'm looking for advice on multiple topics. 

Care Program? would anyone recommend/not recommend, experiences, etc

I will have a car with me because my parents are moving out of state and I heard the parking is horrible so any advice on having a car.

I applied for summer and I'm thinking of living on campus for summer and off campus for fall. Any advice for don't live in a dorm/don't live off campus? 

I toured Venetian Villas and think I would like to live there. Anyone who has lived in Venetian Villas or knows someone who has would you recommend? 

Is it hard to get a job that is better then working at a fast food restaurant? As a high school student I currently work at a large doctors office and I'm wondering what the job outlook is usually. 

I am thinking of majoring in accounting so any advice for that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Any advice you can give to me on basically anything college related would be helpful considering my parents did not go to college and neither of my sisters went away to school and only attended community college.

A note regarding the fire on Zulema to off campus residents.,45,11,"I'm sure by now all of you have heard about the large fire on Zulema Street which destroyed the building and left its residents homeless and without most of their possessions. 

I don't know how preventable the fire was, but I do know that many buildings in the neighborhood are not up to code in terms of smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. As someone who has lived in South Oakland for awhile, I know that the vast majority of houses and apartments do not have working smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. 

Per the fire code in Pennsylvania, every house or apartment should have one 5lb fire extinguisher in the kitchen. [This](https://fireextinguisherdepot.com/fire-extinguishers-1/fire-extinguishers-by-ul-rating/2a-10b-c/amerex-b500-abc-fire-extinguisher-5-lb-2a-10b-c-html.html) is what it should look like; if you have a smaller one without a hose, it is not up to code. Each extinguisher should have a tag on it that states the last time it was tested. If this date occured more than a year ago, it is not up to code and needs to be checked or replaced (the same goes for missing tags).

Additionally there should be a smoke detector on each floor of the apartment or house (includes basements and attics) and they should be located within 15' of sleeping areas. 

Both of these are to be installed and maintained by the landlord. If an insurance company can prove that one or both of these things were either not present or not in good working order, both you and your landlord can have a very hard time getting any type of payment in the event of a fire. Please, take the time to check your equipment and if it is faulty notify your landlord. It's worth the time for all of us.",1bbfm8,Pitt
Summer off campus housing question,3,12,"Hi all, 

So due to some unforseen circumstances and some ridiculous bullshit with my co-op my search for just a summer sublet turned into trying to find somewhere to live all of next year as well. My parents are firmly against me living alone, but I think I have a roommate locked down for the fall (she's a friend who will be transferring in from Greensburg.) 

So basically I'm trying to find a two bedroom apartment with a lease starting in May that would run through the following school year, or something I could sublet through the summer and renew for the following year in August. I'm trying extremely hard not to get into a situation where  moving every four months, and the argument with my parents just keeps coming back to 'well if worst comes to worst you could just commute' which I don't think would be particularly good for my mental health based on how I feel now, living at home. 

I've looked at two places already, both of which my parents have been pretty well opposed to but I thought were tolerable for Oakland standards. Any advice? 

Tldr; I need to find a two bedroom for May through the school year. How fucked am I? 

Update: found somewhere to sublet for the summer; now struggling to find somewhere for the fall. Thanks for all your help guys! ",2yeksu,Pitt

Hey, I'm looking for recommendations regarding the best off-campus housing options. I'm probably looking at 1BD but would entertain a 2BD option if the price was right.

On/Off Campus Housing.,1,6,"Ay. It's me again. Posted a thread hours ago, thanks for all the input, but after an afternoon of consideration, off campus sounds like a better fit to me in terms of cost and facilities \(I think most facilities in dorms are a bit extra to me\).

Need serious advice & your personal experience. I'm an incoming freshmen, and though many says living on campus during freshmen year is a must for the ""dorm experience"", but the cost is too high compared to off campus and I don't think it's that worth it. So, I need to know your personal experience so I can make a better choice from all of your inputs. 

1. How much did it cost you for living in a 2/3 bedrooms apartment per person, after including extra costs such as water/electricity \(Also, please tell me how far is it from campus\)
2. Do most apartments provide furnishes like beds etc. ?
3. Is it TOO late to find off campus housing now? \(Might be slightly more expensive ones but still, cheaper than dorms\)
4. I actually signed a contract with Housing, hope that they could let me cancel my contract though it might be unlikely, but I read some successful attempts.

"Received an alcohol citation, have to meet with university offices",14,18,"Long story short, I was seen by a UWPD officer buying alcohol from a liquor store.

The Future of Memorial and Kohler Libraries,2,6,"I am a junior at the university.  I am a North Carolinian so I pay about twice the tuition of Wisconsinites and Minnesotans.  Last month I attended a talk concerning the proposed plan to cut the size of Memorial Library by 75% and Kohler by some unspecified amount---I assume the worst.

The plan would involve moving some part of the specified 75% to a warehouse in Verona where they would be sorted by weight and size. (""Unlike a traditional library, books are not shelved according to subject, content, or by volume. Instead, it’s all about size. Books are trucked to Verona on carts, and then sorted by size, placed into cardboard trays, bar-coded, and shelved. Completely filled, Verona is expected to hold over a million volumes. Right now, Klecker and Hursh are quickly working to sort and shelve as many books as possible before the facility’s content becomes available for borrowing in February."" -- https://www.library.wisc.edu/news/2014/03/19/library-of-the-month-verona-shelving-facility/) Not by title, not by author, not by subject, not by call number, not even by publication date.  The other part of the 75% would be shredded.  Let me repeat that: SHREDDED.  As in 'forever 'lost'.  Even assuming a particular book is not shredded, if I need a book, I don't want to wait three days for it 
(""HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET AN ITEM FROM ONE OF THE SHELVING FACILITIES?

If you are requesting an item from one of our on-campus shelving facilities it will take between one to three business days.

If you are requesting an item from one of our off-campus shelving facilities the time could vary depending on where the material is coming from. These requests are handled by Interlibrary Loan Staff and have similar delivery times as ILL requests."" 

-- https://www.library.wisc.edu/collections/library-collections/shelving-facilities/storage-facility-faq/)

Supposedly, the first and second floors of the library do not meet the spacial demands of students who wish to ""collaborate"" there and feel we need to remove three quarters of the building.  I think that this is insane.  I could have gone to Chapel Hill for a slightly higher but stable tuition cost instead of coming all the way here.  I didn't.  Now that tuition is rising and the semesters are getting shorter (this Spring semester is a week shorter than it used to be) I am looking to get the most out of my four years here as I can.

Personal reasons aside, I am astonished that this plan has even become a serious possibility.  Anybody who has been to a university's main library knows that you come with a few titles in mind, and leave with at least one title you didn't even know was there.

This is also going to impact future students who decide (for some reason) to come here as well.  I have been reading the campus publications and trying to keep up with local politics and am very saddened to see how things are progressing.

If you feel the same way I do about this ridiculous plan, please sign the petition against it here: https://goo.gl/8oCcjT.  It is a public Google Doc that doesn't require signing in to sign. Whether you are an undergrad, a graduate student, or an alumnus/a, I feel that this matter involves us all.

The Sett Rant,64,44,"
The Sett changed their menu right at the beginning of this year. I was optimistic going in since the sett was never anything to rave about, not saying it was bad or anything. 

   However this new menu is not good. Like  at all. Every new item I’ve gotten has been terrible. I got the Philly cheese steak and it wasn’t super flavorful. On top of that the cheese and pepper mix they put on the top of the sandwich looked like straight up vomit. I’m not expecting some really good cheese steak out of the restaurant in the union of a college in Wisconsin but like idk anyone whose gonna want to eat that thing. I got the garlic parmasean wings recently and the sauce was horrendous. It had a gross texture and idk what the flavor was but it’s nasty. I’m glad they put it on the side cause I threw that shit out immediately. I don’t think I’m very picky either. I ate the philly cheese steak despite it being gross. I could not eat that ducking sauce. I haven’t tried any of their new burgers but considering I was never a huge fan of the burgers before I don’t imagine the new ones will be much better. Maybe their salads are good or something

I just don’t understand why when they were redoing the menu they actually thought these new items would be an improvement. Ik they took off a bunch of items that were fine including garlic fries which I thought was the best thing on their menu. Maybe it’s a money thing idk. The only good thing they did was add the sett cause but it’s just the same sauce as der rath skeller that they make in the whatever kitchen they make that sauce in UW and then ship it over and imo there’s no reason that the Sett shouldn’t have had it before. They might as well have brought the ranch over cause they “house make” it at der rath skeller (idk if it’s actually house made but it’s better than the super thick stuff at the Sett). Also there is like never condiments like any time I’ve gone this year in the pumps. Idk what’s up with that.

In terms of just talking about a restaurant I shouldn’t care much. I mean I’m not tryna go to the Sett to have good food, I’m going there cause I have classes on the south end of campus and I want lunch. But with harvest grains closed the best restaurant in my opinion is somehow urban slice (ginger root isn’t good either)and it should not be that way. I just am frustrated by options at this point and I can just get like chicken nuggets and fires at the sett but I used to actually like going there (occasionally).

PSA Don’t work for the Lowell center,22,8,"Update: If anyone cares. Our old boss (currently the director of both conference centers) emailed me about the situation. They’re taking it seriously and going to do what they can to address it. He’s done a good job with rude employees in the past, so I think that he’ll do a good job with this issue, too.

As far as campus jobs go, Lowell center catering isn’t actually that bad. The job itself is pretty easy, getting meals almost every shift is great, and it’s not a huge time commitment. *However*, the supervisor and catering manager have been getting more and more aggressive. The supervisor has always been passive-aggressive and fairly dismissive. She has a rather low opinion of student employees, and doesn’t take us for our word when we say we’re struggling. 

One of my coworkers, who came to every single shift on time the first semester I worked with her, needed a break from working and asked not to be scheduled (she’s a freshmen and taking difficult classes). The supervisor brushed her off and continued to schedule her, so she ended up quitting. 

As for myself, throughout most of this semester I have been struggling with severe depression and horrific side effects from starting an SSRI. I’ve been missing class, had to miss work several days because I was too spacey to be able to make it to work safely, not to mention I couldn’t concentrate at all. I told my bosses as much and my supervisor seemed to brush me off and made several comments about how I can’t keep calling off last minute. I know that I couldn’t keep doing that, but if I can’t make it to work safely, I’m not going to put myself in harms way. Depression and SSRI side effects are pretty random. I can’t predict when I’m going to be spaced out of my mind. She also spoke to me like I was dumb when I was experiencing CD as a result of depression. 

About a week ago, both bosses sent out nastygrams. The supervisor’s was about getting a lot of “requests for time off” that were “last minute”. The reason she got *a lot* of them was because she scheduled employees outside of the employee availability spreadsheet (note the dictionary definition of “availability”). She later said that the “availability sheet” is *actually* a “preferred shift sheet”. The reason this bothers me so much is that *when* she made it she *told me* that the sheet was being made so that she didn’t have to look at class schedules for our availability. Several emails followed explaining what the “availability sheet” means, and that she had to edit the schedule a lot.  One of the emails stated that she uses our class schedules for availability and admitted that she, for the most part, ignores our declared availability and acts as though are only commitments are class and work. 

The nastygram that our manager sent had to do with why we weren’t using the web clock app, and that we should be using it. The reason a lot of us weren’t using the app was because it was being glitchy and wouldn’t let us clock in no matter what device we tried using. This happens a lot to the app, and our last boss was well aware of how glitchy it is. Long story short: the email was very sarcastic and snippy and said we should be using the app no matter what.

TL;DR: Lowell center catering supervisor and manager are hostile and getting worse. Lowell has a ridiculously high turnover rate for a reason. Avoid this place.",du7mm5,UWMadison
"Moving out issues, what are all you doing?",11,8,"So like many of you that live off campus, I get kicked out the 14th and move in the 15th. Bigger issue is that I'm bringing a car on the night of the 13th from MN so I can move out the 14th, but I'm concerned about parking.

Advice on Parking?,2,7,I'm going to be starting my first semester here this week and one thing I haven't worked out yet is my plan for parking. I live in Madison off Campus.

Dear Freshman.....,282,57,"**\*\*\*\*\*Edit 2 : Hi guys, thank you so much for all the responses and comments. Since this post has gained so much traction on here, I feel as if it would be helpful to have this posted on Facebook/Twitter or something, where more people (Reddit's user base barely contains any freshmen and is not a true representation of UW Madison Campus) can read it and hopefully follow it.  I don't have an active Facebook account and don't know where I would post something like this. Are there groups or something where I can post this or link it? Or if you want to link it, that'd be great as well. Otherwise, without any action from Freshmen and even some upper classmen, this is going to keep occurring. Let me know in the comments down below or PM me.**  

&#x200B;

Dear Freshman,

Welcome to the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am glad you are here. You made it through four-years of high school. Many of you are going to accomplish great things here and have a lot of fun. But before we get to the good stuff, there are some housekeeping things you ought to know. Some unspoken rules you need to follow.

&#x200B;

1. Walk on the right side. That's it. Don't walk with four of the same people on the path. Walk in groups of two or by yourself. As you will quickly realize, there are a lot of people here that need to get to a lot of places in a short amount of time.
2. If you are on the 80, pay attention. Please walk to the back of the bus so other students are on it. Your fellow classmates will thank you when because you moved, they were able to make it to their class on time without freezing off their balls off.
3. The bus system works like this : Before your stop comes, you pull the yellow string  and a bell rings to let the driver know. On the new 80, I think you have to press the yellow strip. Also, please say thank you to ours(and your) bus drivers as they work really long hours, dealing with college kids, driving the same route.
4. When going into lectures, if you are first, go in to the middle of the row. Sit on the outside ONLY if you need to get to another class quickly.
5. Speaking of lectures, if you are waiting for a lecture to be over, so you can go in. Please give the people that are coming out more than enough space. It will save both of you time.
6. If you are using one of the recreational facilities (Nat or Shell or Ogg) and using the weight room during the busy time, if there are people waiting, ask them if they want to work in. If you are waiting, ask them if you can work in with them. Most people will let you. Additionally, be aware of your surroundings (it's a small area for so many people) as there will be guys (especially the powerlifters) who will be squatting and benching a lot of weight - make sure you don't bump into them.
7. Speaking of the gym, clean the equipment and please put the weights back. Simple but some people just don't get it.

&#x200B;

If the freshman here have any questions, comment below or message me. Additionally, let these ""unspoken"" rules know to your friends as they will benefit from them as well.

Senior Badgers of this subreddit, if you have any other tips for our freshman class, please write them in the comments below. Additionally, if anything in this list needs to be moderated or edited, let me know as well.

On Wisconsin!

**Edit 1 :** This is life advice in general but necessary for the freshman. If you are the one that does not like to partake in drinking, smoking, doing drugs, etc., do Not feel pressured to try those things. Forcing yourself to do those things will make you drop your self-esteem and create self-hatred, which can lead to mental health issues such as depression. Trust me when I say but it’s better to be lonely with self-esteem than broken with “friends”.

If you are making any big decision, sleep on it and then make it the next day. Don’t rush it. You have plenty of time.",cyu2y0,UWMadison

Un-Fuck Your Wiscmail,55,14,"Wiscmail used to be unusable.  Wall-to-wall spam, even beyond the junk mail filter.  Even ""Unsubscribe"" rarely seemed to work.  Ever wonder why?

In UW's own words:

>The University of Wisconsin-Madison frequently receives requests for student email and postal addresses from third-party vendors such as credit card companies, off-campus housing, etc and also from Registered Student Organizations (RSO).

Shitty.  Fortunately, you can opt out of this.  In your Student Center (my.wisc.edu > Student Services > Student Center, for you rookies), scroll to the bottom - underneath ""Academics"" and ""Finances"" is a section for ""Personal Information"".  Click on the drop-down box (""other personal..."") and select ""Restrict Third-Party Mail"".  You can withhold your email address and mailing address from being distributed en masse.

**tl;dr**: End wiscmail spam, scroll to bottom of student center, restrict third-party mail",2fp0al,UWMadison

Grad Student Heading Your Way (Questions),5,16,"Hey! I'll be heading up to UW Madison in the fall for a masters in mechanical engineering. I'm coming from NC State in Raleigh, NC. I've got a few new student questions. I'll number them, so y'all can pick which ones to answer.

1. Living situation? Do most (grad) students live on or off campus? Where are cool places to live? What is the expected price range of off/on campus apartments? How far away are most apartments from campus? I don't really need a quiet place and I am on a bit of a budget. I also wouldn't mind living somewhere lively (mature party area = ok). When should I start looking on craigslist? Anyone looking for a roommate?

2. Car? I think I will be buying a car before heading to Madison. How important is an AWD car? Any car advice? This goes back to the living situation, but should I expect to be commuting to campus? Are there buses or do people walk to campus? I don't suppose motorcycles are very useful, right?

3. Cold? For people who may have come from somewhere much warmer, like me, whats it like to go to a school up north? Any advice? lol

4. Any on campus groups worth checking out? What can I expect from UW Madison?  Hype me up! I skateboard, DJ my college radio, bowl, motorcycle, party, drink, etc.

Anyway, I'm excited to be moving to Madison! Thanks in advance everyone!

Would any of you be interested in something like this?,4,7,"So this would be more targeted for people living off-campus, but I have an idea for a service where you basically go to a website, select a certain meal plan (standard, vegetarian, low-cal, high-cal, gluten-free etc.) and then on a weekly basis you just get a bunch of groceries along with (simple) recipes for that week delivered to your door. This would include dinners for the whole week (and possibly lunch and breakfast too).

How much would you be willing to pay for something like that, if at all? $50 per week? $75? $100? Less than $50? How much do you spend on groceries now?

Just to give a little more detail, you'd also be able to select which/how many meals you want per week and the weekly price would obviously scale with that.

Incoming freshman thinking of applying for summer start,1,2,"As I have already taken a drop year, I was thinking of starting early. My question is since most QR-A courses aren't offered in the summer, is it possible to take CS 302 in the summer and then the QR-A course in the Fall?

On a side note: I'm going to take the AP Calc BC this may. I see that Algebra 112 is offered in the Summer, and it says closed to students with credit for Math 221, but by the time the summer term starts I will not have my AP results. So if I take that course can I take CS 302 alongside it? And if I do get a 4 or a 5 on the AP and decide to take credit for Math 221 and 222 what happens to my Algebra 112 credit?",4dcnwg,UWMadison
Bus Etiquette,9,4,"I've noticed that there have been quite a few times when bus travel on campus has been not as good as it could have been, so here's a little primer to make sure that everyone's bus ride goes as smoothly as possible!

* When you get on the bus, move to the back! All the way to the back! Yes, that means up the stairs as far back as you can possibly get 

* If possible, sit down, especially if the bus is crowded (or is likely to get crowded). Even if you're comfortable standing, taking a seat opens up more standing room, which allows more people to get on the bus and not have to wait for the next one. Sometimes this can be awkward, especially if the last empty seat is sandwiched between two people who take up a lot of space, but remember that every extra person who can squeeze on the bus is another person who doesn't have to wait however many minutes for the next one

* If the bus is crowded, take off your backpack and put it between your feet! This is one that a lot of people don't know (and that I only learned myself last year). Backpacks take up a bunch of space when they're on people's backs, but they take up significantly less space when they're on the floor. Again, it's about fitting as many people on the bus as possible, so that no one needs to stand outside in the weather waiting for the next one when there might have been room for them

* Let people get off before you get on! Not only does this make sure that everyone gets off the bus before the doors close, it will also ensure that you get more spaces and seats from which to choose! On a related note, only enter from the front door, even on the free 8x busses. Some cities have their busses equipped for rear-door entry; Madison is not one of them. In addition to throwing off the bus driver's count, entering from the rear is also kind of a dick move to just skip ahead of the people lined up for the front. 

* Don't pull the stop-request cord at the last minute! If the driver is almost at the stop and doesn't see anyone waiting, and hasn't had a stop requested yet, they may not be in the correct lane to be able to stop. So pull that cord early; if you can, try to pull it even before the name of the stop is announced!

* Thank the bus driver! Busses are cool, and so are the people who drive them!",derpke,UWMadison
Senior next year with current roommates graduating. Where should I live?,3,8,"So yeah, I'm currently a junior; I lived in Sellery my freshman year and have lived off campus the last two years.

PSA for all my fellow bus 80'ers,148,17,"I just got off the 80 today from classes and with the increasingly nasty Wisconsin weather that's going to be culminating on wed, I thought it would be nice to review the following:

1. **Please, for the love of god, seriously, actually move to the back of the bus.** Don't stand there like a deer in headlights and stare at the empty space. People need to get on, the buses are behind schedule, waiting for the next whole bus is brutal. *This means shoulder to shoulder people.*
2. **Have some spatial awareness.** Literally saw this huge guy desperately try to push pass this tiny girl who was paying too much attention to her phone to try and make space for people getting on the bus. The space was 3-4 people wide.
3. **Getting on the bus just to ride up Bascom Hill is a d\*\*k move, especially during peak bus hours.** There are some people who consider this a tasteless move during normal peak hours. Remember there are people going from the east spread apartments/dorms to the stop by Agricultural Hall, or even worse, to Animal Sciences and the Actual University Hospital. I'm looking at you, the people who go from Memorial Union to the Muir Woods stop #60 next to Bascom Hall or Sewell Soc Sci.

Cheap/Good (American) Chinese food around state street?,7,9,"Last semester, Soga Shabu Shabu was my salvation. My $7.75 + tax for a to go lo mein or General Tso's chicken that would last me 2-3 meals was a blessing. I recently went back there and apparently there is a new owner. The menu was different and my receipt says ""Taste of Sichuan"" on it now. The most appalling part was the price jump. I wasn't going to walk out because I was already seated but the base prices on the menu (at least for my usual items) jumped by a little over 35% ($7.75 to $11.95). I am now looking for a replacement.

I have had Asian Kitchen before. I hated it the first time but figured maybe that was a one-off time so I had it again a few weeks later. I ended up throwing it out it was so bad. I have never thrown Chinese food out before.

Don't want to go back to UW.,54,51,"Title says it all, but brief details of my situation are below. Just looking for some help and guidance as I feel pretty lost.

I'm a freshman coming back to Madison today and I want nothing more than to stay home. It's not an academic issue -- I did very well my first semester. I worked super hard and it paid off. That said, I had pretty much no social life despite living Sellery/Witte (don't want to give my exact dorm away). I like being social and I love going out, but I didn't click with anyone living on my floor in the way that they did with each other. They all formed friend groups by week 2 & I was left alone. It was embarrassing to ask people what they were up to every weekend night so I just stopped. I was pretty depressed in October and faced an anxiety relapse (am diagnosed anxiety, went to therapy in HS, got a lot better and I manage it well, but it came back in full force mid-September), it got slightly better when I met some friends through classes in November b/c I didn't feel so alone, but I still had a cloud hanging over my head that was magically lifted every time I left campus to go home. I don't go out with my roommate because they are attached at the hip to their S/O, & both of them are inconsiderate and just generally rude people so I don't like hanging out with them.

So yeah, I'm not sure what to do. I don't think my situation would be amended by transferring; in fact, I think I'd probably struggle a lot more if I switched to another school and had to readjust all over again. But the combination of my lack of friends (all of my friends through classes already have friend groups as well) + awful roommate situation + difficult course load makes the prospect of another semester unbearable. I'm already looking forward to May 11.

First off, I wanted to say Ramadan Mubarak to my community of both Muslims and non-Muslims! 

Ramadan is my favorite holiday to spend with family and friends, however, I am in Madison this Summer and will miss a majority of Ramadan with my family. Is there any Muslims still on campus interested in getting together and getting to know each other over this month and breaking fast together? 

Peace be upon you all!

Should I get a residential parking permit?,8,8,"For those who live in apartments near campus, would you recommend grabbing a parking permit from the city over monthly off-street parking?

Looking for an apartments: things to watch out for or to avoid,11,31,"After living in the dorms for two years, I decided to live in an apartment for next year.  I'm pretty new to the whole apartment search thing, and I want to try to avoid a bad first experience, so I thought I'd ask about pointers about what to look for. 
For instance, should I shoot for an unit with utilities, or is it cheaper to pay for my own? I seem to hear good things about McBride, and their units are reasonably priced while including heat and water.    Hear that Mullins is reasonable enough and they have a place that covers all utilities at an affordable price, but I have reservations about the location (just off state).
I'm trying to keep my monthly payments around roughly 600 a month for a studio, hopefully including utilities - the cheaper the better, but I realize that it's better to pay for quality.  I can live with taking the bus a reasonable distance to campus if it means getting a good value.  I'd rather avoid the big party neighborhoods if possible.

Thanks in advance.",23j7ul,UWMadison
Accepted!,6,7,"Late last night I got the much awaited for email notifying me that I was accepted. I'm not sure exactly which college I would like to attend so before you continue reading I would like to make you aware that this post will basically outline some questions I have about UW-Madison.

Anyway to begin I have three schools in which I am really intrigued by; the first is UW-Madison, the second is UW-Seattle (Washington), and the third is the University of Texas-Austin. The only one I've been accepted to thus far is UW-Madison, decisions from the other two are projected to arrive in March. Due to the fact that I don't know about the other as of right now UW-Madison is the best choice that I have so here are some of my questions about the school and campus life.

To start off I would like to do a dual major in Computer Science and a business degree of sorts. From experience how difficult is it to pursue each? Are the classes mostly lectured based? I live in rural Missouri and I have little experience in the work space with technology will I be able to compete for internships and jobs around the area in the technology industry? I want to develop software and stray aware from the hardware aspect of computers, how does this affect me in pursuing CS?

As stated I'm from the rural Missouri, is the weather really that bad? Is walking to class a dreadful experience? How's the food on campus? 

I also planned on living in the dorms and online they look pretty nice. Are they as nice as they look? Is there a lot of conflict in the dorms? Are they loud or quite most of the time?

TL;DR I'm just looking for your opinion of the campus and how I would get along being a badger.",43ps46,UWMadison

Congratulations other graduates! What did you think of the ceremony? Plus my own rant about how I love this place.,20,4,"Warning, wall of text incoming. I had a lot of thoughts I wanted to get out. I also typed this all of my phone because my computer is dead, so there might be a few weird Autocorrects or mistakes in there. 

Honestly, I thought it sucked. This is not me complaining the ceremony was lame or boring just because I'm too cool for school but I thought it failed at being about the students or being inspirational. 70 percent of the time was spent by the high level academics introducing each other or their various titles and talking about the University and tooting various horns instead of students. Some of this was to be expected, but even when the people had free speaking to say what they wanted they still focused on this and the boring things the University usually spins as their marketing ideas that you  hear from the higher ups in serious emails and can read in a pamphlet. I was honestly insulted when one spent so much time talking about the great higher up faculty and research most students never see and mentioned the students present in one sentence. One mentioned a great gift and the described the tiny pin we were given. (thanks, great value for the $40000+ pin) These people got to their positions by being smart and hard workers, not being great public speakers, so most of them were hit miss.

 While I love Jon Huntsman's politics and him as a person, his whole speech was about politics and his own organization. I defended the choice when it first picked but I was definitely disappointed. Not really surprising he focused on politics, his speech have was Ok, but not about the graduates other than their political future which is only a small portion of their lives. Also talked about his own organization a lot which I didn't want to hear at that point. Russel Wilson would have been a much better choice. While he's an athlete he's still a super smart guy with great work ethic, and everything I've watched of him and his dad's relationship has shown he has good things to say. He was just a student too and honestly we would have followed him to jump off a building if he said so, the students love him so much. Huntsman obviously rolled in a few days ago and was updated on the various stereotypes and jokes and popular things to do.  Didn't feel that genuine although it's obvious he's a pretty good nice guy. We just love Madison here so an outsider trying to fit in sticks out like a sore thumb. Would have really liked someone else or a different speech focus. I know reddit had a hard on for him, but Niel Degrasse Tyson managed to be an amazing inspirational speaker about not settling for the amount of knowledge you have now while still focusing a lot on his astronomy work a lot. So glad I stopped by his speech for seniors last year.

Rebecca Blank was also obviously new here and it made a lot of her talk of the traditions less genuine. She tried hard though and did have a few decently fun and genuine moments, her speech was Ok but I think she will have better ones in the future. Still not over my former Chancellor Biddy crush because I knew she actually genuinly cared about us, regardless of what ideas she had for the University that didn't work out before she left. She stopped on the snowball fight day my freshman year, which I thought I was about to get in trouble because she kinda grabbed me, but it was not for any other reason than she wanted to talk about how my semester, school work, and social life had been going. She complimented my helmet and died shield and asked me about strategy. Just like a cool aunt would at your family party. She then told me to have fun and stay safe and pulled another person aside. She did this for atleast 45 minutes spending atleast 3 minutes or so on everyone. I'm sure some of the administrators are great people but I've never seen anyone who actually made an effort to care that much about our giant number of nameless stranger students you see walking around campus besides madybe don't go Lori, who I've also meet in person at a football game and is pretty nice. Biddy could have called us childish and stupid for drunkenly throwing a bunch of snow powder at each other and dressing up like idiots but she complimented our creativity, energy, and our want to gather in such a big fun event on campus instead in a campus news video. This is always hard to find a way at a university as big as ours, but she found ways around it. 5 minutes of her time is pretty valuable I'm guessing, and she didn't hesitate spending it just on me. She went out to plenty of UW events and I know she must have done this at them some of the time. As you can tell this made an impression on me that most administration failed to do. 

Jump around was fun, don't get me wrong, but with the amount of times it was mentioned so the speakers could seem funny or cool, and it being in the last quarter instead of of at the end just made it tacky and awkward before and after. 

No name reading is somewhat understandable because of our size but they didn't do much to help it. Most of the  degree reading was in the painful format of insert name here. Then end had only four pictures stations for 7000 people, and then expected all of us to wait in line. What a joke. Why would I get a picture with one of those boring administrators anyway. Honestly I wish I could have invited my 4 favorite professors and TAs and have a picture with them, because they are the ones that made the occasional class go from the average semi boring experience to one where I would out of my way to make sure I was there even if I wasn't required. 

I did know two out of the three main student speakers actually from running into them working with the Union through Hoofers or class. They are restriced for what they can say obviously but the last two guys did well and ended up being a highlight. The first girl pretty much just introduced Jon Huntsman so there was not much improvise with, sometimes she gave pretty interesting opinions in class so I would have liked if she could have imprison her own speech. They were also all limited to the political science ASM crowd. (this is coming from an Econ Poli Sci major) There is so much more to our university and diversity than just that. 

Wanted to end on a high note though. An bad hour can't ruin how happy I was today or take away the hard work here. I visited Madison from my home without ever hearing that much about it and chose it as my dream school. I visited a lot of other places and was pretty disappointed honestly because I think I would have to travel out of the Midwest to find a place as cool as this to go to college. I worked my ass off to get in here by working on my bad test taking and raising my ACT from a 24 to a 31. I'm not trying to brag, I basically cheated the system by just getting do good at one test so I could get in here. The result? I loved it here socially and just the sprit if the town and university in general. Academically? I barely graduated. (don't worry still getting to the high note)  This school kicked my ass and i wasn't just average, as time went front on at the classes got harder I realized I was below average here. I came out with a 2.5 and I found out one of grades yesterday morning, a C meaning I could officially graduate. I'm not going to pretend like I was the hardest working student around, but when things got tough in harder classes I sacrificed a ton to be in the library making sure I would come out ok. My dad almost forced me to transfer my sophomore year because he was looking out for me, and I put my foot down and said I was going to prove him wrong and he trusted me on it. I was decently smart in high school and thought college would be hard but pretty reasonable achieved goal here, but it almost didn't happen. But I made it out, I've been hired for a job, and the whole time I was here this place just raising in United States rankings and appeal to everyone. People from my high school who didn't know of much about UW when I applied and raved about it a few years ago tell me I made a great decision and they regretted not considering it more. While I got pretty frustrated with the academics here and the bullshit I dealt with sometime the name recognition is really great and only improving. I'm lucky to not be graduating with a ton of debt so I know that can change people's opinions, if you are still job hunting after graduation keep hunting and trying to improve youself, because if they gave a fuck up like me one  it's not impossible. It's a tough world out there but I think so is Madison, unless you an absolute genius. I'm not going to say I made the greatest and closest friends here, my closest friends are still back in high school actually. What I did do is expand like crazy and meet so many amazing people. I joined a club that is honestly a little crazy with drinking but made this place feel like home. Somehow most of them managed to get As and Bs while doing their sport on a crazy high level for most of the year. I think the best thing that club gave me is not settling for something boring, because as someone who used to semi anti social and reserved, I now go back to see some old friends and people say I'm the one making thinks fun and interesting for them now. Badgers are damn tough little animals and Badgers students are honestly tough fun loving bastard who can make your world spin. Last thing I want to say is that at graduation was the first time I've even seen the student section empty. It was probably just how the sight lines of the stage was arranged, but I think the real ceremony was lacking is because one speaker got close but failed to hit it. Camp Randall is a fantastic place. People who have never watched football in their lives go stand in that student section just to be there with the crowd of fellow students. Alumni come back years after and get pissed if they can't find a student ticket. People have been chearing on the Badgers and athletes for years and years. They get recognized and they get all the publicity. I love sports but it's a damn shame the only people that get seriously recognized on campus and outside in media for our 3 biggest sports teams, high cost research few student touch, and the usual political activism about a county really far away from Wisconsin. Not trying to dismiss those great things or say we should think they aren't important, but that's only a very small part of us. ""Average"" Badgers have done some pretty fucking awesome things from drinking, being creative, starting or drastically improving their own student org that remains in Madison for the next 100 years, or making an impact on Madison  or wherever they end up. **The student section was empty because the real stars were on the field yesterday.** I love this place and I wish I could redo it honestly with a sheet of advice from senior me, but it wouldn't trade it for anything. 

With all that being said of being down on sports, screw Michigan State, Nebraska, Ohio State, and Minnesota. In that order.

For the sake of discussion, let’s assume the numbers work and I have a high quality local property manager.


What’s the general vibe like for living off campus now? When I was there, the administration was starting to force their hand at living on campus by requiring sophomores live in dorms. I’ve heard a lot about this new arch program and I’m wondering if that further discourages students from signing year-long off campus leases.

If the administration is doing what it can to keep students in university-owned housing, I might not bother with this property (unless there is a strong enough market for grad students).

Good off-campus property managers?,27,3,"I'm a local landlord and own several apartments that I rent to RPI students. I currently manage them myself but am looking to hire a property manager to handle the day-to-day management for me.

So, if you're a student living off campus near RPI and you have a property manager who is responsible and decent to deal with, I'd love to know his or her name. It's better for me and better for my tenants to have a manager who does what he promises, responds in a timely issue to building problems, etc.

In case it's not clear what ""property manager"" means, it's the person who typically is responsible for collecting rent, handling building maintenance and responding to any issues that arise with tenants. They may also be the person who helped you find the apartment, although sometimes that is done by separate people (""leasing agents""). In some cases (like mine, currently) the building owner is also the property manager and leasing agent, but many of the student rentals in this area are owned by out-of-town landlords who hire other people to do everything.",aao44r,RPI

RPI refuses housing scholarship to students moving off campus,7,8,"The office of financial aid hasn't officially stated this new policy, which would refuse housing scholarships to current sophomores and juniors moving off campus next year. This is another blow in the battle over housing reform at RPI and now many of the students who thought they could move off campus and get a meal plan covered under their housing scholarship will find that RPI is no longer considering your meal plan as part of your housing scholarship.

I personally think this is ridiculous since most students moving off campus next year have already done so under the belief that they would be able to keep their housing scholarship as long as they kept a meal plan.

A couple questions about RPI,41,25,"Hello, everyone! 

I'll be applying to RPI this season as a regular decision applicant, and I've heard it is an awesome STEM school. That being said, I have a couple questions about RPI in general. 

1) One of the biggest concerns is the cost of RPI-- close to 72k a year. How generous is RPI with merit aid? Around what scores should I have to qualify for a solid amount of merit aid(need based aid put aside)? 

2) What is the culture at RPI like? I'm aware that it's very academic oriented and so-called ""geeky"", which is great. I'm not really interested in greek life or partying, because I believe there are ways to have fun without partying. Are there enough activities on and off campus that do not involve partying, and are there other students here who share the same belief? 

3) How stressful is RPI? Coming from a cut-throat high school, I'd like to know about RPI's culture. I'm completely aware that as a stem school, RPI will be challenging in its academics. However, I'd also like to have a relatively healthy college experience. Could someone please elaborate on that? A balanced academic and student life balance would be good. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to address one or more of these questions! Your responses will greatly help!",dr1qzq,RPI

PSA to incoming / existing students; come hang downtown!,108,17,"Hey guys. I’m not an RPI student, but I lived off campus with a bunch of students when I first moved to Troy. I’ve since moved downtown and I’ve been here for about ten years.

I’ll cut right to the chase: don’t be scared of downtown! Troy has become a significantly different place since I’ve moved here. Downtown has exploded in terms of access, enjoyment, and walkability. I’ve heard all the stereotypes, and the fear, but I promise they’re unfounded.

Come explore before classes get too insane, and it gets cold. The city is beautiful this time of year. And now we have Uber / Lyft to get you back up the hill (believe me, it was a big deal).  Come to the farmers market before it heads inside for the season (its the best farmers market I’ve seen other than Union Square in NYC). Bring some friends and play games at Bard and Baker. Hungry? We’ve got bbq, halal, Indian, poke, sushi, vegan, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, just about goddamn everything. The architecture and history of this city is incredible.

I grew up in suburban NJ. The “everyone on your block knows your name, lawnmowers start at 6am”, suburban life. I wasn’t a ‘city guy’. As long as you’re smart (walk with a friend late night, walk with a purpose, etc.), you have nothing to worry about and so much to gain. 

TL:DR; Troy is a gem of a city, I love it, and if you don’t explore it while you’re here, you’re seriously missing out. Experience it before your lives get insane. PM me or comment with any questions, I’m more than happy to help.",cx45wa,RPI
It isn't personal,27,6,"Sea story time folks. And as all good sea stories go, this is a no shitter. 


In the beginning, there was Rickover. He was by all accounts a singular human being. At any given time, he was either the vendor and contractor or he was the government oversight of all things naval nuclear power.  He said ""let there be light"", and Cherenkov responded ""I gotchu fam"". 

Time passed. A couple seemingly unrelated events mated up with some weak training, and oops. We slagged some fuel in a live reactor.  This was generally considered not a good day. 

The attitude towards nuclear took a hit. Students enrolling in nuke eng dropped off so bad, that the MANE, such as it was, almost got a haircut. Would have been the MAE. Which honestly, just sounds like a thin veil for a not so popular student loan government entity.  There was no rejoicing. 

But the head MANE guy at the time, we shall call him PSki, was no fool. He knew the Navy had some prototypes nearby, and a handful of questionably talented people with that sweet, sweet GI Bill money. So, with that insight, he stuck a deal with the naby folks. Trimester full year education at an off campus location. 21 credits a semester.  Pay a visit the the Linac a couple times, do some of the Rad Eng surveys for them and disguise it as a graded lab. Boom. Degree. He saved the Nuclear branch. 

Then? Well then a someone with a talent for high salaries (but just off the top 5 list) ascended. And, probably rightfully, began to take a disliking to this sidebar program. Our little group wasn't exactly a breeding ground of philanthropists.  Okay, fine. But she concluded that we didn't donate because we weren't on campus. And she ""didn't want our hundred bucks a month, she wanted a hundred million, once."" Ergo, combined with rising rumors of integrity issues (there is some validity to that, working 56 hours a week on rotating shiftwork while trying to bang out a degree  or two is a breeding ground  for innovative study techniques). Plus, nuclear was on the upswing on its pending renaissance, traditional enrollment had never been stronger. 
Short story long, she pulled the plug and the Navy nukes got nuked. RIP. 

And that's okay. It's a business decision. 

But.

It stings to have a lost legacy. And it's always refreshed when you guys have to do the call arounds for cash.  You're doing your thing, and you all have been a joy to chat with. But getting us to donate when our program was discarded is a tough sell. The icing on the cake is this. The part in quotes from above, that was a direct report from one of our very well meaning professors who probably shouldn't have shared it with us, after the decision was made. 


Not trying to change any minds. Not even complaining really. Just adding a footnote to the day to day grind for anyone who cares to read it. 


PS: this also goes out to that one young lady in 08 who, right up to the very day of graduation, thought she was *the it girl* and had no idea who we were. She challenged our (our in this case can be defined as a bunch of sleep deprived mostly combat veterans fluent in verbal evisceration and whiskey) presence, and not exactly in a tasteful way. I won't share what was said to her, suffice it to say she was adequately flustered to the point of leaving her seat until it was our row's turn to walk.   Oops.

first year living off-campus and feeling overwhelmed,26,12,"hello! i'm a first year student at mcgill and eager to start uni. unfortunately, i've been feeling overwhelmed by the drinking x party culture here (esp. in the faculty of management). i am definitely a light weight, so i rarely drink. on top of all that, everyone seems to have friends from high school or joined a group in the first few days or so. 

a new city equals a new experience and i honestly cannot wait. the only downsides are the homesickness and loneliness i feel. i honestly feel embarrassed to feel this way because i used to be very extroverted, however i feel so shy now. as valedictorian and after taking on executive club roles in high school, i've never had trouble making friends before. i've started to question whether i fit in this type of environment or if i'm overreacting. in my old school, everyone was the gamer x sports x academic type, so i'm not quite sure how to integrate myself. it is also a culture shock for me because my environment used to be primarily asian-based (which i associate with) compared to so multicultural.

I’m in the process of convincing my parents to let me attend Sciences Frosh, hoping that it would give me the opportunity to meet people and make new friends, but they’re worried knowing that there will be a couple of night events. I’m also kind of nervous because all of my friends will be attending their own faculty frosh so I’ll be alone for this one, if allowed to go :( I’ll also be underage during Frosh so I won’t be able to drink, but I think I can still have fun without the alcohol. If allowed to attend Frosh, despite being underage, would those who are 18+ and are drinking be interested in being friends? Strange question, but I’m an over-thinker haha.

Also, my parents and my aunt aren’t really fond of the idea of participating in anything that won’t benefit my education aka parties and any unnecessary clubs, despite my interest. Throughout high school, I always skipped out on all of the parties and sports games to focus on my studies, but it was always something I regretted doing. So, to make up for it, I’ve been attending more parties with my friends and cherishing all the good times we had this past summer. With that being said, I found that I enjoyed partying and my friend is also on the McGill Football team so I’m really hoping I will be able to find a way to go out to a few parties and attend some games. I don’t really want to repeat the same mistake I made back in high school. 

Also, are same/opposite gender sleepovers allowed at  McGill res? I am serious about my education, but I do want to live my life a little and enjoy my first year at McGill with my friends. 

Any tips on how to make my time at frosh an enjoyable one, where to meet new friends and on how to convince my aunt to let me stay out/sleepover at times would be extremely useful!",cpp3k5,mcgill

McGill Proxy Bookmarklet - a bookmarklet I made to easily access journal articles (or other restricted/paywalled sited) from off-campus,18,8,"\*sites (typo in title)

&#x200B;

Hi everyone.

&#x200B;

I often find myself off-campus and needing to read lots of journal articles which are behind a paywall, so I made this bookmarklet to simply access to these articles down to the click of a button!

&#x200B;

**Who is this for?**

* If you usually find yourself outside of the McGill wifi network and don't use the VPN (which can be a pain to log into every time) or don't like going through the McGill library website to get full access to articles each time, then this is for you!

**How do I use it?**

* After having setup the bookmarklet (see below), simply click it any time you are on a site which requires login to view the full-length article, you will then be brought to McGill's site and prompted to log in with your email/password\*
* Example article: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0288-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0288-7)
   * Normally Nature only lets you read the abstract for free - just load up the site and click the bookmarklet, you will be redirected to the McGill login system and then brought back to the publisher's site with access to the full article, PDF export, figures, etc.

\*you only need to log in once per browser session, so upon loading a subsequent article which requires paid access, clicking the bookmarklet should immediately open the full article.

&#x200B;

**How can I install it?**

*(only tested on Chrome, if you use another browser and it works please comment and I'll update this post!, should theoretically work on all browsers...)*

*(not tested on mobile devices)*

* Simply create a new bookmark, name it whatever you like (I called mine ""Proxy"") and set the URL to:

&#x200B;

    javascript:void(location.href=""https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=""+location.href);

"Experiences with Evo, Parc Cite, Edison? (off campus student housing)",10,58,"Hi guys,

I'm an incoming international freshman considering living off campus because on campus rez is crazy expensive :(

I figured living in an organized third-party student rez like evo/parc cite/la marq/etc was a good option instead of renting an apartment in my first year since I've never been to montreal and I know nothing about the city.


Has anyone here lived in these places? 

I have some questions:

1) How was your experience? Would you recommend it to someone as an alternative to on campus housing?

2) How much did you pay? Was it worth it?

3) Did you cook for yourself all the time or get a meal plan?

4) Are there any rooms with kitchens included?

5) I've heard about evo and parc cite online but has anyone here lived in Edison Residence? How was your experience? It looks like a new place to me

Any first-year student planning to live off campus in the fall?,2,4,"I just cancelled my residence at Solin Hall.

I have always enjoyed partying and I am afraid it might be much harder to fit in if I don't live in rez. I have been looking at reviews about the ghetto as well as Plateau, it seems like ghetto might be a good fit for me since I am looking for a place within the mcgill bubble, at least for now. I was just wondering what the atmosphere is like in the ghetto area and how the party scenes are? Also will there be a lot of first years living there? Any advice from upper class or any comment will be greatly appreciated. Also do you have any great resources to look for apartments in the ghetto?

idk if mcgill is for me,71,53,"I come from a family that is very average, financially. We’re not rich, but we’re not poor either. Sending me to McGill was a big decision that definitely changed all of that, especially now because my family is in the process of moving houses. Like many of you, McGill was my first choice, so when I found out I was admitted, I practically begged my parents to let me attend here. They were completely against it for the longest time, especially since I am the youngest of my siblings, and they didn’t let either of them study out of province either. I basically spent my entire grade 12 year trying to convince them to say yes, and they eventually gave in near the end of my year and said yes.

Now, I am currently paying my tuition through student loans and am living off-campus with a relative. I wanted to live on rez to make friends but my parents completely cut that option out since it’s too expensive, so now I commute 40 minutes everyday to get to school.

Here’s the problem: I’m doing absolutely terrible in my academics right now. I failed one of my midterms, barely passed two of them, and did decent on the other two. Having done 2 finals so far, I feel like I may have failed my math 139 final, but hopefully the mark is not too low where I fail the course entirely. I still have two more finals, which I am deathly scared for and feel quite unprepared (yet here I am, ranting rather than studying for them lol). Similar to pretty much all McGill students, I scored very high in high school, which was one of the convincing factors to attain my parents’ trust to come study here. They have a lot of hope in me, which I am glad to hear, but it’s so stressful to hear it all the time. My mom, basically everyday would always tell me, personally, that she expects the most from me out of all of my siblings, and even more now because I was the only one allowed to leave the province to study.

Some more background info: Living off-campus affected me a lot. In high school, I was used to being surrounded by a group of friends every single day. Coming to McGill, I knew it would be slightly harder to make friends since I was not on rez, but I tried to think positive. I attended frosh but everyone in my frosh group were exchange students who were in their 20s and kept brushing me off whenever I tried to make a connection (I was 17). Then, I introduced myself to so many people in classes, labs, tutorials, etc. but it seemed as though everyone I met lived on rez and whenever they found out I was off-campus, they would sort of falter and find someone else to talk to. We would have great conversations, and then, as soon as they find out I’m off campus, they wouldn’t talk to me as much.

Being used to constantly being around people back in high school to barely talking to anyone took a big hit on my mental state. I eat lunch by myself everyday, alone and go to classes without anyone to talk to. Although it may not sound like a drastic problem compared to what others have to go through, but for me, it was a huge change and is still something I struggle to adapt with. Spending my 18th here, alone, was quite lonesome, especially because my relative wasn’t at home with me either.

I’d go weeks without having anyone to talk to and it kind of put me into a depressed mental state. And now, it seems like everyone already has their own, group of friends and aren’t as open to meeting new people as they were during the beginning of the semester.

I told my parents about my situation and they brushed it off, saying that this should help me get extremely good marks since I wouldn’t have any “distractions”, when in reality, having no friends was my distraction. It lead me to feel very depressed and insecure with myself, to the point where I started developing an unhealthy eating pattern. There would be days where I binge eat, and continue eating even though I could physically feel myself about to explode, and there would be days where I would barely eat anything. Sometimes I would just drink water and call it a day, and the entire process would repeat itself, over and over again.

I feel like having no friends was the sole reason as to why I’m doing so poorly in my academics. It lead me to being unmotivated to do anything. I will admit, some of the material that we have learnt is quite difficult, but had I been the same person I was back in high school, I would have continued to rigor through until I understood the content, but now, I’ve lost all of my motivation to even try. I began to be very behind in my courses, and thus lead to a terrible semester. I still never told my parents my midterm results, I’m too afraid to let them down. To make matters worse, I have dreams to go into medicine and I understand that this will definitely make my application not stand out compared to other applicants. My mom constantly mentions that I should come home and study there, but I’m unsure as to what I want anymore.

I want to stay at McGill because I was planning on staying with my relative for another year until I’ve saved enough to move out and really start on my life by myself, but if I were to go back home, my parents wouldn’t let me move out until I finish my degree, whether I have enough to move out or not. They’re sweet and protective, and I love them for that, but it gets quite overbearing, especially now when my mom expects me to facetime her every night, and when I call her an hour later than I normally do, she would start yelling at me. She always tells me to make sure I am home, latest, 9PM every night and that she doesn’t ever want me partying or going out for a small drink.

Now taking these factors into consideration, I don’t know if I should stay at McGill and complete my degree here or transfer to the university in my province for my 2nd year. I feel like I’m wasting so much money studying here because I am not doing well, academically, mentally and physically. If I go back home, I know I will be happier because my friends are there, but at the same time, I don’t think I will ever be able to feel proud of myself for not being able to stick it through. But again, I’m scared of failing and wasting so much money and time here if I am not going to be able to be successful in the end.

Sorry for ranting so long, I just really wanted to get this off my chest and get some good advice. :)",e9itv5,mcgill
2020 MEGATHREAD: Prospective and Incoming Student Questions (All Other Posts Will Be REMOVED),22,148,"Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please **read the FAQs below**, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to [Service Point](https://www.mcgill.ca/servicepoint).

You might also try asking your question [here](http://ask.mcgill.ca) on the McGill website.

***

**What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?** 

We can't tell you for sure because we're not admissions officers, but in general, offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the [minimum requirements](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements) for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the sooner you're likely to hear back.

***

**If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?**

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

***

**What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?**

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

***

**Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?**

Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

***

**How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.**

It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades up or down so that there's a certain average (aka ""grade deflation""). 

***

**What is student life like?**

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. [Read through some past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/search?q=life&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

***

**Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?**

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.",e2ayzz,mcgill

Taking less than 15 credits as an Engineering student?,2,4,"I'm finalizing my schedule rn and I have a few questions. Im going into Software Eng U2 ([curriculum](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/files/ece/se_7_2018-2019.pdf)).

&#x200B;

I'm pretty on track with the curriculum so far with 2 differences:

1. I didn't take ECSE 223 (Model-Based)  in Winter 2019, and I haven't taken it yet (all seats were taken by the time i registered).
2. I took CCOM 206 this Summer 2019 instead of taking it in Winter 2020 (its a time consuming essay class).

&#x200B;

Im planning on taking ECSE 223 this year because its a prereq. for some 3rd year classes. Im thinking of doing it Winter semester because its a ""team project"" type class, of which I have 4 planned next year, so I want to split them 2-2 over both semesters so that I don't get overwhelmed.

I also didn't manage to get any of the Natural Science Complementary's that I wanted, so I was thinking of postponing them til later (see [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/cwtbfm/saving_an_elective_for_later/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)), instead of doing them this year.

&#x200B;

So that leaves me with 13 credits in Fall, and 15 credits in Winter. And I deviate from the curriculum again twice:

1. Not taking the Natural Science Complementary in Fall 2019, instead postponing it.

My questions are:

Is 13 credits too little in a semester? Should I be taking 3rd year classes to fill up my schedule?

Also, does everything look good for the schedule or is there something I overlooked? Are there some classes that are better to take in another semester because of different professors, etc?

What do you do when therapy and meds aren't working?,22,9,"Hey guys, so idk if this is a place to ask these kinds of questions, but i really don't know what to do anymore... Over the last 3 years, I've seen 4 different counsellors, both at McGill counselling services and at clinics off-campus, and therapy sessions have done nothing but make me feel even worse (even though the counsellors were nice people though). I've also tried different meds, but the horrible side effects were so unbearable and always made my symptoms worse than they were at the start. I would feel so sick that I would vomit, sweat and shake all day, unable to sleep or eat at all. I am limited in the meds that I can take for mental health issues because I am also currently taking other meds that may intefere with antidepressants. The thing is, I've actually put in a ton of effort in getting better: I followed my counsellors' advice, did the ""homework"" they gave me, changed my lifestyle and literally pushed myself out of my bubble and tried new things, but somehow it's just not working. I also tried yoga, meditation and going to the gym more often until I figured it really wasn't my thing. I also tried joining clubs, but I have serious issues connecting with people in general. Last semester things were so bad, I withdrew from classes, barely passed the 2 that I ended up taking and nearly dropped out. I need to get my shit together, and I've tried so hard, but it's just getting worse and worse everyday and idk what to do anymore. Is there anything other than what I've already tried, that could potentially make me not dread getting out of bed every morning? 

&#x200B;

To give you an idea of what's happening to me without going into details: The last couple of years, people have done terrible things to me that have ruined my life/career, I made bad decisions and now i can't go back, and got injured in an accident that changed my life entirely. That led me to become angry all the time. Amidst all my struggles, there are indeed things that I have never told any counsellor or doctor because that is very sensitive information that I just can't tell. I know I have trouble trusting people in general, but the last time I trusted someone that I trusted dearly, I literally lost everything. I've also been used, scammed and lied to that I can't even trust ""professionals"" anymore. I'm desperate to find a way out -.-",c4tcrs,mcgill
Transfer student coming to McGill- residence or downtown apartment?,2,24,"I’m transferring in to Arts this fall (coming from a Uni in the US) and am starting to look at housing options for the entire school year starting in the last week of August. I just received an email from McGill saying that I was chosen from the lottery and have a place available in a residence hall on campus. I also have the option to request and be placed in Solin Hall. 

I am leaning towards seeking out a place to live off campus in an apartment with other McGill students. I lived in a residence hall in the US and the experience was okay; I liked being surrounded by many other students but I think I’d rather have my own place with a kitchen and fewer roommates. I do not know anyone in Montreal or McGill so I’m starting completely fresh. I’ve done this in the past living in France by myself and New Hampshire, so I’m not too worried about making new friends (I know it’ll take time). 

If anyone has some insight on residence vs. apartments and maybe a couple forums where I could find McGill students to live with that would be great! I’m also not planning on getting a meal plan either way (heard it was very overpriced and there are many options to eat out in Montreal). 

Thank you in advance :)",c3pjxp,mcgill
McGill Residences - Gendered Bathrooms,1,11,"Hi Guys!! I'm a BA student (U1) coming to McGill next year and I'm not really comfortable with mixed gender shared bathrooms. What are the chances that I'll be able to get a residence that has gendered bathrooms? Can I share this preference at some point when getting residence? If it's completely random, then how unsafe is it living off campus in comparison to living on rez? I've heard off-campus is cheaper and I also don't really have much trouble socializing so I don't have any of the usual concerns - safety is my biggest priority.

Thank you in advance!!!",bqr3dn,mcgill
Tips for First Years and Living Costs,13,32,"Hey everyone,

So I'm planning on applying and going to McGill as my first choice university and am not too worried about being admitted. Given that, I am worried about living as both my savings and what my parents can afford are little. I know there  are places I can apply for scholarships, loans, etc. However, I'm very anxious that due to not having that much money available to my name, I won't be able to study at McGill and afford it for the first year. I also plan on living with roommates off-campus due to residence being extremely expensive. Please correct me if I seem misinformed and ignorant.

If there are any tips it would be much appreciated, thank you.",abnnxw,mcgill

How does one get Wi-Fi on their android phone?,1,13,"Serious question, I used my mail.mcgill account and for some reason it won't allow me to connect. Phone is a Google Pixel 1. 

Using MTL-WiFi when I get off campus isn't fulfilling my first world needs and I can't text shorties on tinder during class :( ",agok68,mcgill
How does your schedule look like when all your classes are recorded?,7,4,"All my classes this semester are recorded, which is a huge blessing. I learn much better from recordings because I stay focused and motivated, and in some cases, I end up spending less time on lectures just by putting the prof on x1.5. I've made an alternative schedule for myself (i.e. a schedule of when to watch my lectures) to keep myself on track and to create some semblance of a routine.

However, this basically removes all incentive for me to be on campus. While I am involved in clubs and will be on campus for exec/lab meetings, events, and to work in the library before/afterwards, I find that its a rather isolating cycle; watch lectures, study, club/lab meetings, repeat. As someone who doesn't have a large social capital, I find it rather hard to meet new people regardless of whether I am physically on/off campus, but even more so now as I am exposed to less people per day. Also, most of my friends are graduating this semester. What can I do? Thanks!",ae79gh,mcgill
I’m bored and sad,13,7,"   It’s my first year, and I didn’t join any clubs this term, but I want to next term because I need to find friends. Lacking friends is really affecting my life so I have to start trying to go out and stuff. Any suggested clubs? I don’t really have a hobby, I don’t play any instruments, my singing is average, and I’m not good at any sports. I’m not that depressing in person though lol

   I really like going out, partying, drinking, and I also like chill activities, but I’m really introverted and bad at talking to people when I’m alone. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and had a lot of trouble because of that, but it’s manageable once I have a couple of people with me (and it certainly helps to be drunk). 

   My high school friends who are in the US are fine. They instantly made a group of friends, they go out, and they seem to have lots of opportunities to make friends. So I guess I’m also just upset that I’m suddenly left out. Moving to a different country with lots of French also made me feel terrified. 

   Honestly being in a place like mcgill where there are tons of people and being alone makes it even more difficult to be myself. I’m scared to go outside, I miss a lot of classes, I’m scared to talk to people. I missed orientation week so I feel that it’s too late to start making friends. I also live off campus. I’ve tried talking to people in my class in the beginning of the semester, but I never clicked with anyone, and frankly I never saw them again. I just want a couple of people that I can go out or hang out with. Did any of you have this kind of experience in your first year or no? Is this normal or did I mess up already?

Just some Questions.,0,4,"So I’m an American student, and I visited McGill in October, and I have to say, I was amazed. I’m a high school sophomore pulling about a 92-94 average. It’s by far my #1 choice but I have a few questions that the tour didn’t necessarily answer.

1) The website says an Arts degree for international is ~28,000 and a Law is similar. Is that accurate? I can’t afford more than like 30,000
2)is it easy to make friends (sounds dumb but for off campus housing I wanna be able to split the bill lmao)
3)is the education as good as the schools ranking says
4) is it generally worth it to go there?
5) also if I don’t get a scholarship can I still get into Douglass (hall?) it was so nice!!!! 
6) and how hard is it to get a scholarship? 

Any other tidbits of information would really help me. Thanks!",7ivxvi,mcgill
What is McGill's responsibility to mental health? Are they required to provide a certain standard of care?,29,74,"I was having this conversation with my friends, and there is a lot of talk on campus about how McGill doesn't do enough for mental health, and that it needs to do more. I was wondering, because I genuinely don't know: what is McGill's responsibility here? Are they obligated to provide a certain standard of mental health services? 

Because technically they are just an educational/research institution, and I guess I would assume they don't *have* to provide any mental healthcare, but they provide it anyway. I'm not  sure if it's because they have to or because it's considered an amenity? Has McGill promised a certain standard and they're not delivering on it? Or do people just think they *should* do more? What are McGills obligations to mental health as opposed to going to off-campus mental health services? I am confused and don't know.

I'm not trying to be controversial or offensive, it is a genuine question have because I'm not really sure.",8eifri,mcgill
"""Cozier"" event spaces on/near campus?",10,11,"Hey everyone -

So I've involved with several groups on campus that are trying to organize fun, smaller-scale, cozier events (movie screenings, ""listening groups"" for a music-appreciation club) but I'm not familiar with places on campus that lend themselves well to that? (Or spaces off campus that allow bookings for free?) So I was wondering whether any of you have come across such a space - I'm imagining capacity of 20-ish, and you're allowed to bring snacks, and cozy decor rather than blank white walls...

November McGill Senators AMA,10,9,"Hey everyone! We’re the SSMU senators for this year, back to answer your questions about McGill policies, especially the academic ones. 

As SSMU senators, we currently sit at McGill senate (monthly), along with seats on various McGill committees. For the Month of November, we want to highlight some topics going to Senate today, Thursday November 23rd for discussion: 

The *McGill Wellness Strategy* is being developed by Student Services to improve mental health on campus. The strategy aims to improve physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health as they are all components to maintaining health overall! The passing of this strategy will lead to a new office under the University’s Provost, and appointed staff who would help different units develop their own policies and practices that foster overall wellness in their smaller community.
 
The *McGill Context* is being revised in order to inform the revisions happening for the Code of Student Conduct this year. It dictates which situations the code can apply to. The revisions widen the scope of the policy from covering McGill sponsored events and incidents on campus, to off campus violations that compromise the well-being or success of community members as well.  

The *McGill Climate and Sustainability Action Plan* highlights the future short-term goals and steps towards the university's long-term goal of carbon neutrality. Current emission rates are discussed. The University outlines 22 priority actions on achieving their short term climate and sustainability goals over the next 3 years. 

The *Annual Report of the Committee on Enrollment and Student Affairs* highlights multiple changes in the faculty of continuing studies. GPA requirements are officially set at 3.0 over 4 years or over a 3.2 in your last 2. Dental aptitude test requirement was also approved for the faculty of dentistry.

Interested students are also allowed to email AVEQ directly for questions at interne@aveq-nous.ca. Thanks for all of the questions! 

The Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec, (AVEQ) is a provincial student association that brings together student unions from across Quebec. These associations have historically been successful in advocating for a strong financial aid system, student work opportunities off campus, the regulation of university fees, and more - all making education more accessible. 

From March 16th - 18th, students will be able to vote as to whether or not to affiliate to AVEQ. The cost to affiliate is $3.50 per student per semester (budget information here: http://aveq-nous.ca/finances/?lang=en). By affiliating, we will be able to have our voices heard at the provincial and federal levels, something we can't do with SSMU alone.

Graduating Students: What are you going to miss/not miss about McGill?,24,18,"Congratulations Class of 2015!

**Loved**:

-first year in upper rez and the PBR-soaked memories it provided, as well as the opportunity to exponentially expand my social circle

-the work ethic attained by constantly being surrounded by bright and hardworking students (the number of people I know who have been accepted to med/law/grad schools, or work at companies like Deloitte, Google, etc. is insane), and the rewarding feeling when you do well in a competitive environment

-the endless number of extracurricular and research opportunities on and off campus

-camping this subreddit

-the pasta bar at RVC and flirting with the Jamaican caf ladies

-watching horror movies like the CHEM 222 final at the cineplex

**Hated**:

-administrative bureaucracy and chaos ie. the MUNACA strike in my first month at McGill

-the abysmal service at the Sherbrooke/University Tim Hortons and the closure of the Redpath Tim Hortons

-Political Correctness and ""Microaggressions""

-SSMU politics

-Inhumanly shitty exam schedules (3 exams in 24 hours is a conflict, but 3 exams in 27 hours isn't??? what the actual fuck???)",37fi83,mcgill

* an applicant or a new student to McGill, then most of your questions can probably be answered [here](http://unofficialmcgillguide.com/) or by searching [here](http://www.google.com/) and your life will be made better by reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/skqfc/any_interest_in_compiling_a_list_of_mcgill_life/).

* an new student wondering about rez, please stop posting new threads and just look at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1g11od/the_catch_all_thread_about_mcgill_residences/).

* looking for advice on a course, then you can usually get a good idea of its content by searching for the course code [here](http://www.docuum.com/) or [here](http://www.wikinotes.ca/).

* worried you are going to fail a course, fail out of school, or going through an emotionally difficult time, you can find help with McGill's Counselling Service [here](http://www.mcgill.ca/counselling/). Remember that there are infinite solutions to a problem (except in math) but cheating, plagirism, and suicide are not.

First year not living on res?,5,18,"Hello friends. 
I will be starting at McGill in the fall and deadline for residence is in a few days. I'm leaning toward living off campus for a number of reasons, mainly to save money. I have no problem with cooking my own food, in fact I'd prefer it to a meal plan, or living independently without the social experience of res. I've already perused through the ads in the mcgill classifeds and offcampus listings and read the guide. 

My main concerns are the inconvenience (finding a place, possibly commuting, other financial logistics), and difficultly of finding friends who will actually want to do stuff because it seems like your friends first year are the people in your res out of proximity/convenience.

Basically, if anyone has lived off campus first year, could you please share your experience? How easy was it to find a room and when did you start looking/visit? Ideally I'd want to rent a room in an apartment already occupied by upper year McGillians but I feel like many would be hesitant to have a first-year around. Also, how important is living within walking distance to campus vs. rent?

Any advice/insight is highly appreciated!",26z8nh,mcgill

* I have an anticipated average of 94%. It's barely second term but I've taken most of my grade 12 courses. Is this realistically competitive? I'm hoping to major in English Literature or Linguistics.
* Could any English Literature or Linguistics majors comment on how they feel about the program and why they chose it in the first place?
* I'm a bassoonist. Is there a student band, orchestra or wind ensemble I could get involved in without being a music major? I don't actually own a bassoon.
* Is there any affordable off-campus housing? Is it incredibly difficult to find/worth looking for?
* I speak barely any French. Is it possible to get by in Montreal without it?
* Are scholarships ridiculously difficult to get? Does McGill have automatic entrance scholarships?

I'm looking for some answers as far as what I would expect in either the shared or apartment style residence living situations - for those who have lived there or generally just know more than what the website says.  Any information is helpful! 

--What are the conditions of the grad residences? (I've lived in worn out, old houses before while at school, so I'm not picky, just curious).

--As far as shared residence, what are the layout of the houses like? The website simply states that all rooms are single and that the kitchen is shared.  (ie. one of the residences says it houses 15 female grad students on three floors. It says nothing about the number of bathrooms or anything.  For all I know these 15 girls are sharing two bathrooms between all of them). 

--Closeness of grocery stores, general amenities, etc. (is it ultimately more convenient to be in walking distance or bus distance of the campus?)

--Essentially anything else anyone might know about grad housing because I've got very little to go on!



*I've decided to go the residence route for my first year because I live a little too far away from Montreal to just head up for a day to check out some places to live.  Not only is it a little intimidating finding a place in a city that I'm not familiar with but I'm in need of a place that is furnished.  I'm sure there are places I could find to live that are cheaper than residence but its seeming like the residence option will be a little easier on me (however, that's totally up for argument if people have any advice to offer or know of good places to live off-campus!).  I'm considering the studio apartment options because the cost of them is slightly cheaper in some cases than the more expensive rooms in the shared facilities.  A price range is given online for the shared residences (I'm assuming it's because of different size rooms) and the higher end of the range for some of them is around the same price as the studio apartment options.*

I'm transferring to McGill this semester from a U.S. university, and I need help finding a roommate! I've been having trouble finding anything, so I thought I'd try asking you guys for some help. Thus far I've been using craigslist and the McGill off-campus housing listings. If any of you are looking for a roommate, know anyone who's looking for a roommate, or have any tips for me on how to find something (preferably something close to McGill), I would appreciate your help!  

About me: I'll be a 3rd year, 20 year-old Linguistics student at McGill. I'm passionate about the subject and about learning in general. I take my studies seriously, but I still like to hang out. I've got a good sense of humor and love to laugh and socialize. I love literature and I try to read when I can. I also have a passion for music (although that's not much of a distinguishing characteristic), and I spend a big chunk of my time listening to music or playing it (I play violin/fiddle). I like watching movies, playing video games, and riding my bike, and I love to hang out with friends. I'm very respectful of others and of shared spaces. I don't speak French, but I love learning languages, and so I have every intention of learning French while I'm at McGill. I'm also near-fluent in Spanish, so in a pinch I can figure out the gist of a French phrase. There's one big deal breaker for me in a roommate: owning a cat. I love them, but I'm allergic. :| 

Anyway, if there's anything you guys can do to help, I would appreciate it more than you could know. Also, messages are appreciated when convenient. Thanks in advance! :)

First Year American Student Questions,0,5,"Hi McGill students,

I have a few questions for you seasoned veterans of Montreal, any help would be very appreciated.

I'm entering McGill as a First Year Arts (IDS) student from the States next year, and I'm not sure if I'll be U1 or U0. I'll know in July when my AP scores come back. The general response I've heard is that someone in my situation should register for U1 classes (skip any pre-reqs, FYS) and then change during Add/Drop. Is that congruous with your experiences? What if there is an FYS I want to take--I know they're ""open to U1 as well as U0"" students but do any U1 folks REALLY take them? (PSYC 199 has nothing to do with my intended major but it's really interesting to me...)

But a different question about that--if I do enter as a U1 student, is it possible to take fewer classes each year and graduate in 4 years as opposed to 3? That seems like a really attractive option to me, assuming it is one.

Lastly, I've heard it's very difficult to get a job off-campus without fluency in French. I speak Spanish and can read French pretty well, as well as understand bits of it. However, I can't speak it very well at all, and the Community College class I was going to take over the summer got canceled...Does anyone have any experience with student job-hunting as someone who only really speaks English?

"For the Freshmen class of 2014, a breakdown of the residence system",2,1,"Upper Rez aka: BMH - Dorm style residences. Functionally speaking, they are all the same and offer students the traditional aspects of college life. For some reason, Molson, year in and year out seems to garner the reputation for being the hardest partiers. This residence is located way up the hill and is quite isolated from your basic amenities. Security here is lax so you can get away with quite a bit. Molson used to have this giant beerbong that had a pipe that went down five floors. Dunno if it still exists but it used to be a bit of a tradition. 

New Rez - The biggest residence at McGill. It has a reputation for being wild and party hardy which is well deserved. This is basically a hotel which is good and bad. Good in that you get nice rooms and your close to all the amenities but bad in that you get little privacy in your room since most the beds are next to one another. In other words, expect to get sexed out (or be the one doing the sexing out) a lot. One year, New Rez had more than 50% of its students on academic probation. Year in and year out , has the highest number of one year wonders (kids who drop out after a year) at McGill. Why? Because it is understaffed, large and impossible to control. Lots of parties go on here on a nightly basis and it's very hard to study in that type of environment. If you are easily distracted and have issues folding to peer pressure, avoid this residence if you want to do well academically. Fun fact, when McGill first bought New Residence it was a 4 star hotel. Today it's a 2 star hotel. Seven years of 18 year olds abusing it on a nightly basis will do that to a building. 

Carrefour Sherbrooke - Functionally the same as New Rez. Pretty much the opposite of New Rez in culture. It has a reputation for being strict on rules and quiet and is not understaffed like New Rez. In fact, students often will come here to study. If you are a music student, this residence is especially convenient because the music building and library are right down the street. So the cons? This residence basically babysits you. Unlike the other residences where you're given quite a bit of free reign and some degree of respect as adults, this residence has strict regulations on noise, alcohol and imposes noise curfews on weeknights. 

RVC - Another residence that is convenient for music students because of it's proximity to the music buildings. RVC has dorm style rooms and is considered to have the best cafeteria on campus. Cons? No real cons; dorms are a bit small but you're not paying for awesome buildings if you're planning to live on campus. If that is the case, I wouldn't recommend a single one. 

MORE Houses - You know that TV show the Real World on MTV? The MORE Houses are basically that. A bunch of people in one house sharing it. For obvious reasons, this can create a lot of issues as a group that large sharing a house will have personalities that clash. Additionally, these residences are spread across campus and unlike the residences I've already mentioned - do not have ANY support staff on site. Could be a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about being supervised at 18. 

Greenbriar - Technically considered to be a part of MORE houses but it's different enough that it warrants its own entry. Basically an apartment building on campus. Like MORE houses, they are not supervised so depending on your floormates, it can be a wildcard. 

Prez Rez - I have very little info on this residence. Sorry.

Solin Hall - This is a love it or hate it residence. Quite unique in that it's located relatively far off campus - you have to take a bus, car or the metro (subway) to get to school. Because it's located so far off campus, you do not get a meal plan. Instead you get a kitchen and are expected to make food on your own. That said, in terms of living accommodations, this is the only residence that I would deem suitable for a normal human being to live in. Large living spaces, big windows, high ceilings, private bathrooms and private bedrooms make it very nice to live. The distance factor may turn you off however.",p1rjb,mcgill

in december i got the courage to ask for help from one the counselors on campus and after venting for ages she basically told me i needed to seek help outside of what ucd offers. i had never been able to talk to a counselor about my mental health before and it was a big deal for me to actually do it, i was shaking the whole rest of the day. problem is she sent me a referral but told me to call local mental health places and ask if theyre taking patients and my anxiety wont let me do that. this whole quarter ive tried to get myself to start calling but i cant bring myself to its nerve wracking. i hate that i must bring the courage to open up like that again and again and every time i know it will be a struggle and i worry i will take years before i can do it again.


i dont know where to start calling, or what places take SHIP, or what places do 1 on 1 sessions, or what places might help me get meds for this shit vs just talking to me, or what doctors have experience with what id need to talk to them about (depression, anxiety, selfharm, suicidal ideation, disordered eating, domestic abuse, and more... lol fuck what a MESS).

I got a bunch of money from grants and after paying tuition have around $9k left over before books, transportation, housing/food, etc. so I wanted to stretch it as far as I could.  To this end I was looking into off-campus housing since it seemed much cheaper than the residence halls or SHA.  But then I found this post that claimed you got more money if you went with SHA, from /u/xthrowawayx9001:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/6uuoc7/im_an_idiot_who_hasnt_found_housing_yet_is_ramble/dm1z2jt/

To quote this post:

>The cost of rent is drastically reduced in your cost of attendance if you're designated as ""off campus"", so your aid package is lowered. All of the apartments in SHA count as ""on campus"" even though they're private apartment complexes being leased through partnership the school. If you have a good financial aid package then SHA isn't anymore expensive than doing your own lease due to this, and carries benefits like living in an apartment complex full of transfer students similar to you, roommate matching, and also being able to access all of the resident facilities on campus that the dorm students have access to if you want to.

>If your financial aid package is low or non-existent then SHA is more expensive than doing the lease yourself.

Is it true that your financial aid will be reduced if you live off-campus?  How do you tell whether you are ""designated"" as on-campus or off-campus?  What if I decided to commute from my parents' house in Folsom, would that make my financial aid even less?  Is there any sort of link on the UCD website that explains this information?

I currently get a bit less than 6k in Pell Grant, ~600 in University Campus Fee Grant, and ~14k in Cal Grant. EFC is 0. Self help + loans is 3500 + 5000. And I qualify for the Blue & Gold thing.

Sexual Assault,0,4,"I want to phrase this carefully so as not to jeopardize my friend's trust or the case that has been brought against her. I just feel frustrated and I want someone to offer insight from the outside. I don't know all the details so that works against me here. My friend was blackout drunk (she had a drinking problem at the time, partially based on the sexual assault she herself suffered a few years prior), at like a house party of a group of UCD students who are part of an organization associated with UCD. The group she was with was also drunk, and some of them possibly blackout drunk. My friend (hereafter ""Friend"") and another girl (let's call her ""2nd girl"") end up in a room together, I know not how. A 3rd girl walks into the room and sees my friend on top of 2nd girl, trying to make out with her or possibly actually making out with her while 2nd girl appeared unconscious. 3rd girl, hereafter ""Accuser,"" accuses my friend of sexual assault to the organization associated with UCD, and ultimately to the appropriate UCD office. Some details: my friend and 2nd girl are comparable in size, 2nd girl being somewhat fitter and taller; my friend has some serious self-esteem problems, history of self-harm, food issues, and hx of severe depression; 2nd girl seems not to have wanted to pursue the case right after it was initiated, but Accuser has a very strong personality and is now spearheading the effort, and getting other members of the group to also contribute to the case (such things as Friend grabbed the crotch of one male of the group while sitting on his lap, Friend inappropriately touched the butt of 2nd Accuser during party, amongst other filings); 2nd girl mysteriously befriended my Friend on Facebook maybe a week after the incident.

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, I just wish my friend didn't exist in such a vacuum of self-hatred and despair. I wish there was a group on campus not associated with the school that could help her with this. I wish someone non-judicial could intervene. She's like 22, highly intelligent, and she told me she's very suicidal. Don't tell me she should seek professional help or school counseling, I will disregard you, as she would disregard me. She insists on dealing with this herself because she is incredibly stubborn and incredibly hard on herself. Also, she has to spend all her savings on a lawyer for this case. Her family is a little emotionally abusive and has no sympathy for her. She works and lives off-campus. She's afraid she won't graduate and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over her head (my phrasing) so it's difficult for her to do school work, and she normally would be getting straight As (she's STEM). It's just so fucked she feels all persecuted and alone, and I know Accuser is moving forward with the accusations and I think 2nd girl and maybe one other person are going to corroborate, but damn this girl doesn't deserve this.",dstmp7,ucdavis

We would also like to organize munchs, and maybe even a mixer or something. We are in no way equipped to organize or vet for play events; that just isn’t in the cards right now.

So far I have two people on board with another two people giving me something of a firm “let's wait and see”. I’m writing this post to gauge interest and see if we even have a chance. I’m assuming only 1 out 10 or 15 people who say they would be into something like this will actually show up. So if you do think there is a chance you would like to explore please comment or send a private message. 

We have a few roadblocks that we are working on, any ideas or feedback would be appreciated.

* **The administration is totally not cool with this**. Anything we set up will need to be off campus and not affiliated with the university. There used to be clubs and seminars on campus but the administration has pretty well cleaned house, hence our push to try and offer some level of resources to the student population.
* To regrow a dead kink/BDSM scene we are going to need to advertise outside of FetLife and similar kink groups. We anticipate a serious issue of “thirsty weirdos and Kink Shamers” *(at least these are the terms we have used so far)* so vetting is going to be a top priority. We might even go so far as to vet before munches, *(such as getting coffee a few times before allowing someone into what would otherwise be an entry level event)*. We don’t have any set rules yet, but we are working on it.
* The group so far has a very low experience level with Kink/BDSM skills. We are currently looking for people in the Davis area that may be willing to host classes or workshops. We’re fairly confident in ourselves, and a few of our members have professional skill sets around organizing events, distributing information online, or working with social media. We can for sure do the set up and legwork, the actual kinky business on the other hand….well, lets just say positions are still open.
* Given the sensitive nature, anonymity and discretion is a must. We are likely going to create some sort of online vetting process or online play space. We are still working on the details. Ideally this will be a whitelisted system, and will only be open midway though the vetting process.

So this is what I have so far, it looks like I’m getting a little more use out of this throw away account anyway. So, please share your input with our team. **Again just to make this extremely clear**, we are not making a sex club, we are not looking for easy hookups, and we are not looking for any drama or trouble. The goal is to simply rebuild the kink community in Davis so that kinky students has a safe place to learn, explore, and grow in their sexuality. The point of a BDSM/Kink community is to weed the predators out and create a safe space for exploration. 

Edit: I have received quite a bit of feed back, I will be contacting some of you via private message in the next few days. I will make a new post once every thing is more concrete. We want to thank all of you for your time, effort, and support.",a1xsaw,ucdavis
Housing for grad students,4,5,Coming to UC Davis this August but I am from the east coast so coming over to casually find off campus housing is not a really viable option. Anyone with a similar situation or someone who can provide some insight? Thanks.,azhtge,ucdavis
vent: not exactly feeling wanted/first choice. anyone else feel the same?,5,6,"so i am a freshman at uc davis, i live in the dorms. i have been here a quarter and have met a lot of cool people. some of them seem to like me and are really nice and fun to be with, but they don't have much time for me and usually have their own sets of friends. this kinda makes me feel like a second choice, someone who is a friend and who others like, but not someone they would hang out with all the time. they don't really think of me, but seem happy when they see me in real life.

it became really clear lately. lots of people have found their roommates for living off campus next year, but no one is that close to me to ask me, and i usually get turned down when i ask because people are ""planning to ask someone else"". i usually eat alone at the dc, so i notice certain things, like the same groups of people eating together all the time. even when i eat with someone, it's because i ran into them there and asked them if i could join. lots of people i know plan when they eat, study, hang out, so on. i can't even get someone to invite me for a flippin' lunch.

i know that i am not alone. but if i try to reach out and find someone else, there's a high chance i become their second choice as well. people i have spoken to in classes usually don't like me, cause i do talk a bit too much and am a bit annoying when they try to focus. i play a sport and my friends there like me, but not as someone who they would hang out with for more than 2-3 hours a week (the fact they live far from my dorm doesn't help). i am not part of any clubs, because the ones i would be interested in have meetings that coincide with my class schedule, or just don't exist. in my free time i play minecraft and watch youtube videos and riverdale. i listen to alt rock and edm music, and certainly not mo bamba or sicko mode.

if you can understand what i am going through, feel free to drop a comment or message. yes, there is that chance we will still be each other's second choices, but at least we will understand what the other is going through :)

finally, this is a legitimate vent, so please don't try to be witty or sardonic in the comments

p.s. no, i am not interested in the aggie gaming club or your religious group

p.p.s. i did my schooling abroad so if you don't like people with accents or aren't used to hanging out with people from abroad, don't even bother",ano1hm,ucdavis

Does anyone in Davis know/have a safe indoor space I can rent out next school year for my two rabbits?

I am a first year going to live off campus next year and I missed being able to see my bunnies :/

I would provide food, a litter box, an X pen and all the supplies. They would just need a place to stay and someone to change their box every few days and maybe hang out with them sometimes.

They are shy but very sweet and loving. If you have a space (near North Davis preferred), PM me and we can discuss rent for them. Thank you :)

Housing Day (Today) - Get your housing questions answered in person.,30,1,"https://asucd.ucdavis.edu/portfolio-item/housing-day/

Everyone's talking about finding second-year housing, so here's what looks to be a good event to attend.

*Housing Day is an annual ASUCD event held in early winter quarter to help students find off-campus housing for the following year. Housing Day is particularly helpful for freshman and transfer students because of its convenient location, vast resources and knowledgeable staff members. Representatives from many Davis apartment complexes are there to pass out brochures about their location, prices and floor plans as well as answer any questions students may have. It is a popular event also well known for the abundant promotional giveaways and free food provided by many complexes.*",ajduq5,ucdavis

Housing Dilemma,4,2,So currently I’m a second year living off campus apartments. I have a couple friends from CC who are”probably” coming to Davis next year. I’m living with a couple of people that I’m have an ok relationship with but I rather live with some of my friends that are “probably “ coming over. The dilemma here is that since they’re probably coming over I’m not sure how I should handle it with my current roommates. I’m fine with living with them like beyond this year as well but I’m not sure how I should approach this situation with people who are likely coming with my current roommate situation. It’s because college decision don’t come out until March and I’m expected to either renew the lease by February I think or find another place.,addtm5,ucdavis
Fellow students want to help me out?,8,7,"I’m an Animal Science junior, minoring in wfcb. I work off campus almost every weekday 4-8, but my mental health has been taking a serious hit this quarter. I’ve found myself in a serious depression episode these last couple of weeks, and I wouldn’t dream of hurting myself or anything, but I’m just burnt out and mentally exhausted. Work has been interfering with my grades because I don’t have the time to study anymore or catch up on assignments, and I’m currently on a 17 unit workload. My diet has gone to shit because I bike 8 miles a day (i have no choice), plus walk 4 because of work (I’m a food server), so I’m burning a lot more calories than I take in (burn 2100, take in <800). Someone please offer up some kind of advice on this because I just feel like a failure at this point; the graduate school option isn’t looking too possible for the future anymore because I fucked up freshman year, and I just cant bounce back.

Where's the dating scene?,9,20,"At the risk of sounding like a whiny incel, I'm a guy who hasn't had the greatest experience with dating at UCD. I just finished my first year as a transfer, so I kinda missed out on making connections as a freshman/junior. Now I'm going to be a senior and no one wants to date a guy who's going to graduate and leave the area in under a year -\_-

It doesn't really help knowing that the school is more female-populated and that there are threads up of single girls also complaining about a dry scene and yet I'm the one who can't find a date. So I guess my question is what's your advice for an off-campus senior looking for love? Thanks.",8zn7ml,ucdavis

Best off campus apartments/townhouses?,0,6,"I’m looking for a new place to live next year. I’m currently at Valentine Commons and it’s just okay. I feel like the actual apartment is not worth the price but the distance is why I live there.

It can be an apartment like that or a townhouse that I need to furnish and pay for utilities separately. I would prefer to not have to drive to school, so a shuttle or a place near a bus stop would be ideal.

So basically I’m asking if anyone has any recommendations on where to live. It’s okay if I have to live further away from campus and drive to class, I’ve just heard that parking is expensive and hard to get.

1.How much are we gonna charged per day during the time we live in Syme22? Or we simply don’t need to pay during hurricane.
2.If it does charge us, is it going to charged from Sep, 12th or the day the actually moving in?

Impromptu Summer Off-campus Housing Help,3,8,"So I just found out the other day that I got a research assistant position (paid) with a professor and her colleagues for the summer!

I have a fallback in that a friend who will be away at herpatology camp for the summer will let me use his room at his apartment, but he'll be back some weekends and I'd need to take the couch.

I would really rather have my own place, so are there any apartment compelxes/companies that do summer leases for summer students? Ideally I'd like to be able to just get a summer lease (if that's a thing) with one of the student apartment places since they can lease by bed and tbh its simpler for me.

"What happens when cops bust parties, both on and off campus?",9,9,"I'm a transfer from a school that totally cared about underage drinking. Fortunately I never did get caught, but I was at one house party where the cops showed up, waited it out, and the only reason I got away was because I ran where they had a gap and didn't notice. But it really shook me up and I've been terrified of drinking in case I get caught. It's so bad when I get to parties all I can think is ""Oh man, this is going to get busted and I'm going to get ticketed."" I've been sober DD and thought that before... Plus, I'm in NROTC and if I get caught I get kicked out. So what's it like when the cops show up?",1l04jb,ncsu

What have been your likes and dislikes as a transfer student?,17,11,"I’m a transfer student. I’m a little older than some of my classmates because I took a lot of time off or did part time school for a long time. In some ways, I’m glad I did; I’m definitely more responsible now than I would’ve been had I come here straight out of high school (that’s just me personally). I also took my time deciding what I wanted to major in, and I’m glad I didn’t do that at a 4-year school. It’s been weird. Lots of positives and lots of negatives.  
  
What have you liked and disliked as a transfer student?

Likes: my current professors, getting to take classes finally relevant to my major with work I enjoy, and proximity to DTR.  A lot of people here are nice. I like Hunt Library and DH Hill and all the restaurants on Hillsborough. I’ve got a good parking spot. I also feel like a lot of resources are available for students. It’s probably like that at most big 4-year schools, but it’s nice to see coming from a community college. On-campus bus system has been good to me so far. I like walking around campus when it’s not raining and 40 outside. 
  
Dislikes: everyone is younger and making friends is kinda weird. I don’t live near campus either, so that’s a struggle. It’s hard coming into a new environment like this and trying to get the hang of things when you aren’t a freshman. I was in a mode of kind of avoiding everyone at my community college and it’s been hard to get out of that mindset. I feel this is compounded by living off campus.

I wish it was more socially acceptable to work around campus with your shirt off,0,5,"Whenever it’s a hot day or I just worked out and haven’t cooled off yet all I want is to go to the library find a cubicle and take my shirt off so I can cool off while I’m working. I tried this once in a corner cubicle at hill and it was bliss until some normie walked by and looked at me like a I was the weirdo for just wanting some fucking freedom from my confining shirt for once. Like jeez if you’re a guy and have a good body people would think you’re an douchebag just showing off trying to pick up chix but if you’re out of shape and have your shirt off you’re a grotesue subhuman exposing his monstrosity of an upper body to innocent passerbys. And before you smug, faux-avant-garde liberals lean off your high horses just enough to tell me to just ignore what people think and do what I feel like, why don’t you first ask me how comfortable I am going top-rogue in this judgemental environment. Not everybody has the psychological fortitude to run around like a fairy under a rainbow ignoring social norms while people stare. 

All I’m trying to say here is that there’s no reason guys should feel stigmatized for trying to stay cool while they’re working on schoolwork and they’re too hot and want to focus. So if you agree with me and you aren’t afraid to do it yourself go ahead! And hey, if any hot girls also want to work topless I’m the last one you’ll see complaining (;",ax10c9,ncsu

Graduate Housing - Area recommendations?,3,5,"I'm an international student starting next Fall. I'd move to North Carolina with my wife, who would not be able to work (F2 Visa), so we're trying to spend our stipend wisely. No car. The school department is in the North Campus.

I first considered NCSU graduate housing, namely ES King Village Apartments, but I found [many discouraging reviews](https://www.apartmentratings.com/nc/raleigh/es-king-village_919515243027607/). The place seems to be a) quite unsafe, b) ugly, and c) full of pests.

We're now considering off-campus alternatives, which should ideally comply with the following requisites:

* Safe area: my wife will spend some time alone at home, buy groceries alone, etc.
* Close to the wolf line: we won't have a car and the wolf line is free of charge.
* Quiet: we want to avoid happy undergrads partying overnight.
* Size: Two bedroom (i.e. one room to sleep, and a separate room for the kitchen/living room) somewhere in the 700sqft range. Not huge, but comfortable enough for a couple in their 30's :). Sharing is not an option.
* Fair price: Two bedroom apartment at E.S. King Village costs USD 815 a month (furnished, includes all but internet, gas, electricity), and Western Manor is USD 950 (unfurnished, includes all but electricity), so ideally we'd spend something on that range.

I know virtually nothing about Raleigh, so hunting apartments online feels like taking a stab in the dark. Would you please suggest some areas that are safe and close to the wolf line? Where I should look for rentals?",7x1acv,ncsu
META: How should this sub handle politically charged events?,61,24,"To preface, this post is only about how we handle these events, not the events themselves. Please remain on topic. 

So obviously, we've had two large events that occurred on campus in the past weeks. With these two events came a lot of throw away accounts, a few bans, a bunch of comments/posts being removed etc. And daily traffic which was 2x-5x what we're used to.

The current policy was to create a megathread, pin it to the top, and direct all conversation there. If there had been active posts prior to the megathread (which was the case for the Freedom of Expression Tunnel event but not TPUSA), those were allowed to stay. We also did reactive an automod rule to restrict new accounts from creating new posts (but still allowed to comment).

We generally tried to be hands off, but all the mods did try to address comments that were reported. We are busy with our own personal lives, so heavily reported items in the modqueue make it easier for us to see flagrant issues and take action. So thanks to everyone who made use of that feature. 

So now that things have cooled down slightly, we're opening it up for feedback. How did we do? What would you have liked to seen that we didn't? 

I do want to stress, that our goal is to make /r/ncsu enjoyable for everyone who uses it. We are not a political sub by nature, for that, I suggest [Wolfpack Politics](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WPPolitics/) or [WPS 2.0](https://www.facebook.com/groups/447018895467030/) on facebook.",e09oh5,ncsu

Had a great start at Summer Start!,21,5,"In case any future Wolfpack decides to look up Summer Start, I'll just go ahead and make this post. I am a freshman who did the Summer Start program and I was blown away by how fun it ended up being. I made many amazing friends and I never felt truly bored, unlike how I feel at home right now. Starting college with a 4.0 GPA is also pretty nice. I would recommend this program to anyone who wishes to slowly integrate to college life and get an academic advantage. If you do the program, here are some tips:

- Use the gym, as it's relatively empty during the summer, and an empty gym is the best gym

- The dining halls close early at 7pm. It's good to get a take out tray if you eat late or learn the cheap off campus restaurants (Gumby's, Shanghai Express, and of course, CookOut)

- Befriend your mentors, even if they are there for a job, they are humans too, and are pretty cool 

- If you are ever bored, instead of just chilling in your room, chill out in the lounges or study rooms, you'll meet and befriend more people that way


P.S: I was on the ground floor (Room 67) in case anyone else who just did Summer Start wants to know who I am :)",6razmj,ncsu

I want to try to avoid spending a bunch of money on a ""nice apartment"" if the apartment isn't actually going to turn out to be that nice. (Have heard a few things about ""luxury apartments"" being cramped, loud, and poorly managed.)

Is it better to look a farther off campus/beyond the big corporate apartments? I am hoping to live with three other people, and would love to spend five-hundred or less a month.

I would appreciate hearing any of your advice and experiences. Thanks! ",3th1r2,uofmn

Incoming Graduate Student here. Looking for roommate/s to live off campus with.,6,1,"Hello Reddit, I’m a graduate student (male) coming to UMN this Fall. I’m looking for two, three or even four more students who are interested in living off campus for the next academic year.

About myself; I’m patient, tolerant, pragmatic and cheerful. I would like to consider myself as tidy, but I’m definitely not a clean freak. I’m into Movies, Novels and Anime. I do spend a lot of time on video games, mostly RPG and Strategy games. Although I’m not much of a party person myself, I have no issues with drinking/smoking, as long as there is no smoking inside the house. 

I would like to mention that I have not found housing yet. I’m hoping that I could find three or four roommates and we all could find a place near campus that best suits all our needs. I would prefer living with three or four people over the traditional two person house. 

So if you’re interested, PM me and we can discuss more.

Looking for Apartment Roommates for Next Schoolyear,22,11,"Hi,

I am a current freshman looking to rent an off-campus apartment with 1-2 other people for next year. I already have a couple properties picked out that I have toured, have reasonable rent, and are within a 10 minute walk to campus (PM me for more info).

I was looking for roommates, but the UMN Roommate Finder doesn't seem to be of much help, the Facebook groups are just people looking to sublease, and all of my friends want to be CAs next year -- so here I am. 

I am an 18-year-old male, CLA student, quite studious, I won't party in the apartment, LGBT-Friendly, flexible schedule, know how to cook, and I am open to living with people of any gender, sexuality, race, religion, or income level.

"Incoming Freshman seeking dwelling advice; I want to bypass the ""college experience.""",0,22,"Hello.

I am nearing the cessation of my high school degree, at which point I will vacate my childhood bedroom supplied by my loving parents in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and acquire undergraduate status at the University of Minnesota where I will specialize in music and piano pedagogy. 

To be blunt, I highly despise human inhabitance of my personal space. I prefer solitude, quiet, order, privacy, and time for reflection and possess zero desire to immerse myself amongst the hoards of young, incendiary weasels who fuel their souls with alcohol and raucous behavior. I will also not tolerate a roommate, and in the event that I am paired with one, my father is prepared to spring into legal action and milk the university or rental agency for every penny they're worth. My mother is currently conspiring with the university to exempt me from attending Freshman Orientation, as I possess no interest in their laughable social introductions, no interest in learning to navigate the campus, and will register for courses individually with my instructor. I would also decline the requirement to spend a night in the residence halls with a roommate, and again, should I be forced to attend orientation, legal action will be initiated should I not be provided with a private room.

I have completely shuddered the idea of living in the residence halls, due to presumably thin walls and a pervasive lack of quiet time or order. I am nauseated by the idea of eating with other students in the dining halls, and plan to invest in a personalized shopper who will deliver high quality products to my dwelling where I can prepare meals to my liking and eat them in peace and privacy. The residence halls will not offer me this luxury, and I have made it clear to my parents that they will not suffice for me. 

My intent is to acquire an off-campus dwelling that lacks any considerable association with the university or any youth-centric communities. Below, I will state the requirements for my new dwelling:

1. Ideally greater than five miles from any college campus or neighborhood predominantly inhabited by residents under the age of 25.
2. Ideally a 30-60 minute vehicular commute in peak rush hour from the West Bank of the University of Minnesota.
3. Bohemian attributes. I require walkability in the sense that I can traverse from my flat or apartment across the street into a community coffee establishment, order my beans, and sit quietly without anyone pursuing or speaking to me.
4. Absolutely no bars anywhere in the immediate vicinity of my dwelling; approx. 7-10 blocks in every direction
5. I require updated and proficient appliances and facilities. I require stainless steel appliances and prefer a gourmet oven set-up as well as a veranda or large picture window. These requirements are blatantly non-negotiable, and I will be viewing all dwellings in person before making a final selection to avoid having to file a small claims suit against a rental agency for false promotion of such luxuries. My parents would be prepared to take legal action should I not be pleased with the conditions or should my dwelling not match the empirical description provided by the owner. A reputable and high-quality leasing agency is a must here.


My parents are willing to spend a maximum of $2,600/mo. on my dwelling, with room for negotiation. I am confident that they would allocate up to $3,500 monthly in the case that I find a sufficient dwelling. I am seeking a dwelling that not only matches the qualifications listed above as precisely as possible but will also exclude and excuse me from any and all contact with youth, my peers, and the ""classic college experience"" as I do not value the laughable social relationships formed in college nor do I care to broaden my worldview with overly-liberated wish wash that the university already plans to shove down my throat -for me to later regurgitate. 

Please provide me with guidance and recommendations on a compatible dwelling.

How to go about exchange housing for one semester only?,2,3,"Hi all, 
I am an incoming exchange student for the fall (2019) semester. Due to the fact that I'll be studying at graduate school, I am not eligible for any on-campus housing. Finding options off-campus is not a problem, however, finding them for one semester only is. 
Therefore I wondered how realistic it is for me to sign a yearly lease and sublet between January and August. 

Because I know someone with the same problem, I could rent a shared room or a private room with two people that would both leave, depending on what would be easier to sublet. 

Please do tell me if there are way better options than the one I'm currently considering. As far as I can tell, this is a decent manner to live in a building with other students for not much more than 600 dollars a month, but I might be wrong.

Quality content guys.

Some Background on me:

I'm now a senior here at the University of Minnesota, graduating this semester with a BA in CSCI. (CSCI 3081W being the boring ass class I wrote the first guide in.) I was born and raised in a Chinese household that lived on campus, my parents doing grad school here and at St. Thomas, while also doing labor jobs to pay for the family. Later leaving Minneapolis for the suburbs, where we no longer had to worry about being shot at (Como was much different in the 90s). From then on, I was inspired by food people like Andrew Zimmern, Anthoney Bourdain, and Eddie Huang to start writing about my experiences with the food around me.

Things have changed since my last post, Bun Mi, VWok, and Quangminh have all closed down. They have been included in the  **RIP:** **Rest In Pepperonis** section of this page.
My opinions have also changed of some places, as some have also changed menus, or done some internal shit. I've also expanded the guide to include some places nearby UMN, reachable by Light Rail or Bus.

So I'm back, and I'm pissed. This year's guide is no hold barred, no more Mr. Nice Guy, i'm going to steal yo girl, have her call you midway through, then feed you the leftovers with a dirty spoon I used back at the restaurant.

I present to you: (*drumroll*)

Peking Garden | Chinese (Eastern)| $$ | Midway | Didn't include this one in my previous guide, as it required you to go to the area that also features one of the most homicidal and violent McDonalds in the area. Now, I don't give a fuck. This place used to be on campus, but left around the same time that the I-35W bridge collapsed. When I was little kid, and my parents went here for Grad School, the spot we would go for special occasions would be this spot. Whenever I imagine certain dishes, I still compare them to the tastes of the chef at this spot. It's great, the dinner specials where they do flat rate Dinner for 4/6/8/10/House is top notch, and probably best you can get at the price. Each pricing at $60/4, $105/6 , $138/8 , $180/10 , $245/House | Still one of my favorite spots, and closest to my heart. But if you do go there, go with a lot of people, or don't go too late at night. If you get robbed or shot in Midway, then join the rest of us at the table in heaven, where the chef works here every other day. | [Dine-In Menu](http://www.pekinggardenmn.com/ourmenu.html); [Take Out Menu](http://www.pekinggardenmn.com/takeOutAppetizers.html)
Shuang Cheng | Chinese (South Eastern)| $$ | Dinkytown | The Chinese restaurant served by Lao people, that every other white person can't pronounce for the life of them, (Prounounce it Shwong Chung, if you call it Schwang Chang one more time, I'm going to bring my .45 and teach you fucking Chinese, motherfucker). The owner is the only person that is even remotely Chinese, being Chinese-Viet. So don't practice that shitty Chinese here, you just will make a fool of yourself like every other *guailo*. Food's pretty good though, and the place is rather intimate, and even gives you that feel as though you are eating in an alley restaurant.  | Go to spot in Dinkytown with some friends, or with some family. Quality spot that has been on campus for years. | [Menu (PDF)](http://www.shuangchengrestaurant.com/menu.pdf)
Pagoda | Chinese (Southern / Eastern) | $$ | Dinkytown | Ah Pagoda, the spot where I have taken my parents to, as well as drunk inane amounts while with friends. This place has been one that has been the start of many good memories, as well as some bad ones. Place is pretty good, lunch specials are filling and not too pricy, but holy hell, when it comes to the Asian New Years, this place gets rowdy as fuck. Also during happy hour, it's BOGO large beers and Double Order Appetizers for a dollar more (especially the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings)  | Come with friends for the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings, stay for the drunken memories and the good times.| [Menu](http://www.pagodaminneapolis.com/menu.aspx)
Little Szechuan | Chinese (Sichuan) | $$$ / $$ | Stadium Village | Good Sichuan Style Chinese food is tough to come by, this spot is top tier, as the dishes are well known by the community. The spot still tastes great after a change in management. But the best part? The place is not only good at date night, but it can also be a good filling Lunch Special priced at around $8.30. Super filling and rivals that of the legendary lunch special of Kowloon. | Have that hot date? Want a super filling Lunch Special? You owe me one, fam. | [Menu (PDF)](http://littleszechuan.com/menus/LittleSzechuanUM_Menu.pdf)
Teahouse | Chinese (Sichuan) | $$$ | Stadium Village | The other Sichuan spot in Stadium Village, you know, the one that the guy drove his car through? I made the drive through joke last time. The decor is nice, and the brunch buffet is not bad as well. But that's about it. That's all I can really say about the spot, I guess. | Brunch buffet? Want to make that one drive through joke? Well, be my guest. | [Dine-In Menu(PDF)](http://ourteahouse.com/Menus/DineIn2016A_Web.pdf); [Lunch Special Menu (PDF)](http://ourteahouse.com/Menus/LunchSpecials2016A_Web.pdf).
Unideli | Chinese (Deli) | $$ | Minnehaha Ave | The spot down Minnehaha Ave that is tucked away in a sketchy area, in a warehouse. Every time I go there, I have to remind my non Asian friends, that I'm not bringing them here to harvest their organs and sell them on eBay. The spot is located in the United Noodles Asian Grocery, and has pretty good stuff, from a good Ramen, to some other good meals and snacks. Seemingly to start getting the attendance of hipsters though. Oh, and [Guy Fieri visited here](http://www.unitednoodles.com/blog/2015/11/18/unideli-on-the-food-network-diners-drive-ins-and-dives), I mean he's famous and all, but fuck his frost tips. He's got to be the food personality with the shittiest hair. | Asian Grocery run? Eat at UniDeli before you head out. | [Menu](http://www.unitednoodles.com/unideli/)
China Express | Chinese (American) | $ | Dinkytown | The cheap Chinese joint that doesn't disappoint. Still great and cheap after all these years. Won't be the best tasting Chinese food in town, but will be some of the best budget shit in Dinkytown. | When you lit or turnt and need that Chinese food fill. | [Menu](http://chinaexpressmn.com/)
Lucky Dragon | Chinese (Viet) | $$ | West Bank | The Chinese food game on West Bank is really on dictated by Keefer Court and this spot. Standard Chinese fare with some Viet influences. They're cheap and have a big wedding room upstairs that you can use for events and shit.  | Chinese dinner on west bank, and right after you have the wedding and the honeymoon in the same spot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) | [Menu](http://chinaexpressmn.com/)
Ugarden | Chinese (American) | $ | Prospect Park | It's far out, but when it's late and you're in Prospect Park of all places, you may as well go to Ugarden. One of the only Chinese buffets in the area. Best to go when lit / drunk and *really* craving that Chinese fare.| You just finished day drinking with some friends and really want to binge on the Chinese food. The sesame chicken in bulk. | Buffet, you don't need the menu
Panda Express | Chinese (American) | $$$ | Coffman | The chain restaurant I left out last time I wrote this guide. I didn't even give this spot the light of day in the past guide. You know why? Because it's expensive, it tastes cheap, and it represents everything I hate about Americanized Chinese food. I still go for lunch when I have no time to go anywhere else, but its line is not even close to worth it half the time. | The hot garbage place that you only go to if the line is short and you have 20 mins to pick up food on campus. Which usually is never. | [Chain Menu *grumble*](https://www.pandaexpress.com/menu)
Keefer Court | Chinese Pastry | $ | West Bank | The Chinese pastry spot that's still my go-to every time I feel like experiencing my past. The buns here are filling and cheap, and if you happen to be on west bank, then it's only win-win. Just don't be the *guailo* and go on Tuesdays, they're closed on Tuesdays for some reason.| Cheap meal with buns that are hella filling. | [Menu](http://www.keefercourt.com/menu.html) 
Bona | Vietnamese | $$ | Stadium Village | The only Pho place in Stadium Village, the place is okay, the pho isn't the best in town, but it is the closest. Still worth if you are hungover as shit and need that pho. | Hangover Pho. Also Viet Drip Coffee. | Couldn't find an online menu.
Camdi | Vietnamese-Chinese | $$ | Dinkytown | A pretty chill spot in Dinkytown, the owners are nice and the food isn't the worst. It is also the only pho place in Dinkytown, it's as if Bona and Camdi came to an agreement to split the pho market on campus. | Hangover pho in Dinkytown. | [Menu (PDF)](http://www.camdirestaurant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/camdimenu_final.pdf)
Tofu House | Korean | $$ | Stadium Village | No other spot specializes in the Sundubu like this spot. A good spot for tofu soups. The korean side dishes are also top tier. | On a rainy day, nothing beats this spot and how intimate it is. Bring bae here after a day of reading and tea. | No menu online.
Korea | Korean | $$ | Stadium Village | The main Korean place I go to for take out, still my favorite Korean spot, has a hair salon and a Karoake bar up stairs. Best to do either while completely wasted and belting out Kenny Loggins. | The bulgogi, Hair, and Drunk Karoake continues. | Couldn't find the menu, wtf is up with Korean spots and not having online menus?
Green Spoon | Korean ~~-American Fusion~~ | $$ | Stadium Village | Green Spoon has changed in some ways, since the last time I wrote. They took out the American Fusion, and are now strictly Korean and assorted dishes. It's still in good quality, as well as having a brunch buffet that is also pretty good. | Brunch Buffet and to take the Korean wannabe who listens to too much KPOP. | [Menu (on facebook? wtf)](https://www.facebook.com/greenspooncafe/menu?ref=page_internal)
Obento-ya | Japanese | $$$  | Como | The high end Japanese Bento spot, located slightly off campus, in Como. Good spot for Bento, and they also recently jumped on the whole Poke Bowl craze. Best part though? They have the fancy Japanese toilets with the bidets and seat warmers in their bathrooms.| Bento Box Date night. Catching up with people is also great here. | [Menu (kinda built into their site)](http://www.obento-ya.com/)
One Two Three Sushi | Japanese | $$$ | Dinkytown | The costly basic chain spot that I was too nice to last time. It's too overpriced and too mediocre to be worth going. Dinkytown's only sushi spot sucks. Want Japanese food? Take the extra stop on the 3 Bus to Como and go to Obento-Ya. | Want to make your own sushi roll? It won't be cheap, it'll cost around a chipotle burrito, but not be as filling. You can do it here. Go to the Qdoba down the block if you want the bang for you buck. | [Menu](http://onetwothreesushi.com/nutrition-menu/menu/custom-sushi/)
Mango Factory | Japanese | $$$ | West Bank | Imagine the perfect one, the gorgeous girl that isn't a piece of shit to you or your friends. The guy who is both smart, well built, and not in over his head. The one you really want to go far with. You have them in mind? Take them here. Get the Groupon, which makes the entire meal not only good, but for a good price. That way you can make love with an unhurt wallet. ;) Also the desserts and drinks are pretty good. | Take the one you love / want to love here. They will not only love it, but will also probably love you. High hopes though. | [Menu](http://www.mangofactory-mn.com/menu1)
Haiku | Japanese | $$$ | Stadium Village | The overpriced spot that basic people take others on dates. The prices are awful for a sushi spot, and the only thing even okay is the happy hour. But even then, the happy hour would be normally priced compared to other spots. Also avoid the Udon soups here, they taste cheap, are expensive, and just straight up suck.| Go here for Happy Hour if there is nothing else that you want to go to. Otherwise, don't bother. | No menu I could find posted, fuck it.
Ippindo Ramen House | Japanese | $$ | Stadium Village | The new Japanese spot in Stadium Village. The place is alright, but the one thing I love about the spot, is how Haiku, the overpriced and shitty spot it is,  is now suffering and losing out to the people actually getting better than bad food. Get shit on Haiku. Stadium Village can finally stop feeding at your overpriced rolls and noodle bowls you made on the cent. | Go to the Japanese spot in Stadium Village that doesn't suck. | [Menu (PDF)](http://calvinyeung.github.io/ippindoRamen/img/ippindoImg/ippindoMenu.pdf)

#RIP: Rest In Pepperonis
This section is dedicated to all the restaurants that have closed since I last posted. 

While many students bemoan the loss of these restaurants, the local landlords responded in kind with ""LOL PROPERTY PRICES, SUCKS TO SUCK."" 

One not included, but was also a quality spot was Afro Deli. RIP good Somali food. Now I have to go to Riverside and get mugged in order to get the good stuff.



Name | Type |Price | Location |  In Memoriam |
---|---|----|----|---- | -----
Village Wok | Chinese (General) | $ | Stadium Village | A spot that I have controversially called ""the trashiest Chinese Restaurant on Campus"" and gotten a lot of shit for. Back in the day, my parents used to frequent this spot. It was owned by nice people, and served authentic Chinese seafood, that would remind my parents of the homeland they left, to pursue an education here. In recent years, the spot decided to cheap out, and serve cheap ingredients put at high prices. But even then, it closing was bittersweet. The once great spot is atone to a dog that still reminisces on its younger years, full of energy and willing to play with the ball no matter the cost, but now you have to put it down Old Yeller style, because it can no longer pay rent for the new place you're building.
Quang Minh | Vietnamese/Malay-Chinese | $$ | Dinkytown | The prime Malay spot right under the tallest building in Dinkytown. Long gone are the days of drunk takeout, the days shooting shit before it closed. Man this spot was great. RIP Quang Minh.
Bun Mi | Vietnamese (Sandwiches) | $ | Stadium Village | The spot, where in its heyday, would be the top spot in budget eating with its BOGO (Buy One Get One) meals. Each time totaling to around $3.50 everytime you went with a friend. And man were those fries and Sriracha Mayo filling. RIP to the lunch spot we all loved.|

As places close, and as I prepare to graduate from the Unviersity, I can finally leave knowing that you bastards left with something good in your stomachs.

Go on that pilgrimage to try these spots out. They won't be here forever.

Your friend, 

Zenbhang

Potential exchange student housing queries,2,4,"Hello there, I'm a potential fall semester exchange student from Australia and was just wondering out of the 2 housing options (for exchange students), University village or off-campus housing which one would you people recommend?

I went to a residential-only liberal arts college in a different state, so finding a place to live is a little overwhelming for me. I'm unmarried, no pets, and ideally want to live in a 1 bed 1 bath on the East Bank.

My parents will be helping me out on rent because it's a school expense, so I could afford to live close, possibly in a nicer place like The Marshall or The Knoll (neither of which I saw on the off-campus housing guide, which is why I'm posting). While the amenities seem awesome at these kinds of places, I'm afraid that they'll be full of undergrads who want to party at 8 AM on game day. I'm not a hermit by any means, but my idea of a good time is a little more low-key, i.e. sitting around and drinking and talking.

The players on offence must get the flag while avoiding being tagged by the defense and return the flag to the midline. We meet weekly on Fridays at 9:00 PM outside Northrop, 

Due to a bit of confusion the last time this was posted, I wanted to clarify that we meet near the stage set up outside Northrop (Or where it was when it gets taken down).

If you need a study break tomorrow or want to burn off some steam, Please drop by!",djf1qn,uofmn

Crime Alert: 2 robbed at 8th St & 14th Ave,0,5,"From the [crime alert](http://ecommunication.umn.edu/read/archive?id=132029&e=schow043%40umn%2eedu&x=3a0cfd4e):

Minneapolis Police are investigating the report of an off-campus robbery that occurred at approximately 2:05 a.m. near the intersection of 8th Street SE and 14th Avenue SE.

Two victims, one of whom is a University of Minnesota student, reported they were walking northbound on 14th Avenue when a lone suspect came out of the bushes near a house and demanded their valuables. The suspect implied he had a gun, but did not show a weapon. The suspect took both victims' purses and a cell phone, and then fled westbound on 8th Street SE. Police responded and searched the area but were unable to locate the suspect. Neither victim was injured in the robbery.

The victims describe the suspect as a black male with a dark complexion, 20 to 23 years old, five feet nine inches to six feet tall, with a medium build. The suspect had shoulder length hair in cornrows or dreadlocks, and was wearing dark jeans, a grey zip-up sweatshirt, and black gloves.

Minneapolis Police are investigating this off-campus crime. Anyone with information is asked to call the Minneapolis Police Tip Line at 612-692-8477 and reference case number MP-15-172984.",35zm0g,uofmn

PCV vs Off-Campus Housing Costs,4,8,"I’m a 2nd year student looking into housing options for next year, both on-campus and off-campus. PCV’s prices have gone up significantly ($9747 for a single room next year), but off-campus housing usually entails additional costs for utilities/internet and often requires a full year lease, even if you are not staying in SLO over the summer. That being said, will PCV still end up being a lot more expensive overall compared to off-campus housing options? Should I still try to find off-campus housing, even if I haven’t done much research on it so far, this late in the housing process?

* CPX (Cal Poly Experience)
   * CPX was the campus climate survey sent out by the university last spring
   * Results of the CPX campus survey will be unveiled Oct. 17th and 18th to the public. The unveiling events will go over what the campus learned from the data.
* ASI
   * Executive Staff
      * If you're interested in getting involved with student government, considering joining ASI Executive Staff.
      * Executive Staff works with ASI President Mark Borges and his cabinet to accomplish policy objectives and run offical events.
      * Drop by the ASI Student Government office in University Union for more info, or visit our booth at Club Showcase
* Housing
   * **It's official!** Per Campus Administrative Policy (CAP), all students will need to live on campus *both* their 1st and 2nd years!
   * **But don't panic!** Housing needs to build more facilities before this is possible, so implementation is still a few years out.
   * University Housing is also looking at building more facilities via a process called Public-Private Partnership (P3).
      * The last several buildings housing has built have been paid for using CSU System Loans and rent cost increases.
      * P3 would allow off-campus developers to front the construction cost, gaining back the monies spent over time through collected rent payments - this should save students money upfront and over time!
      * The buildings would still be managed by University Housing - including residential life and bill payments. Students who live in the buildings likely won't notice the partnership.
      * **No Plans have been made / finalized as of yet**.
* Health & Wellbeing
   * DRC
      * Due to changes in state legislation, DRC is no longer offering a stipend for note takers. However, no student requesting notes will be turned away due to this change.
   * Health and Wellbeing is making a concerted effort to improve the situation of students struggling with substance abuse
      * This is a developing issue; stay tuned for more info

Chased out of Avila by some confederate flag trucks,41,30,"Was enjoying a day at the beach with my friend in Avila. We were getting kinda bored so we decided to drive up to the area near the diablo canyon entrance. (RV Park) What a mistake.

What I found were two guys in lifted trucks, one with a confederate flag flying from the bed. Given the absurdity of the situation, and California being nowhere near the former confederacy, I decided to take a snapchat of the whole situation, wave, and speed off. 

As I drove off, I heard the sound of a few diesel engines, and behind me were the two lifted trucks. Since my friend and I were planning on going to in n out after, we headed down Avila Beach Dr. towards 101 south. They both followed us to the freeway, flashing their lights at me as I headed there, one turning onto a side street before the freeway, but the confederate flag truck followed us onto 101. 

Given the severity of the situation, I felt I needed to take a detour or call 911. I ended up driving to the Pismo police station, and as I pulled in, the confederate flag truck drove off. In hindsight I should have called 911, but given the stress I thought that was too much. 

It's been a year since the blackface incident, and I feel nothing has really changed. Although this happened off campus, with people who presumably are not students, this kind of behavior is a serious hinderance for Cal Poly and their quest to make it a more inclusive place.",bcy7xv,CalPoly

Making an art club!,14,17,"Hello everyone! I am a second year Computer Engineering major here at Cal Poly. I am seriously interested in starting an art club here and would love if others are interested in joining and making it a legitimate club. 

After talking to a few faculty in the art department, I have learned that art classes are reserved exclusively for art majors and minors (if they can even get off the waitlist) and that there is no available studio space for any student to be able to just mess around with art. I was not very impressed with the courses offered for art minors and I only noticed one or two art clubs at the fair, mostly focused around regular painting. 

I want this club to be an inclusive environment that will be an outlet for any type of art such as painting, photography, fashion, sewing, graphic design, or anything else you can think of! I know this is not exactly the truth, but it feels as if I am being artistically suppressed here at Cal Poly and that they almost try to make it hard for people outside of art to find outlets for their work. 

If you are interested, please let me know and hopefully I can get a professor and enough students to make it a real thing! Also, if you guys know of any art studios or anything of the sort on or off campus I would love to know about it.

A warning to anyone who wants to be a WOW leader...,103,20,"Actually, a few things.

I am a former WOW leader, I really did enjoy being a leader.  But I found many of the requirements and hoops to be somewhat ridiculous and will not be returning for a few reasons.  The primary reason is the current professional leadership and their policies.  To be clear, I do support the Week of Welcome, but I do not support the current leadership.  (Also if any of you are struggling to work with the Open House Committee, these are many of the same people).

I think if you want to partake in it, that is great.  But I also hope you'll take the following into consideration.  These are my thoughts and maybe others can add to them, but if you disagree with and/or cannot commit to the following, you may want to reconsider your participation.

* **It is a lot more time than you think**: Here are all of the things you should expect to do:
  * Spring Training: Approx 30 hours over the quarter
  * Workshop: About 4 hrs, most likely on a weekend, which is basically an additional spring training with chairs
  * 1-on-1s/4-on-1s: You will have to meet with your FAC leader at some points; this will take maybe an hour over the quarter, but is 
  * Reading through weekly emails: there isn't a penalty per se, but if you do not read through them then you may get dropped because you did not do something on time.  Plus, sometimes it can take a while to find information you are looking for.
  * Find-a-co (Optional): If you want to lead a group and do not have a co, finding one can be a task.  Some people will find them really quickly, but some people may spend a good deal of time trying to find a co and still not find anyone.
  * Day in the Sun (Optional): Essentially a fake WOW-o-rama that will probably take 3-4 hours.
  * Service Day (Optional): Essentially a service day (like during WOW) that will probably take 3-4 hours.
  * Socials (Optional): You will have to organize a social during the quarter; my experience is that most of the time these socials are a flop (maybe you can get a few people)
  * Prep (Optional): If you choose to dress up (which you are supposed to do), it may take some time and money to actually get a costume.
  * Incidental time: There will be additional time you will need to respond to certain things, fill out some forms, etc.; this is probably a few hours
  * Snacks: You will have to bring snacks at least one time over the quarter.  Most people just buy things from the store, but if you make something, add that in.
  * Planning the week: You and your co will need to spend time over the summer putting your DLS together.  This can take a decent amount of time and 
  * Preweek: Essentially it is spring training condensed into a few days.  It's mostly review but takes up a good chunk of a few days.  They also will voluntell you to help students move in or do the Big Grand Welcome.  For the latter, it is kind of awkward and it is traumatizing to have to watch people get tickets.
  * The Week: Tthis is obviously what you signed up for.  Also you need to make your sign.
* **Do not expect New Student and Transition Programs (NSTP) and Orientation to respect that you are volunteering your time**: The requirements and obligations for WOW leaders have continued to grow year-after-year.  However, given the fact that we are unpaid and completely volunteer, it is amazing that they continue to expand what they want WOW leaders to do.  Yet they are also fairly resistant to trying new things which would ease the time and effort spent on training and organization.  They want you to be as committed to WOW as they are (to essentially live and breathe it), but this is unrealistic for most people.
* **Do not be cos with anyone you are not willing to lose as a friend**: I've seen (and experienced) things.  The week will make you see your co in a new light, so unless you have worked with this person before, I would be very cautious about being cos with your friends.
* **Discrepancy between policies and practice**: Many of the policies they will tell you about (which they make sound quite serious) are not always followed in practice.
  * Driving: while you are supposed to have drivers fill out paperwork, I know that many drivers do not do so.  This opens the university and drivers up to tremendous liability, but because the current pro staff are not particularly imaginative as to how they can get drivers and groups have more people than they have seats (and many of the activities are off campus), this will remain a problem.
  * Money: Technically you are only supposed to spend $25.  But anyone who has lived in SLO knows that this is an unrealistic budget which is likely set in order to make the program appear ""affordable"".  Also, do expect that being a WOW leader will cost you money.  How much is up to you.  
  * Night activities: Many groups fall apart after 8 or 9 pm.  This is in part due to a lack of night activities to do, lack of transportation, group dynamics (i.e. a lot of people bail because everyone else is), group moral (sometimes they really are tired), lack of money, and leader motivation.  So plan things, but do not necessarily expect your group will participate.  Also, there is basically nothing you can do to stop them from going out to party.
  * Expectations: Many of the expectations put upon LITs and OLs are not always followed by Team, Board, and Pro Staff.  Given that they are very strict about a lot of things, it shows poor leadership, in my opinion, when they do things like release things weeks after they say, make sudden changes and expect you to adapt, and expect understanding and empathy when they are not particularly understanding of anything.
* **""The Kool-Aid""**: There are many aspects of Spring Training which make it feel like a cult.  This is especially true of people who are on Team and Board.  While these are great people, the whole process can feel a little uncomfortable if you don't agree with everything that is being said, no matter how small the difference.  You definitely may need to navigate some doublespeak and newspeak to show that you are are a ""good WOW leader"" that embodies their missions.  A few specifics here:
  * Strength quests: I know that this is a popular program, but it is treated like gospel; I have mixed feelings about the program, but you may feel uncomfortable if you completely disagree with the idea of Strengths Quest.
  * Language: They make a big deal about precision use of certain words, terms, and phrases. Though these are not always followed in practice.
  * Traditions: Love them or hate them, they have a culty feel.
* **Many people will drop throughout Spring Training**: People drop or are dropped throughout Spring Quarter.  However, basically, if you show up (even if you never dress up) and do what you are supposed to, bring your snacks, organize your social, and don't do/say things that are against their policies, then you will be approved.  The evaluation process is not really anything but check boxes.

-----

Also, I just want to talk about Andrene for a second.  She in many ways is the face of WOW for the university and I certainly respect and admire her dedication and contributions to the program.  That said, I think she has a very particular view of how this whole process should go and that she is (or will soon be) impeding the actual improvement of the program.  She obviously believes in WOW and the mission of the university very much, but she also seems very unwilling to be flexible and to consider alternatives that are not aligned with her view of how Spring Training, SLO Days, and WOW should be.  While I will admit that I do not know her personally, these are my perceptions from my interactions with her.  As such, take this with a grain of salt.

Also for the record: she streamrolled over the objections of (many of) last year's WOW leaders when they did not believe that WOW should be mandatory (i.e. your admission will be revoked if you do not partake in SLO Days and WOW).  One point that I saw as troubling was the conflation of that students who participate (in WOW and SLO Days) are more successful which became the misleading idea (or at least was heavily implied) that WOW *causes* students to be more successful.  While I do not doubt that WOW helps some students acclimate, I think it is quite a stretch to claim that WOW is the reason Cal Poly students will be (more) successful at Cal Poly.  It could be that the students who participate in WOW are the students who are more likely to be successful generally, with or without WOW.  I think it is an important program and every one should participate if they can.  But people have their reasons for not being able to participate and we should respect their reasons.  She also presented this in a condescending way which was defensive and dismissive the concerns of students.  This, of course, is not unlike the attitude and behavior that we see from many of the campus administrators.

------

So what should they be doing to improve?  I do not want to simply point out flaws, so here are some things they should improve:

* **Alternative training program for additional E-staff**: Let's face it, most people want to actually lead groups for WOW, but it not everyone can.  But for some people who might just want to help out, it is somewhat ridiculous that they have to go through spring training, especially if they have gone through it before.  I think there are a non-trivial number of students who would be more than happy to help, but this all or nothing approach leads to the current strain on e-staff that seems to be a perpetual problem.  This would also allow some students who cannot make Spring Training (for whatever reason) to participate.  And it might get a few extra drivers.
* **Reaching out to CSC/CPE and other students to make improvements to systems**: I am amazed that NSTP does not reach out to students to help improve some of their management software.  This seems like it would be a great senior project (or two or three) and many of the necessary improvements would not be particularly difficult.  Of course, any other WOW leaders will know I am talking about which is WOWweb. They could improve with the following:
  * Add a Google Maps app that shows the expected route to be taken to/from a location
  * Using Google Maps to have pins of locations for events
  * Creating a print-friendly, visual version of your DLS (you can print it as a list, but it is more helpful to see it like Google Calendar or Outlook)
  * Create an app which you can quickly access your DLS from and/or a mobile friendly version of the web app
  * DLS Autochecking tools: these should check for white space, travel time, number of meals, required time frame, etc., instead of just using the few e-staff they have to manually check these
  * ""Event marketplace"": this would allow WOW leaders to find other people who want to trade times, who want to coordinate an event (i.e. needing more than one group for a pickup soccer or capture the flag, etc.), and find ideas of what other groups are doing to fill time
* **Better outreach, engagement, and retention of past wow leaders**: They basically only come to you when they want volunteers for Open House and Parent's Weekend.  I am also curious if there were more returners in past years (like 10/15 years ago) as opposed to today.  I'm sure the legal requirements have intensified, but definitely turn some people off from returning.  It seems that most people now do WOW (as a leader) once and then never return.  They basically treat WOW leaders as disposable and don't really care if you come back or not.  
* **Better fundraising efforts**: I think WOW does not have the coffers they once did and they are, and will be, continuing to struggle to get enough money.  For example, moving up the letter writing campaign would probably bring in more money.  The longer they wait, the fewer people who are still in Spring Training to ask for donations.  Also, increasing the number of people who are involved in some way makes it more likely that they will know people who would be willing to give money.  Furthermore, there could be ""add-ons""  
* **More types of ""WOW"" experiences**: I was talking with an alumni who was attending sometime in the '90s or '00s.  She mentioned that she essentially spent a week with an outdoors club (associated with campus) prior to the start of school.  She said that she essentially spent the week backpacking and getting to know the people in that club.  While this may not be ideal for everyone, it offers an alternative that may be more compelling to some than the typical ""WOW"" experience.  There are already programs for students of certain ethnic backgrounds.  These sorts of custom WOW experiences should be explored and expanded.

Wow question/ changing groups,5,4,"Hey everyone so not to be a downer but I have a question. 

I’m a transfer student attending wow now and truthfully I’m not having that great of a time. Usually I’m the one in the group who is the “bump on the log” but in this case my group doesn’t seem to do much. Our only off campus planned activity was getting ice cream downtown on the first night. 

Our only other real activity other than the ones on campus (tye die, roller rink, and movie) and we were supposed to go swimming at the rec but couldn’t because our wow leaders didn’t check the schedule/ get us registered in time so us group members said screw it and went to the beach. 

Is this normal for wow groups? I’m hearing of all these other groups hiking/ kayaking and other cool activities. I’m trying to make some connections as that has always been a weak point of mine, but this event isn’t seeming super helpful. 

Any advice? I’m considering just trying to find another group but I also feel like it’s a bit late for that.

Bike locking tips?,5,8,"Hello. I’m pretty new to biking. I know how to ride a bike and traffic laws but I don’t know anything else.

One thing that’s important is obviously locking the bike. I’ve read that doing so incorrectly can lead to having some of your components being stolen, especially at a place like Cal Poly. So to minimize the chances of having anything stolen I plan to use two U-locks (two different brands, two different keys too), one cable lock (not sure if that’s what you call it, it’s the kind of hard to cut through cable). The seat will also be locked to the frame or something somehow using something (someone else doing this for me, I know nothing about bike-this person doesn’t know much about locking). So with these things how do I proceed to lock? It seems like you have to choose a really good place to lock like one of those inverted U permanently fixed to the ground bike parking place. But Cal Poly seems to have “regular” bike racks. I think the ones in front of the Rec-you can only have your front wheel attached and that’s it. So I should choose a better place? In front of which buildings do you recommend? And off campus they have inverted U types right?",98okj8,CalPoly

(RANT) Getting real pissed off at Cal Poly,114,29,"Is it just me or is anyone else getting increasingly mad at how bad Cal Poly is fucking us over this year.

First off with parking, first the parking passes are already incredibly expensive, then they decide to only have a limited number of them and you can't even buy daily passes for the lots that are half empty because you need the stupid fucking permit which sold out in 2 days. The only place for general parking now is literally by the P. And this would all be fine if the bus system was at least somewhat decent, but no we can't even get that. They've managed to make the bus system even worse than it was in previous years; most only run once an hour, but not even that is worse than the fact that they're always late by 10-20 minutes and always crowded by the new number of students living off campus.

That takes me to yet another point of how their gigantic fuck up leads to us having more crowded classes and even harder to get into them. Luckily I'm graduating soon so I don't have to deal with that as much, but what it does impact is the classes that are offered as well, so now I'm stuck with multiple classes that I need to graduate that haven't been offered in 2 years. And yet instead of addressing these problems they're over here building new dorms that are just going to increase the problems we're already having.

I honestly love this school, but it seems like the administration is running it into the ground disregarding students in hopes of more money. Every problem that I've experienced the past 3 years has just been accentuated this year and it's really pissing me off.

85% of PCV is going to be doubles,45,51,"Dear Student:


Poly Canyon Village self-assignment, initially set for this week, will begin instead on Tuesday, July 11. Your specific appointment day and time will be emailed to you a few days in advance of self-assignment. 

Looking ahead, we want to let you know that we received tremendous expressed interest from continuing students to live on campus, and a substantial response to the offer of admission from newly admitted freshmen. We’re making some necessary adjustments to room configurations and offerings across University Housing to serve all students who wish to live on campus. 

Here’s what this means for you, at self-assignment:

The majority of continuing student spaces, about 85%, will be six-person apartments with three double-suite bedrooms featuring bunked beds. The six-person double suite apartment is a cost-savings in comparison to the other configurations. View room configurations here.Subject to changes in enrollment, Aliso and Buena Vista will serve freshmen. All other buildings are reserved for continuing students.All spaces are first-come, first-served subject to availability.

We understand that campus housing is a secure option for some of you who may be ready to venture off-campus, but are concerned about finding a suitable place in the local housing market. If you are still open to an off-campus living option, you may be interested in an opportunity we’ve arranged with Mustang Village. Since only 15% of the available space in Poly Canyon Village will be in single bedrooms, Mustang Village may be a good alternative, especially if you are seeking a private bedroom. 


Through Monday, May 29, Mustang Village is holding available spaces for continuing Cal Poly students who have secured campus housing, but would like to live off campus. Most rooms are doubles. They also have private rooms. Students who choose this option will not pay the application fee or the difference in the cost of parking ($25). These fees will be covered by University Housing. To take advantage of this offer, contact Mustang Village directly at 805-793-0184 no later than May 29.  View Mustang Village rates and amenities, here.


If you no longer need campus housing, please let us know that by completing the online housing cancellation form.


You can view additional information about self-assignment here. Please feel welcome to reach out to us with questions.


Thank you,

2. Going off-campus is less costs with no meal plan and housing BUT I'll get less financial aid and local housing is real problem.

I honestly and realistically cannot afford $600-1000 a month for rent and that's not even including food or utilities.

This is my dilemma. 1. Stay on campus with more financial aid and more loans, or 2. go off-campus with less financial aid and high rent that I don't know where I'm going to get the money from.

Parking for Off-Campus Worker,1,5,"Hey guys, so this is a follow up on a couple previous posts concerning parking. Last year I had a parking pass in J lot and worked about an hour away; this was a bit of a pain but I got used to it over time. 

&#x200B;

This year I was really hoping to secure a better parking pass so that the commute would be easier. Luckily, I was able to get a pass that was closer, however it was for several lots, not one specific guaranteed spot lot in J lot. This pass gets me into lots A, D, T, W, and Hilltop. My main question would be which lot would be most reliable for parking when working about twice a week given these details: I will be living in Alumni this year, I would typically be leaving early morning before 9 and would be returning in the late evening around 9 as well. Parking at any of these lots will easily be easier than J lot obviously, but with the time I'll be returning at, I'm really hoping to not have to drive around campus to find parking. What would be most reliable for this? Thanks all!

I'm cool with everyone and don't mind partying environments and stuff like that. Actually, I go parties all the time. I FUC*KING love cars too. So if you see me changing my car every month don't freak out. Sometime I just buy fuc*ked up cars from craigslist and try to fix them though I end up fucking junking the car sometimes but thats okay. I'm a hard working guy. I'm working 3 jobs right now with a total of 80-90 hours a week. I run an online Amazon store where I sell Iphones and fancy shit for people who thinks Iphones are better than Androids. I also work as a driver for a pizza store plus at Dunkin ( I know you must be feeling me after the Dunkin part.) I also do some side jobs like fixing cars/moving/landscaping.  I'm a musician too.

Basically, what I'm trying to ask is are there any cool things to see or do? I like playing tennis, hiking, running, finding cool stores, etc. Really anything would be appreciated! Are there any cool small local stores around here? Any good trails to run on? Hiking trails? 

Thanks for any input guys!",31nxc0,UCONN

Need some advice on off-campus housing next semester.,0,2,"So a little background.  I currently hold an apartment in Vernon with a roommate.  I'm a transfer and currently a junior.  It's my second semester at UCONN and recently found out that my roommate (Who isn't a student) has to move because of a new job they got.

We currently pay $855, so after bills I pay ~$500 a month.  I took a break from working since my transfer to get used to the new workload so I don't work currently.  So there's no way I can renew the lease and pay it on my own.  It's a one bedroom so finding another roommate is out.

I'm unsure how to go about this because I don't want to live on campus and I'm pretty sure it's too late to get housing anyway.  I was thinking about going into a shared house.  Does anybody know the best way to go about this or have any advice for me?  I get about $8k back in grant/refunds for living expenses per semester.

Off campus roommate wanted!,9,4,"Hi guys, was told reddit might be able to help me out so here it goes. I am currently leasing a house that is 5 mins off campus, and we are looking for one more roommate for next year! Please pm me with any questions, but for now I'll try to list off the basics:

1. Male or female roommate; there are currently 2 males and 2 females, and we have room for one more person.

2. House is fully furnished and our current roommates who are leaving are willing to leave some furniture behind as well; very flexible there. 

3. There a a few rooms open to rent out, so you have a few options for which one you'd like to have as your bedroom.

4. Huge driveway, easily fit 5 cars in there daily, and could easily fit more.

5. Kinda mentioned earlier, but the house is literally five minutes off campus. We are located right by the depot campus, which is close to the end of Huntinglodge.

6. At the moment, rent is $520/month; this includes water and heating throughout the winter, which ended up being a huge relief financially. Only other utilities that we pay for are electricity/internet, which comes to around $40/month

7. The house has 2 FULL bathrooms; and we keep them nice and neat.

8. Washer and dryer in house, located right in our finished basement!

9. The house is 3 floors; 
finished basement which includes a room for washer/dryer, and a side room that we treat as a study. Mid floor has a large family room and complete kitchen, as well as the first bathroom and a glass screened porch and patio. Top floor is where the bedrooms and other bathroom are located. Hopefully I've made it clear how huge this place is.

I’m a complete noob when it comes to this and I just assume everyone who lives off campus has it very well off because I was looking at prices and Southgate says like 990-1000 something for a studio ?? Is that every month ? I’m sorry if I sound so ignorant but personally would like to live “off campus” maybe my senior year . I’m trying to be frugal of course so recommendations are welcomed , if there’s any places that allows pets that would be cool as well .

Incoming Freshman Guide from an Outgoing Freshman guide,39,13,"Hey guys,

I've seen a lot of people asking basic questions or not asking questions that I had when coming in so I'm going to try and do my best to display as much as I can.

&#x200B;

**Tiger Cash vs. Paw Points**

Both are currency LSU uses. Both are used mostly to purchase meals in dining areas but can also be used to buy things from campus stores like The Take 5 or 459 Outakes. The difference is that Tiger Cash rolls over to the next semester whereas Paw Points don't. You can see people frantically buying everyone meals at the end of the semester just so they don't waste all of the Paw Points they have left. You can reload Tiger Cash through kiosks around campus but I mainly use the one in the Union next to McDonald's. Tiger Cash can be used off campus in some fast food restaurants that allow it and can be used to pay for printer use in Middleton.

&#x200B;

**Will I have time to go out if I'm a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ major?**

Yes, the first semester is a lot of introductory classes that require minimal thinking. I am a Biochem/Psych double major and I went out almost twice a week and still managed to make the Dean's List. Now don't get me wrong I did study my ass off but I developed time management skills and turned out fine. My second semester was rough though and I tried to pick up my pace more so I ended up only going out about 4 times the whole semester, but the first semester I would say anyone can go out no matter the major. For every semester after the first its mostly every STEM major goes out once a week on the weekends, but if your business or mass comm or etc. you can pretty much go out as much as you want from what I've seen.

&#x200B;

**What is the best bar?**

For freshman its usually Reggies. As a Reggie rat, I have spent many of evenings my first semester there. Other than that I would personally go to Mikes or Fred's. Freds is the only bar in Tigerland with an age limit above 18. I think girls is 19 and guys is 20 if I'm not mistaken so you would probably need a fake to get in.

&#x200B;

**Will I do good if I got \_\_\_\_ ACT score and I'm 5'9"" and blah blah blah?**

Its all about time management and prioritizing. College is not that difficult if you are able to develop a new way to study/ do work. A lot of people make study groups when first coming in and trust me they barely work. Most of mine ended up making jokes the entire time or showing each other irrelevant videos. I ended up only working/studying in a group of people if it was for math or chemistry. Every other class I would study independently and I turned out fine. Most people that I know of study in 1st/2nd floor Middleton, 1st floor Union, or in the study rooms in their dorms. I wasn't in the Honors College my first semester but managed to sneak into Laville and study in the study rooms. There were a lot of people that I had classes with that lived there so they were nice enough to help me out with studying.

&#x200B;

**Tiger Lagniappe**

Tiger lagniappe is an incentive thing where every month if you use Tiger Cash at a location you get a good deal. I would regularly use these because I didn't have any pawprints and you could basically always get two for one deal in the Union or the Faculty Club

&#x200B;

**Free meals**

A lot of churches around campus offer free meals once a week. Use these to your advantage.

&#x200B;

**Where do I get a ""clicker""**

Depending on what classes you get, some professors will require a clicker which is basically an answering machine. These are about 30 dollars and are at the Bookstore. If you don't have one for a class that says it's mandatory then your basically screwed because professors that have them usually use them to count attendance/class participation grades.

&#x200B;

**Research / Work Study / Presidential's Aid**

I had a lot of problems with this my first semester. As an incoming student, I was not in the Honors College or had work study, but I wanted to work in a lab on campus. Many people I knew who had work-study weren't even going to their ""jobs"" that were assigned to them and LSU can only give out so much per semester. If end up not using your Work-Study make sure to contact the appropriate people so that people who need the money can work.

If you want to keep the work-study but don't enjoy the lab description, change it. You are able to actually find a faculty mentor underneath each departments faculty page that is doing research on a topic that you enjoy. After you find one just shoot them an email and say that you want to work in their lab. Most labs have no undergraduates working in them so a lot of professors are kind of desperate. If you don't want to look too hard like I did then you can go onto LSU Discover's Mentor Database where faculty mentors actually post position listings that you can apply for.

I ended up volunteering in a lab my first semester and carried out my own research on 3D reconstruction of thin connective tissue structures and ended up publishing an abstract in it for my second semester. It is so easy to excel in most labs if you put some amount of effort into them and treat them like a class (but you get paid for it). While I was volunteering I still kept all of my time sheets and when I received Work-Study I was able to get the 800 dollars worth of hours I had put into my work at the end of the semester. So even if you don't have Work Study you can volunteer in a lab and keep track of your time to be paid when you do receive it.

Continuing with my published abstract, my professor asked me if I wanted to present my research at a conference in Orlando, Florida. Of course, I said yes but I didn't have the money for it. LSU paid for my entire travel expense. They gave me 1000 to go to a science conference in Orlando, Florida to present my research through the Undergraduate Research Travel Stipend and it was an amazing experience highly recommend it. Looks great on resumes if you plan on applying to further education.

is the lodges at 777 a good place to live,2,16,"my cousins live there and they are renewing their lease, I am thinking about moving in with them. Is this a good place to live? Also is this better than the edward gay apartments on campus? and did any of you use your financial aid to pay for your apartment? I am asking because I am moving from Lafayette to Baton Rouge and I will not have a job when I move there, so my financial aid would have to help me while I look for work. I have some money but I may have to use all of it for a car as well. Also if you do not have a car, how do you mange to go to the store? I know they have tiger trails will only help with going to school. Is moving off campus better than staying in the East/West campus apartments? Any tips are welcome",c5hn4g,LSU
How bad are the Edward Gay Apartments?,2,34,"So I applied to LSU last minute (I didn't think I would get in, it took forever to convince myself to apply). I am now admitted and paid the enrollment fee, however, this means now I am late with applying for the apartments. Originally, I was just going to stay with my cousin, but now I figured out that she has 6 people already living there and adding a 7th we would struggle with food (they eat everything!). So now I am trying to get on the wait list for the East Campus Apartments and the West Campus Apartments. I spoke to the people in housing and they say the on campus apartments are 60% full and to name my top 3 choices, I listed the WCA, ECA (both are furnished), and the Edward Gay Apartments (unfurnished), and as a last resort I'd be willing to live in the dorms (not looking at them because beggars can't be choosy). They told me my best bet would be the Ed gay apartments because the application for that apartment opens on June 3rd. But I just read an article that says the Ed gay apartments need to be tore down because it's old, you have to keep your air condition on 70  because if you lower it in the summer mold will grow on the walls. I also heard that the apartments have small roaches (which are hard to get rid of). IDK what to do, if I stay with my cousin, I might have to fight for food and have no privacy. I can't afford off campus apartments because I have no Job but I have money, but they said I would need a co-sign ( which i have no one to co sign), I am not from baton rouge so I can scratch out a roommate (unless it's a random from the internet).  Are the Ed Gay Apartments that bad? Also, should I stay on the wait list and still fill out the Ed Gay Apartments as a last resort? If it helps, I am a 25 yr old transfer (I'm Transferring in as a Junior). Any tips or advice is welcomed.",bv23it,LSU
Looking for not shithole apartments near LSU and don't cost my entire tuition,13,35,"I can't afford on campus housing, but I can budget for an off campus apartment.

:( College is the most boring thing I've ever done in my life,16,57,"Hey guys,

I'm an Interior Design Freshman. I came to LSU knowing absolutely no one. I'm from Washington State so everything is different here; weather, food, culture, people, etc. I have definitely gotten homesick a lot but I cant go home on the inbetween holidays, only Christmas and Summer. I just stick to calling my parents and boyfriend (at MIT) in the evenings. Honestly, I didn't get to go out a lot in highschool because I always had a job or some volunteering or sport to do, as well as strict parents and friends who would only ever make last minute plans. Now, I have all the free time in the world, no strict parents breathing down my neck, and I'm truly out making an effort to meet new people and go to events, but I can never seem to get past acquaintance level with people. My roommate is fine, but she's a total homebody (she has a car but she never wants to go anywhere with me and I don't want to walk around alone in the evenings) and I hate staying in doing nothing. I need something to do but I have no car (it's back in Washington) and everything costs money I don't have (if I can't use paw points, I can't pay for it).

I considered rushing, but the drinking/party culture really isn't my style and I don't have enough money for dues or the outfits and events they seem to constantly be out doing. I have joined a few clubs, but they often conflict with one another, so I'm down from the original ones I was a part of to only a handful. Plus, the friends I've made in my studio class and clubs are mostly commuters, so outside of class no one's really around. My main club has tried getting together multiple times at one girl's house, but for whatever reason we can't manage to get our shit together enough to have even one casual get together happen even if we plan it like two weeks in advance. The campus ministries have been absolutely lovely to me, but I still always feel a bit off, like I just can't truly let loose and be happy. Honestly, the strongest emotion I get from being here is boredom :(  . I went to a football game, but it really (no offense to the players, they work hard and I appreciate them) sucked entertainment wise, they spend more time off the field than on and honestly the golden girls are way more fun to see. 

I just feel like there's nothing to do around here and I can't get close enough to anyone to feel like I'm really making friends. I feel like I just can't truly connect with girls (I was pretty much only close with guys in high school and I haven't met any girl that I can truly be myself around. I end up acting wayyy to formal and reserved. As for guys, I've literally only felt like I'm getting hit on if I talk with them more than a few times.) Honestly the lack of proper and comfortable socialization has made me so depressed I can't get by a single day on less than 11 hours of sleep and it absolutely drains me. On top of that I don't know where anything is off campus and I have literally no personal money at all. I started the semester off fine, but at this point, it just sucks.",a05fd2,LSU

A Documentation of the Best Places to Shit on Campus (Men's Restrooms),183,87,"Unfortunately, this record can only contain reviews on places I have shit, therefore, expect several edits to this post. If you have your own reviews of halls not listed, please add to the archive.

Student Union - Second Floor: Serves its purpose. Not particularly awful, but not exactly an eye-opening experience either. 5/10

Allen Hall - First Floor: Smells kind of funny, and looks like it holds the chamber of secrets. The stalls are dark, but hey, maybe you're into that kind of thing. The backpack hooks work just fine, and the doors lock, which is more than can be said for most places. The toilet paper is awful though. 7/10

Patrick F. Taylor - Any are good honestly: An unforgettable experience. The stalls are clean and all lock properly, lighting is good, all the backpack hooks don't cause the door to swing open like other places, and I swear the toilet paper is actually decent quality. The fact that there are several bathrooms here only adds to the magnificence. My personal favorite is the one near Panera Bread. 10/10.

Middleton Library - First Floor: A strange experience. Only some of the stall doors lock, and the whole place looks like a news headline waiting to happen. The toilet paper is the same shitty paper from Allen, though at least the bathroom is usually quiet. 3/10

Tureaud Hall - First Floor: A nice, clean, quiet place to shit. the stall doors lock in my experience. The thing of greatest concern is that a few of the stalls have glory holes, but hey, who doesn't love a neighborly chat through the glory hole while you and your boys shit? 9/10

Lockett Hall - First Floor: A nightmarish hellscape. The restroom is filthy, none of the stall doors lock, the toilet paper has the strength of freeze-dried kleenex, and the stalls appear to have been designed for tiny gremlins. To top it all off, the toilets soak you with a waterfall of water when you flush. It also has a weird massive urinal that looks more like a bathtub. 0/10

Edit: Coates Hall now included

Coates Hall - First Floor: Have you ever been in a 7/11 at midnight, and experienced how off the place is? That's what this bitch feels like at 7:30 in the morning, just a toxic air of unholiness about it. The stalls are pretty massive, which is a huge plus, but the door of the handicap stall often blocks the path to the urinals, so you have to play a minigame to access your piss bucket. The mirrors and sinks are in pretty rough shape and the toilet paper is plentiful. I was unable to locate the glory holes in the bathroom, much to my disappointment. 6/10

Edit 2: The floors I am reviewing have been clarified, and I have added a few more

Williams Hall - First Floor (Female Restroom, Not my experience): The main door is reportedly always open, and there are only three or four stalls. They share many of the same designs of Lockett stalls. The overall room is tiny, it smells weird,, the lighting isn't bad and it is usually pretty clean. Toilet paper sucks, as per usual. Even the handicap stall is small, so expect no saving grace, and the doors are a disgusting orange color. 5/10.

Student Union - First Floor (Unisex), across from McDonalds: One of the first bathrooms I ever used on campus, so forgive my inevitable nostalgia bias. It is a single person bathroom, which is always welcome, and the room is fairly well lit. The restroom isn't exactly the cleanest, and again, the toilet paper sucks, but its what you gotta do to get some privacy around here. The walls are pretty thin, so don't blow it up too hard if you don't want stares and/or cheers when you exit. 8/10

What makes campus drivers so impatient? Don't you hate how it makes you feel?,44,5,"So today I'm sitting at the intersection of S. Campus and Highland on my bike waiting for the light. Two cars in front of me, a silver Nissan Versa and behind it a mid-2000s Jeep Wrangler. Lady in the Jeep is fully losing her shit because the Nissan in front of her won't turn right and block the crosswalk so she can keep going. Honking, yelling, beating on her steering wheel, revving the engine so hard I had to back up to avoid being gassed, all that. I've never seen someone so angry in a car in my life.

Similarly, I've had cars pull into opposing traffic to pass me on Dalrymple between Tower and Field House and all along S. Stadium. I get it - bikes are slower than cars as a general rule. When I ride on River Road it's safe and legal to cross the line to pass me, and I always encourage you to do so because I don't like being in front of you any more than you like being behind me. But on campus when I'm hopping between classes using the road I'm doing 22-25mph because it feels great and I don't have to hold that speed for more than a few minutes. If you're going fast enough to pass me in the opposing lane on campus you're going to kill someone to save no time at all.

Why would anyone drive on campus at all if they get that mad at being held up for a bit? It's a campus, you're going to stop at ten crosswalks and emergency brake for at least two dopes stepping off the sidewalk on their phones on your way across it anyway. If it's that bad go park near the outskirts of campus and walk to where you need to be. It's lovely this time of year and it'll give you the time you apparently so desperately need to relax.",dq0uuf,LSU

I apologize for another housing post (x-posted to r/batonrouge),3,6,"Hello all.  I'm moving to Baton Rouge for grad school and I need to find a place for 8/1.  I'm in my mid 30s and married with a 2 year old. Ideally we would like to find a house for rent in a reasonably affordable and safe area. I've been scouring Craigslist, the LSU off campus site, and some other sites as well as looking for property management company websites. We currently live in Atlanta but are planning to come down this weekend to look more. Friends who used to live in Baton Rouge have told me to look in south downs, the garden district and Capitol heights. My wife will likely work at a hospital if that makes a difference. 

We would ideally be by a park in a neighborhood with other young families, would prefer a back yard with a fence, and want to spend around 1100 per month, or less if possible. 

Where we live now a lot of places don't even get advertised, and are rented with a sign in the yard or word of mouth. Would we be better off driving around and looking? Also are there other neighborhoods we should be looking at?

How do you feel about new gates around campus Indian Mounds?,20,18,"I've been at LSU for several years, and the Campus Mounds have always been accessible to passerby, except on gamedays I believe, as they started roping them off on Saturdays during the football season in 2010 so that people would stop setting up tailgates directly on them. It is my understanding that there have been several plaques around the area over the years asking that people respect the mounds and not slide down them (as was a longstanding tradition), but honestly I can't even remember ever seeing any of these plaques specifically. I've definitely seen people sitting, studying, praying, etc. on the mounds as individuals or in small groups, but in the time I've been here I can't ever remember seeing anyone doing anything majorly destructive or seen any huge groups congregating on top of them. At the very least, in daylight hours during the school week, people have always seemed to treat these spots with a degree of respect and courtesy. As for myself, I don't think I've ever even walked over one of them, as I usually walk to class alone and would have no real reason too, especially if I didn't see people on them. 

But within the last month or so, they've now erected tall metal fences around each one with 2 different signs posted all around their perimeters, one citing their historical significance and another (in official LSU department colors and lettering) warning: NO TRESPASSING. So I'm assuming that they're making it an official rule now that students and other local community members are not allowed within the gates or on the mounds themselves. I've looked up what the new rules are, but cannot find any information regarding what the actual consequences are if you are caught trespassing, but it seems like they may be taking this seriously. I'm wondering what people think about this? The mounds may be over 9,000 years old, as they are claiming, and it's confirmed that they do have some major internal structural damage, but that is from decades of there being no efforts to maintain the area or prevent huge groups of tailgaters to set up camp on them. They only even installed the short brick wall that surrounds the general area and separates it from the streets and parking lots in the 80s, after a student who was sitting on top of one of the mounds was run over and killed by a car driving over it. The weight of a few students occasionally walking over the mounds or studying on them is not doing any major damage. 

Anyway, I'm wondering how people feel about this? Do older students who are used to having access to the mounds feel like the campus community has a claim to the area, or do they not care that it is being taken away? How do people feel about the new gates?",dbgy2l,LSU

Advice for a Transfer student?,3,6,"Hey Reddit. I am an International Studies/Political Science major and a sophomore. I just transferred from a school in Atlanta, GA on account of family issues and the fact I injured my knee. :(
I am a local to Baton Rouge and my family has lived in the area for generations. So as far as knowing the city, I know it like the back of my hand.
But I know close to nothing about LSU. I get so turned around on campus and I'm unsure of how to find out about clubs/events/ etc. Also, as a transfer student, making friends seems a bit awkward. My old university was tiny so I made friends easily in my classes. Classes are so much bigger here.
I do already have quite a few friends that go to LSU, but I would like to make a lot more. I also live off campus, so there goes socializing in dorm settings. :/

Where is the busiest location on campus? (Maybe free plants?),17,9,"I'm with a nonprofit called the Collegiate Plant Initiative, and we're trying to find the busiest location on campus. Why? Well, we are interested in giving away 1,000 plants for free to students!

It's extremely nice and 10 minutes from LSU's campus. Rent is $600 a month with full utilities (washer, dryer, internet, electricity). The landlord is super cool and rent is paid on a month to month basis. You don't have to sign a lease but I need at least a 2 month notice from you before you move out just so I can start looking for somebody else to fill the room. I would prefer other LSU students but I'm open to other people moving in too.

I’ve found 2 of my past Roomate’s on this subreddit and now I’m hoping to find a 3rd. If you’re interested text me at (504) 418-4583.

LSU Campus Police Are Now Carrying Assault Rifles. Discovered while playing Pokemon Go.,5,25,"Note: I wrote this yesterday, before today's shootings in this city.

I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I like Pokemon Go. I began hearing rumors that going to the Louisiana State University campus was like walking into a treasure trove of Pokemon. So, last night, six friends and I decided to go down to campus and check it out. We got there at around 8 pm, and we had a blast. There were so many Poke Stops that I would miss one just trying to get another. It was glorious. I got a lot of exercise walking around, and we socialized with a bunch of people I probably never would have met otherwise. There were a lot of people playing in the most poke-dense areas.

One of my friends had a phone on the verge of battery death, so at around 10 pm, we walked to one of our cars to snag a quick charge. We hung around the car for about 20 minutes in a well-lit, open parking lot near the North Gate entrance to the university. We all sat with crossed legs in a nearby area, safe from vehicles and foot traffic. There weren't many people nearby, although we were in a generally well-trafficked area. We were having a good time chatting, but by no means were we doing anything to draw attention.

I was consumed by my phone as one of my buddies looked up. He was a bit concerned. A campus police vehicle was pulling into the parking lot with a hurry. The law enforcement mini-SUV pulled into the parking lot, passed us up by about 30 feet, and two campus police officers exited the vehicle. Those of us who were paying attention thought that perhaps they were there to shoo us away. Only half of us were aware of the situation until everyone heard a loud clicking noise. It was the sound of the campus police cocking an assault rife.

We would have gotten in the car and left campus immediately if there had been enough room in the vehicle for everyone, but as we were a group of seven, we settled for swiftly walking away. Any notion that they were simply there to shoo us away was gone. In fact, it began to seem like they may not have been concerned with our presence much at all. Either way, we obviously needed to get out of there. We headed toward a more populated area by the clock tower, keeping an eye on the campus police the whole time. After cocking the assault weapon, the two officers walked around the side of the LSU Continuing Education building that faces Highland Road. It felt like they weren't there for more than two or three minutes before they got back in their vehicle and drove further into campus. We were left with a lot to contemplate.

First of all, we all know the social climate in our city is dicey at best right now. Citizens have been killed by police in our city and others, and police have been killed by citizens here as well. Everyone's tense, and we get it. A cop with a family and a boss telling him he has to do what is necessary to stay safe and keep the people safe will do what he is led to believe he has to do. Thus, the assault weapon. I disagree with the conclusion, but I understand the persepective. I'm afraid that's a best-case speculation, though, as the reasoning could have been less noble on the officer's part. I do not know, so I try to give ample leeway for understanding.

That being said, is an assault rifle necessary? Since Alton Sterling was killed by a member of the Baton Rouge police 11 days ago, social unrest has surely been strong in our city. Outside of the recent protests, though, life has gone on barely different from normal for many of the people in Baton Rouge. I'm sure some of the police feel threatened by their own people, and that is as much a shame as the fear stricken in our hearts by the few uniformed men who have chosen to threaten us. Just keep in mind that 'few' is the key word here. The numbers may have grown, but it does not have to extend beyond the few if we so choose. Regardless, is the minute chance that something could go down on this particular night at this particular location worth the social message being sent by a uniformed man carrying a government-sanctioned assault weapon in public, seemingly unprovoked?

Our thoughts delved deeper, trying to unravel the situation further. Only one police vehicle showed up to the undisturbed location. If there were some legitimate concern that brought them there, why was theirs the only vehicle to show up? It makes sense that only one car would arrive for a minor report, but if it were a minor report, why would they need an assault weapon?

Our minds shot questions more quickly than we could fully conceive them. The officers were only there for a few minutes at most. If they did need such a weapon, why would they take such little time to clear a threatening area alone?

The officer cocked the gun only after he exited the vehicle, and he did so with a fair bit of energy. It made me feel as though, to some degree, he were proud of what he held in his hands. I don't like the idea of our public servants being proud to handle such weapons, as any situation which would necessitate them is nothing to value.

Another gravely concerning point to me is the fact that all of this took place on public school grounds. Our city's children, our future, surrounded this man for blocks as he handled an assault rifle with seemingly no provocation. There were a fair bit of us around playing Pokemon Go, sure, but I personally didn't hear of a single disturbance.

Lastly, going hand in hand with the previous point, these were not normal city police. They weren't members of the sheriff's office. These two men were campus police. Something about this fact disturbs me on a level that I am having a hard time expressing in organized language.

We need to ensure our children's safety. We need to protect one another. When the uniform is off, a member of the police force is not separate from you or I. Ideally, they wouldn't be separate while in uniform, but we do not live in an ideal world. Regardless, we need to protect those who protect us. If we don't, we help to foster the prevalent us-versus-them mentality. The more that any people view any group as separate from themselves, the less compelled they are to understand, and the further entrenched they become in their own preconcieved notions. This is how cracks become canyons. Canyons consume cities. Consumed cities cannot hold up a nation. Our police are very important, whether you love it or hate it, and I would wager that a large majority of them only do what they feel is necessary to keep the peace. There are no sides. There is only meaningless death and there is prosperity. We can have whichever we choose. We do not need our government telling us whether we are allowed to have guns or not, but it is certainly time to put them away and choose with our voices.

TL;DR Playing Pokemon Go on LSU campus a couple nights ago. Two cops showed up, one holding an assault rifle. He looked proud to carry it. We got out of there. This was before the murder of police officers today in our city.",4taeu3,LSU
New LSU grad student looking for help finding a place to live.,4,20,"I'm looking for suggestions on where to search for a place to live for the next two years while I'm in grad school. I'm moving from out of state and and want to start my lease in August 2016. I don't want to have to move out of a shitty place halfway thru my thesis, so I want to find somewhere great off the bat. I would prefer to rent a condo or townhome on the south east side of campus, hopefully close by to the lake or a nice park. Walking distance of groceries would be a plus. 

I'm married, and we're the stay at home type. We want somewhere quiet quiet quiet and where nobody is going to be coming knocking. I want it to be somewhere where my wife can go out alone and feel safe. I'm leaning away from a rental home because I don't want to deal with the lawncare.

Looking for something from $700-$900 a month. We could go one bedroom or two, but I want at least 1.5 bathrooms. An ideal place would have a single, large bedroom. The place needs to have cable service. Not sure how the ISPs are in BR yet.

Any suggestions would be great!",4fozws,LSU
(x-post /r/LSUfootball) Help for a group of Gators coming to Death Valley for the game in October,14,17,"Hey y'all! Me and a group of buddies are going to be coming to Baton Rouge for the UF game this fall. We're all UF alumni (plus one UGA alumnus) in our late 20s/early 30s, we're all friendly and we love to drink and eat, and none of us have ever been to a game at LSU. We're just getting into planning everything, and I had some questions I was hoping you could help with. 

First, ticket stuff:

* What sections do away fans generally sit in?
* Are there any other sections that would be relatively friendly to non-asshole visiting fans?
* Are there any sections that we should definitely avoid, either because they're too hostile or they're otherwise not worth sitting in?
* Are we better off buying tickets online ahead of time, or taking our chances scalping the day of? (And if we have 8-12 people wanting to sit together or in a couple groups, does that change things?)

Non-ticket stuff: we're planning on staying in New Orleans Thursday and Friday nights, then driving to BR Saturday morning. We're all flying out of New Orleans Sunday late morning/afternoon. I'm kind of working under the assumption that the game will be 3:30, but feel free to give advice for a night game as well.

* How early do we need to get to Baton Rouge on Saturday morning?
* Where is the best place to park? (We're not planning on tailgating much or any near our cars, just looking for cheap/convenient places)
* What parts of campus do we want to visit to get the LSU tailgating experience?
* What are the open container rules (if any) like on game day? Is it different for opposing fans?
* We're planning on bringing booze and some other basic bartering supplies--are we likely to be able to join in LSU fans' tailgates? How welcoming are y'all to opposing fans? Anything we need to know to do or not do?
* If tailgating doesn't work out, or if we want to get some food from a restaurant before or after the game, any suggestions?
* If we decide to hit up bars on game day, any suggestions?
* We got hotel reservations in both NO and BR for Saturday night, and we're trying to decide which to cancel. How annoying is it to get from BR to NO on a Saturday evening after the game? Is it worth just staying in Baton Rouge that night and making the drive Sunday morning?
* Any other advice you have!",3j8orh,LSU

Help brainstorming a name for my new organization on campus!,0,0,"Hey Tigers!

A few girls and I are starting a new organization on campus. As of right now we are using the name Tiger Sweethearts, however, if we can think of a more original creative name we would love to use that instead.

The club/ organization will be a sisterhood that is dedicated to philanthropy and scholarship. I understand many Greek Sororities on campus also concentrate on this, however the Tiger Sweethearts will be for girls who would like to do volunteer work for the community as well as better themselves with their ""sisters"" without having to go to an exchange every week.

There will be a rush process but it will be entirely based off of GPA, a single paper for the girl to explain how she can contribute to the organization, and just three rush events. Nothing will be based on appearance and the members will be forbidden from saying anything negative about the girls they are rushing.

The philanthropy is to better the state of Louisiana and the community of Baton Rouge. Every interest and major will have a volunteer opportunity catered to them. We have the Garden Project in Baton Rouge, Volunteer Health Corps, Brave, and many other local organizations to work with. The Tiger Sweethearts will be making opportunities available to the sisters through planned (optional) volunteer projects.

Scholarship wise we will be providing opportunities for girls to meet with other people in their majors, form study groups, trade notes with people who have already taken the class, and more group oriented opportunities such as guest speakers from graduate schools and different careers. We will be working hard to help every girl excel in school.

This organization is meant to foster a feeling of community and will work with the ""pay it forward"" idea of helping others. Kindness will be expected and drama and cruelty will not be tolerated.

The officers and I still need to complete the full constitution for the organization, but if anyone is interested, please send me an email! We still have openings for the founding leadership positions!

TL;DR If anyone could help me brainstorm a name for a sisterhood focused on community philanthropy, scholarship, and kindness, please let me know your ideas!",1oasxb,LSU
Wondering what resources I have...,0,1,"I was hoping maybe one of you could point me in the right direction with an issue I have been having on campus lately. I have a certain foreign language teacher who will place his/her hands on students as he/she walks throughout the class room. I have asked him/her several times not to touch me. I understand there may be some culture clash here, but I do not feel it is really an excuse if I have asked specifically not to be touched.

Specifically - it happened twice today in the same class period. So it's obvious that he/she did not make an effort to not touch me within a 30 minute period.

My question is - Which superior or agency within LSU should I contact about this?

I was thinking about it and trying to blow it off - but I realized that if a stranger touched me on the street and I asked him/her not to, yet he/she did it again - I would scream and file a police report the second time. And my rights not to be touched shouldn't end just because I'm in class... but that being said I don't want my grades to be affected... especially with the subjectivity associated with grading oral exams...",1chxpb,LSU

Place to live off Campus with respect to getting to the Kelley School of Business,5,7,"Hi friends,

My endgoal is to find an apartment that is best suited for a grad student going to the Kelley School of Business. I have looked at availability to the west of the School along 10th Street, but wanted your input before I focused my search. Perhaps there is high crime in that area, or perhaps parking is a nightmare and you wished you lived somewhere else despite the proximity to the Kelley School of Business. What it boils down to is I am trying to find the best location.

My criterion, in order of importance are:

1.	Proximity / Most Direct / or best way to get to the Kelley School of Business.
2.	Being able to bike and walk to the School.
3.	Safe neighborhood.

A little background:
-Talking with dorm managers about my situation, looks like living off campus is the best option.
-Looked at GPSG and some other sites, but wanted input on this post to narrow a location down.
-Really do not want to drive.

Thank you for your time. I feel like I have exhausted all of my immediate resources and still feel like I need more information. If I could enlist your experience, I would sincerely appreciate it.
Thanks!

I have asked my manager about the parking situation, but he gave me a bunch of non-answers. I went on the parking operations website, and I could only purchase passes for this summer. 

Is there a cheaper option for RPS employees other than shelling out hundreds of dollars for a permit? ",6bpr07,IndianaUniversity
The Freshman's Guide to IU: Food,24,27,"**FOOD**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, credit to a deleted account that made and original post [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/j97io/freshman_clothes_food_tailgating/), but that one wasn’t really tailored to freshmen, and wasn't as detailed. Being that you are presumably freshmen, this will cater to those with the meal plans that most freshmen get.  It will also consider the off-campus locations, as well as grocery stores in the area.

&nbsp;

**ON CAMPUS**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some VERY good places to eat on campus, and the meal plans will cover most of them.  There are, however, a couple places that meal plans will NOT cover. The two most noteworthy are the food courts in the basement of Wells Library and the Memorial Union.

[HERE]( http://www.rps.indiana.edu/menushours.cfml) is a link to the RPS website that shows the different locations of food options on campus, as well as the hours for each of those locations.
It is important when browsing to take note of whether it is a small café with limited options, or it is a full-fledged cafeteria with many options of full meals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, you understand that there are three primary locations for students to live – the Central, Northwest, and Southeast neighborhoods. Each of these has one primary food court that’s open most hours of the day and has many options of meals, and all of them have other places (that can be hard to find) that have other options for food, and are more convenient.

&nbsp;

[**Central Neighborhood**]( http://www.rps.indiana.edu/menushourscentral.cfml#)

**Wright Food Court (WFC)** – It is by far the largest cafeteria on campus. It has a good variety of food options, and is open as long as most places on campus.  A couple good things about WFC are that it’s the most centrally located food court, so it can be very convenient (especially to those that live in the central neighborhood), and that it is in fact VERY large, so there’s usually no worries about finding a place to sit – it’s often a hot spot for card-playing and other type of games since there are a lot of tables and it’s quite open.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the central neighborhood, there are other places to gather food, and a couple stores.  Two to take note of are the Hoosier Café & Store. They have one at Wright and Eigenmann.  The one at Wright is open until midnight, which is very handy. 

&nbsp;

[**Northwest Neighborhood**](http://www.rps.indiana.edu/menushoursnorthwest.cfml#)

**Gresham Food Court at Foster** – This is the Northwest’s equivalent of Wright Food Court.  While it isn’t as big as WFC, it is the largest cafeteria in the Northwest Neighborhood, and is the go-to place for meals. Finding a table can be tricky at prime hours, but it is usually not a problem.

**Edmonson Dining Room at Collins** - A bit away from the rest of the Northwest Neighborhood, Edmonson is a great place to eat delicious *and* healthy food. It sits on Woodlawn with the rest of Collins, and can be very convenient for those in [SoIC](https://www.soic.indiana.edu/), as well as people traveling north from the Memorial Union. Nobody has anything negative to say about this place. A great dining option.

**Hoosier Café & Store at McNutt** – This is probably the best Hoosier Café/Store on campus.  They have a customized deli sandwich station, and a large selection of packaged foods available. Immediately beyond the checkout area is also a large lounge with tables/chairs, as well as comfortable couches and lounge chairs to eat and hang out. There’s even a television for solo entertainment.

There are a couple other places to eat that you can explore, but these are the main three.

One of the hidden gems of campus food is also located here – The Crimson Creamery. This is underneath the Gresham building, and they have a fantastic selection of ice cream. They’re open until 11 p.m., which makes it great for an evening date with your friends or SO’s.

&nbsp;

[**Southeast Neighborhood**](http://www.rps.indiana.edu/menushourssoutheast.cfml#)

**The Restaurants at Woodland** – This place JUST made its way onto campus, and I hear FANTASTIC things about it.  It is the largest food court in the Southeast Neighborhood, and they have a great selection of food that can be tailored to your desires.

**El Bistro** – This is another sandwich place (with a couple other options nearby) that is located on the basement floor (it is accessible from the outside) of Read’s Beck Wing. This is a very convenient place to eat in between classes. It is fairly small, but not as many people tend to go here.

Like the others, this neighborhood has other options that you can see on the website.

&nbsp;

**Classroom Buildings**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of places to eat that are more near where you’re going to have classes, and these are great to keep an eye out for.

*Ballantine Hall Café* is a great place on the first floor of Ballantine Hall.  They do an e-meal thing so you can have a sandwich being made as you wait for class to let out (you’ll inevitably have a class in Ballantine Hall), or you can wait in line. It’s up to you.

*Herman B. Wells Library Commons*  is currently under construction, and should be completed for the beginning of Fall 2014 classes. It isn’t going to be a huge cafeteria, but there should be a decent food selection in this café on the first floor. (Bagels have always been clutch in Wells Library)
Again, there are plenty more places to eat on campus. Visit the website and take good note.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OFF CAMPUS**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the fun is. Bloomington is VERY well known for its great selection of food, and you can find it off-campus.  While the meal plans offered to freshmen are fantastic, campus food is simply going to get boring after a while, and you’re going to want to explore what Bloomington has to offer, and that’s great!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of franchise options (Taco Bell, KFC, McDonald’s), but you’re more than capable of figuring out where those are yourself, and you know exactly how those work, so I’m going to go ahead and dive right in.

*When in doubt, head West!*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the food options can be found toward the center of town (which if you haven’t figured out by now, is west of campus).  There is a GREAT selection of ethnic food to be found on fourth street, and there are some great local shops on Kirkwood (5th street) as well.

&nbsp;

**Pizza!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, you surely have heard of Bloomington’s pizza selection, so let’s break that down:

* [**Mother Bear’s**](http://www.motherbearspizza.com/) – undoubtedly the most famous of local pizza places. It’s hard to argue that this isn’t the best pizza in town. It’s usually always busy, and they have some truly great pizza. The only downside is that you’re going to pay good money for it.

* [**Aver’s**](http://www.averspizza.com/) – Aver’s sometimes flies under the radar, but make no mistake, they have some incredible pizza. They have award winning custom pizzas (such as the Cream & Crimson) that are definitely worth a try. (editor’s note: The Aver’s BBQ Chicken pizza is my favorite pizza offering in Bloomington)

* [**Pizza X**](http://www.pizzaxbloomington.com/) – Pizza X is a staple. You’re going to start collecting Pizza X cups very quickly.  There’s nothing wrong with the Pizza, and if you follow them on Twitter, you might catch a bargain every now and then. It's more franchised and not as meticulous about the pizza as the other two (there are multiple locations in town), but it's still decent pizza. With this place, breadsticks are the grail. The Little 5 deal (8 Breadsticks, 2 sauces, drink) is what it’s all about.

And of course, there are the franchise places as well in Bloomington, as well as a couple other custom shops.

Here’s a list of other available restaurants in Bloomington (all great):

Coffee Shops -

* [Soma](http://www.iheartsoma.com/)
* City Bakery (located on 3rd & Jordan)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm leaving out a few restaurants, but that's okay. Remember, try as much as you can if it seems appealing. FOURTH STREET has so many different ethnic foods to try, and they're mostly all good.

&nbsp;

**Grocery Stores**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marsh and Kroger are the two largest grocery stores in town, and there are multiple locations for either on campus. Kroger tends to be cheaper than Marsh, and it's best you get a Kroger card now (you'll use it for the next 3 years). Grocery stores are a much cheaper place to stock up on non-perishable food items that you can store in your room, provided you're running low on meal points.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I hope this guide has been helpful. Again, I'm willing to make edits as necessary.

&nbsp;

The one thing I've saved for last is this: [Btown Menus](https://btownmenus.com/). This place can have some really good deals if you watch for them, and it is a great hub to order food for takeout and delivery. If you like to eat take-out or delivery, use this place liberally.

"Housing, International Student",4,14,"I am a German student studying at IU for the year 16/17 and am lucky enough to get a 5000 dollar scholarship for housing. I want to have a good time and meet a lot of people while I'm in America, so I considered on-campus living. However, I can only live at Willkie, Ashton, Evermann or Union Street, at least I think so. Any recommendations? 

I thought about the pros of having a stove to cook, which union street has, but then again it's the most expensive one. Anyway, if anyone has lived at those houses I'd love to hear your opinion. 

Or is off-campus providing me with a similar chance of a traditional American college experience?

Help with late apartment searching...,4,6,"So after my first year I planned on rooming in the dorms again... without going into detail I'm not and will be living in an apartment.

I feel like I am scrambling at the last second and late to the game in snagging an apartment for next year. There is still a month and a half left before move in days on campus, but I just feel as though I'm still late because I've never searched for apartments before and don't know how much time in advance is needed to rent.

I'm not really looking for recommendations of actual apartments (but if you have one you think would help then go ahead and comment). Im simply looking for tips on the process.

The Freshman's Guide to IU: Extracurricular Activities,10,4,"###EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you’ve moved in and you understand how a lot of things work, and you’ve got the handle on your classes, you’re going to be looking for things to do, so let’s go ahead and try to highlight a few things and help you out.

-	**Don’t be afraid to talk to people** – Most of the things you’re going to do are going to involve other people if it’s happening outside your dorm room. Sure, there are introverted people that like their alone time, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. But if that’s not you, you’re going to want to just TALK to people. Extracurricular activities revolve around other people, and the quickest way to get involved is to have a friend that invites you to do something.

&nbsp;

##SRSC, WIC, AND INTRAMURALS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re of the athletic type, my friends and I have always said your goal should be to not come out of IU without at least one of the RS CHAMPIONS t-shirts. (Mine came in 2012 co-ed softball at the fields that are now replaced by the new baseball/softball stadiums.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intramural sports at IU are simply all awesome.  There’s a wide range of options that you can see [here]( http://www.iurecsports.org/intramural_sports). They range from basketball, to waterpolo, and even Quidditch (Yes, that’s not a joke. It’s fun. Go watch it sometime.).  There are a few solo/doubles sports that you can sign up for and compete in, and there are a lot of team sports.  If you’re a solo looking for a team, there’s a sheet you can sign up on and they will pair you with a team that’s looking for people – this is another great way to meet new people and make new friends.  If you have a group of people that you like and think would be good at an activity, you can all sign up as one team.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At both the WIC (Wildermuth Intramural Center) and SRSC (Student Recreational Sports Center), there are pickup basketball games ALWAYS going on. You can show up with anywhere from 1-5 people, and it won’t take long before you’re in the game.  This works the same as nearly every other pickup basketball complex you’ve been to – the games are usually to 15 or 20, there are always going to be people taking it way too seriously, and every [stereotype in pickup basketball]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gWxHFMog9w) will be there.  The WIC tends to have more basketball games going on at once.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these facilities also have a good weightlifting/exercise rooms (The SRSC’s are much larger). Both of them also have a pool that you are able to swim in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are locker rooms available in both buildings and there are locks that you can rent. However, toward the end of last year there was a string of robberies (people were writing down serial numbers and unlocking other people’s locks) going on. People suck, you know this.  So if you have your own lock, it would be best to bring that.

&nbsp;

##INDIANA UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS

**INDIANA UNIVERSITY MEN’S BASKETBALL**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t really think I need to explain the hype behind IUBB.  The first and most important thing you should do if you haven’t already is attend a Hoosier Hysteria.  Hoosier Hysteria is a great way to help you truly understand how much support IUBB has, and how many people are absolutely crazy about it. I haven’t seen college basketball in every building in the country, but I have in a few. And from my experiences, and from the guys on ESPN that cover college basketball, there is absolutely no environment like that of Assembly Hall on gameday when it comes to college basketball.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In registering for classes, you’ll have the option to buy season tickets. If you want them, that’s going to be the only way to get them. But aside from that, you can find tickets on Craigslist, as well as the [IUBB Student Ticket Exchange]( https://www.facebook.com/pages/IU-Basketball-Student-Ticket-Exchange/171393299614832).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To everyone that isn’t a basketball fan, I’d recommend seeing at least ONE game, just to try and have an understanding of what goes on. It’s expected that you know what’s going on with IUBB, especially around tournament time. You don’t have to live and breathe IUBB like a bunch of people around you, but it wouldn’t hurt to know about the team to an extent as to not offend virtually everyone else around you.

&nbsp;

**FOOTBALL**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of horror stories about IUFB. But really, they’re on the rise.  They’ve won a few games in recent years, and during those times, the environment can *almost* be as electric as it is in Assembly Hall.  Memorial Stadium is another great experience that you really shouldn’t miss out on.  Student Season tickets are only $30, and they’re paired with basketball if you opt for those.  For me, it’s worth the cost.

**Tailgating** – a lot of the reason people even make it out to the field on gameday (other than the fact that it’s Big 10 football and is legitimate college football), is for the tailgating.  
Police have started to crack down more on tailgating.  There are a few new rules in place (No open bottles, etc) that are calming it down.

A few things to note:

-	Most of the rules in the Welcome Week post [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/2ac3mv/the_freshmans_guide_to_iu_welcome_week/) apply to tailgating as well.  If you’re not 21, proceed with **extra** caution if you choose to migrate through the tailgate fields while consuming alcohol.
-	Tailgating starts really early. If you want to get a vehicle in the fields, you’re going to have to wake your ass up early. And I mean *early*.
-	Don’t be afraid to actually come in and watch the game.  Support the team.  Support the only reason that you actually have an excuse to be drinking at 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday.

**OTHER SPORTS**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what? Football and basketball are not the only sports that are played at IU, **in fact**, the other sports have been *more* successful lately.

**Baseball** - Tracy Smith helped put IU Baseball on the MAP. Last year, the Hoosiers’ Baseball team reached its first College World Series.  This year, they had an outstanding season and hosted a Regional.  With the departure of Tracy Smith, they have hired a new coach – Chris Lemonis – who has had outstanding success recruiting good ball players and winning baseball games at Louisville over the last 12 years.  IU Baseball is here in a good way, and have had much more success than IUBB and IUFB over the past couple years.

**Soccer** - 8 National Titles. 8 Stars.  The soccer team has historically had more success than any of the Hoosier athletic programs. Their most recent national title came in 2012. The soccer matches are fun. Make your way out there.

**Swimming & Diving** - Perhaps you’ve heard the name “Mark Spitz” before? The Olympic medal record holder for 30+ years before Michael Phelps came along. Where did he swim in college? You guessed it – Indiana. This program is always good.

**Others** - The truth is, **none** of the IU athletic programs are *bad* in any sense of the word. Sure, they might suffer defeat, but that’s mainly because they’re in one of the best, if not *the* best conference in the country when it comes to college sports.  If you have a place in your heart for any particular sport, come watch IU.

&nbsp;

##CLUBS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, guess what? Athletics aren’t for everyone. We totally understand that here in Bloomington, that’s why we have a community for people that are into everything. Seriously, there’s a club for just about [everything]( https://myinvolvement.indiana.edu/sissastd-prd/p/organization.do?methodToCall=orgSearch#p)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you aren’t into something, but would *like* to be, that’s what these clubs are all about.  Want to learn Karate? [You’ve got it](http://www.indiana.edu/~karate/).  Thinking you’d like to know how to Swing Dance? [Done.](http://www.indiana.edu/~iuswing/)
The plethora of options available to people with tastes in just about everything is purely astounding, and most would consider you a fool for not taking advantage.

&nbsp;

##OFF-CAMPUS ACTIVITIES

**Lake Monroe** - Perhaps one of the hot-pots (especially during the spring season), Lake Monroe is one of the largest lakes in Indiana.  Boat rental is a common thing, and it’s a nice place to enjoy summer-like activities.  Everything that goes on at most major lakes around the country can be found going on at IU.

**[The Quarry](http://www.bloomingpedia.org/wiki/Rooftop_Quarry)** - Hiking, cliff jumping, and other activities are all options around here.  And important note is that most of it is on private property, and by going here you are indeed trespassing. Beware of the dangers associated with trespassing and cliff jumping.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other different venues that are available that feature physical activities (like rock climbing, bowling) as well as visual entertainment (art galleries, movie theaters), and they are plentiful in Bloomington.

&nbsp;

##SHOPPING
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a variety of different types of shopping locations when it comes to Bloomington.  Music (in old formats and new) is certainly not lacking by any means, and there are multiple stores across the downtown area that can fulfill all your needs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to clothes, there is indeed a mall – College Mall.  While this mall isn’t particularly popular, and tends to be flooded with high schoolers, they have opened up a couple stores recently (including an H&M), where good clothes can be found at a relatively cheap price.
There are also multiple shopping boutiques downtown for those with a little more expensive taste.
Most major franchises – Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, Best Buy, Michaels, and others have a place in Bloomington.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are multiple thrift shops in town, and some really neat, exotic things can be picked up for some really good prices. I would recommend trying to peruse one or two of these in your free time.
As with everything in Bloomington, word of mouth and simply touring the town can open your eyes to a whole lot of different options for stores. 

**It is important not to forget that there are a lot of businesses (well-known and unique) that are on the west side of 37.**

If you live off campus, like me, you can still come in through the veranda till midnight. And I bet some of the awesome residents will help you if you may need to go out for a smoke once in a while (again, like me).

There will be yarn, needles, amd hooks provided, along with free snacks. If you don't know how to knit or crochet, there will be people there who can teach you (myself included on the crochet side).

TL;DR: knit-a-thon tomorrow at Collins for a great cause. You can learn a new skill and work for the greater good at the same time!",2jgpdr,IndianaUniversity
SSL VPN issues with OS X Yosemite?,4,1,"Have any fellow Mac users had issues using SSL VPN clients on Yosemite? I'm currently trying to use Network Connect client (off campus) and I keep getting a connection error. I'm also trying to log into IUware to download the new Juniper Pulse client, but I can't even load the site from any browser.

"Help requested, finding an IU-centric song",14,3,"About 10 years ago, there was a song/video titled ""IU We're All for You"". It chronicled the (probably-embellished) story of a guy's decision to go to IU, and his experiences in Bloomington, with a lot of name-dropping of places on campus and around town.

I used to pull up the video from time to time when I was feeling nostalgic (I graduated around the time the song was released), but it looks like it has been deleted off of YouTube, and a quick Googling of the lyrics doesn't bring up any results. I can't remember the name of the artist, either.

Does anyone else remember this song, and do you have any idea of how I could listen to it again?

Thanks!

Skiing at Paoli Peaks,2,4,"We (2 skiers-IUB students, 1 snowboarder-IUB Student Dad) go to Paoli Peaks a lot (everyone has season's passes) and have an empty seat in the car. We're looking for other skier/skiers to fill that seat.

What's a typical outing like? Everyone gets together around 1600 just south of campus, we drive to Paoli Peaks picking up food at the Lost River market in Paoli. Ski the peaks until close and return home.

Things to know:

1) You're a proficient skier (greens, blues, blacks, on piste, off piste).  We're not looking to teach people to ski.  :-)

2) You have to pay your own way.

3) You have your own equipment (equipment at your mom's house in New Hampshire doesn't count)

4) You're about the skiing... après-ski isn't what we're about...

5) We have a lot of fun skiing, seriously... a lot.

Career Fair Advice from an IU alumni/recruiter,24,3,"Note: I'm leaving out which company I'll be representing so this doesn't break the subreddit rules of advertising, also it gives me freedom to be more honest about the process.

I graduated in 2013 with an Informatics major and will be back on campus for the **Arts & Sciences Career Fair** Tuesday and **Informatics and Computer Science Career Fair** Thursday. I've made a list of what helped me during my career fair experiences as well as what I've gathered from going full circle to recruit from IU. Hope it helps!

* Career Fair:
 * Your school career fair website should list all the companies and whether they're hiring interns, full time, or both. Skip talking to companies not offering what you want unless you have extra time and want to talk to them for the future. Make a list of your favorite companies and talk to them first.
 * The most popular companies will have long lines, come early to avoid them!
 * In my experience it works best to introduce yourself and hand them your resume, them say what you're looking for e.g. full time position. Some majors are funneled into certain positions and you opening with your skill set helps the recruiter tell you if you should talk to someone else at the booth instead. The recruiter will then guide you with questions to see if you meet the minimum requirements like GPA or a work visa, and maybe ask questions like why you're interested in that company, what relevant experience you have, etc.
 * Don't make the mistake I did at first with a minute long elevator pitch about yourself. They won't remember most of it and can read your resume to get the same details. Exception - super relevant experience like applying for a consulting job when your whole family and best friend are consultants.
 * Absolutely ask questions if you want, but the super specific questions are best left to the actual interview/on site visit. Unless you're talking to the recruiter, I'm not going to be able to tell you the exact specific details of a job I haven't had besides the general information and requirements. Your first round interview and beyond are where to ask those questions, the career fair is just getting your foot in the door and considered for an interview.
 * Confirm how to apply - is giving them your resume enough? is there an online app you have to do?
 * When you leave shake their hand, smile and say thanks! If someone is very promising and then walks off with out saying goodbye that could mark them down.

* Resume:
 * Bring many paper copies, better save than sorry and paper costs a few cents a sheet
 * Spelling, grammar, formatting count! Not that I'm reading every line, just the overall experience, but if your margins are off or I see spelling mistakes that's a mark against you.
 * Get some nice paper to print them on for bonus points
 * Try to fit it on 1 page if you can

* Dress:
 * Any way you go above the minimum helps you stand out e.g. wearing a suite jacket instead of just dress pants and a dress shirt
 * General hygiene - shower, trim your nails, brush your teeth before coming, deodorant, no excessive cologne/perfume (some is ok)

* Don'ts:
 * Wear bad clothes - wrinkled, untucked, holes in it, etc. we *will* remember that and factor that into an interview offer
 * Bad hygiene
 * Argue with the recruiter - e.g. if the company doesn't hire above X GPA, the people there are not who set or change that

* What I look for:
 * Good social skills! Someone with little experience and a barely passing GPA but great social skills could be weighed as much as a 4.0 grad student who can't communicate well
 * Be respectful of our time and don't spend more than a few minutes at the booth if there's a line, we talk to hundreds of people sometimes!
 * Be yourself! Acting fake or like who you think we want you to be is obvious
 * If you meet the requirements for our hiring and seem like a decent person I'm almost always going to pass you to the main recruiter who decides first round interview offers.

Remember that some people at the booth are full time recruiters, others are regular employees, and others may be managers/HR/upper management. Some companies may have 1 recruiter make all the interview offer decisions and others may let anyone who is manning the booth pass people. Regardless treat everyone with respect and be friendly!

I can try to answer general questions here, or PM me if you don't want to post. Good luck to everyone!",5pt0dn,IndianaUniversity
Career Services as a former student,8,0,"Do I have access to any career services as a former soic student who transferred back home to IU Northwest in good academic standing?

Good housing for a grad student with a kid? (x-post with /r/bloomington),3,3,"Hi! I'm going to be moving to Bloomington this summer for my MA. I'm a middle-aged male with a three-year-old boy... and without a car. I'm hoping people could offer some pointers for finding housing that isn't prohibitively horrible/inconvenient/expensive.

Potential issues:

* I have a bike seat for the kid, but obviously need a place that's a walkable distance either from campus or from a dependable bus route (i.e. one that doesn't stop running at 6pm, on weekends, or when school is out).

* I have my own furniture and hundreds of books. In some ways this is awesome, but it could create a problem when it comes to moving into a small apartment or a shared/communal residence or the like.

* I'm a little picky about some things, but I have a tight budget. Electric bills that shoot up to $200 in the winter are a turn-off, as are places that allow smoking... or anything else that I'd want to protect my son from. I don't want to settle for something crappy, but I also can't afford to spend a thousand or more each month on rent alone.

I've done some searching and so far the most likely-looking option is Park Doral. But any insight, feedback, or advice people could offer would be awesome. Thanks!",6di68o,IndianaUniversity
"ATT wifi going away; ChromeOS, Linux and (certain) Android devices still unable to connect to IU Secure",24,29,"Former UITS employee here. Word on the street is that the ATT wifi is ""very likely"" going to be turned off in dorms and academic buildings because too many students are using it and not IU Secure. Fair enough, I suppose, but that leaves ChromeOS, Linux and (some) Android users out in the cold. UITS is aware that Linux, et al. users cannot connect to IU Secure, but hasn't been convinced to divert resources to fix the issue.

While ChromeOS/Linux/etc represent probably something around only 5% of IU's user base, this does mean that Chromebooks, the hands-down cheapest solution to a workable student laptop, will be stifled on campus. Our least affluent students will be hurt the most. (ChromeOS is a type of Linux, fixing the ChromeOS problem will likely solve the others, too.)

Please take to social media and tweet / post at IU's official pages **POLITELY** expressing your concern over the issue: either fix IU Secure or provide an alternative means for ChromeOS/Linux to connect to the internet in dorms and academic buildings. 

The way that UITS is structured is that organizational concerns voiced on social media actually get more attention than simply calling the UITS Support Center. (Think about it, who's better to fix a design flaw in your car: the mechanic or the manufacturer?)

A few simple college questions from a junior in high school.,7,9,"Hey guys,
I'm just starting to look at colleges and IU's one of the schools I'm looking at

I've got two main questions that I can't seem to find a solid answer to.

First off, the tuition at this school is really high. I live in Illinois so for me to attend would be over 45k... Most similar schools are significantly cheaper. Is there any way to bring the price down?
I'd like to apply, but my budget is around 35k. If it helps, I have a 3.5 GPA and a 29 ACT, several AP and Honors courses, and come from a low income single parent home.

Also, I'm a little confused about the Kelley school of business (this is really a general question about majoring in Business). I'd like to major in Business or Finance or something money related. For me to get into IU isn't a problem- With my grades and scores I can get in.
However, I don't think my grades are good enough to get into the Business program...
How does that work? Can I get accepted into IU but denied from the business school and be forced to change majors? Or can I major in business in the general campus and then have the option to go to the Kelley school? Or is it that I can major and get a bachelors in business from IU but then can go to Kelley for my masters?

I know almost nothing about how the college process works other than the reviews and statistics I read online so forgive me for the simple questions(:

The Freshman's Guide to IU: Welcome Week,32,11,"This post will hopefully be one of a few that serves as an updated guide (published summer 2014) for incoming IU freshmen.  
	
I do appreciate feedback, and I will make changes/corrections and additions to this post in the comments as you provide them. Credit to the deleted account that put together the original guide [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/j96m5/freshman_welcome_week/) on which this is loosely based.

I hope to encompass everything I can, and to be as helpful as I can to you new Hoosiers! 

&nbsp;

**WELCOME WEEK!!**

&nbsp;

-MOVING IN-

1.	You’re going to forget things at home in the packing process, that’s just how it works. But guess what? That’s okay! One, because you’ll have plenty of weekends to go home and get whatever it is you need (There’s a 3-day weekend for Labor Day very quickly after school starts), and two, because you’ll be able to buy it if it’s an immediate need at any local store, or at Midnight Madness at Wal-Mart. As far as the first week or so goes, your keys, your phone, your wallet, and your backpack are really the only things that you’ll need.

2.	Moving in a day or two early is an acceptable thing to do to avoid the move-in day chaos, but it isn’t *necessary*. I moved in on the same day as everyone else, and while it’s hectic, it isn’t the worst experience, and it’s very bearable. Plus, you’ll be feeling the exact same feelings that everyone panicking around you is also feeling.

3.	Construction in Bloomington is a very common thing, especially road construction. In fact, it’s very rare to NOT see road construction going on somewhere at any given point in the year.  ~~Currently, the northbound lane of FEE LN. between 10th and LAW LN. is closed for construction on Kelley~~ Fee LN is [open for traffic](http://www.reddit.com/r/bloomington/comments/2az8x5/fee_lane_open_for_northboundsouthbound_traffic/) - be very appreciative of this - it will mean that the A Bus route will go back to normal and confuse a lot of the sophomores/juniors that don't know the real route. They said this construction should be complete by the start of the fall semester, but you know how road construction goes. This is the only major impediment to traffic on campus at the moment.

4.	If you live in Wright/Teter/Ashton/Collins (the older dorms), there are NOT elevators, so dollies can be handy if you have particularly large furniture that is hard to carry.

5.	There is NO RUSH. You’re going to have a whole week of no classes to do things. You don’t need to worry about the heavy traffic, or the amount of time it’s taking you to move in. However, arriving early on your first day is not a bad idea, just to be safe.

6.	**THANK YOUR PARENTS**.  You might want to push them away as soon as you get your last item in the door, but don’t. Your parents likely played the biggest role possible in you being where you are right now. They also might even be paying for it. You need to thank them for everything they’ve done leading up to this point, and make sure they know how much they mean to you. 
They’re likely going to cry their eyes out the moment they get in the car to leave you, so there’s no sense in making them feel unwanted as well.
Follow this up by periodically calling them. You don’t have to call them every day, but at least give them a call at the end of the first week to let them know how things are going, and from there it’s up to you.

&nbsp;

**“I’m moved in, so now what?”**

&nbsp;

I hate to have to say this, but please stay off your computer/phone this week unless it's for networking purposes. IU does have incredible resources when it comes to technology, but now is not the time to use those.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GO *EVERYWHERE*. MEET *EVERYONE*. Seriously.

&nbsp;

Contacts are very important, and the more you have, the happier you’ll be, and the less bored you’ll be throughout your college career.

This can’t be emphasized enough.  You’re going to regret the awkward conversations in passing with your floor mates throughout the year because you didn’t take the time to introduce yourself and be friendly with them when you moved in.  It’s much easier to say “Hey, I’m Dave, what’s up?” during the week where EVERYONE is new, rather than halfway through the year.

If your dorm/house/floor has events, go to them. Make sure you meet as many people as you can. As in life, if you’re friendly to someone, they’ll likely be friendly right back.

If you’re great friends with someone already, now would be the time to explore every part of campus.  Bring a map with you if you need to. Print out a sheet of your classes, and figure out exactly where every one of them is, BUT DON’T STOP THERE!! Go with your friends to their classes. Learning building names and where various locations on campus are is going to be very handy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS PLACE IS SO DIVERSE.

&nbsp;

You are going to meet so many people from so many different walks of life. Rich folks from private academies, country folk, GLBT (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender) people, people from all over the world, people from all over the country.  If you have any prejudices at all, you best rid yourself of them right now. And if you can’t, IU is not the place for you, because you’re going to be dealing with all kinds of people for the next 4 years.

But that’s what makes it so awesome.  There is SO MUCH to be learned from people that come from different parts of the world.  They do things differently, and it’s really neat to learn out how.  Every single person you meet knows something you don’t, and can grant you with that knowledge.  Talk to them.  Learn.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DITCH THE LANYARD.

&nbsp;

Unless you want to immediately be identified as a Freshman. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being a freshman, and they’re as welcome as anyone else.  But if you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb, best get rid of it.  However, you should save it. It’ll be good for a laugh when you find it somewhere later on in your career.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERIOUSLY, GO TO ALL OF THE EVENTS.

&nbsp;

There is so much to learn about the campus and the town, and all of the official events that are planned in the booklets you receive are going to be very informative.  Not only that, but they’re a great place to meet people.

And last, but not least…

&nbsp;

***PARTYING***

&nbsp;

Remember when I emphasized how important meeting people was? This is a big reason why. The more contacts you have, the more likely you are to have a party to go to in the future, or have someone to invite to yours.  Being formally invited to a party is much better than stumbling around in an unknown part of town looking for a house to creep on into.

&nbsp;

Onto partying tips:

1.	**Be Smart**. Last year there was a record number of arrests during welcome week (500+), even more than Little 5 week (which is more notorious for being the “Big Party Week”).  This can mainly be attributed to rookie freshmen that didn’t have any idea of how drinking/police work.  If you’re new to drinking, pace yourself.  Avoid mixing alcohols, especially if it comes out of a large cooler and/or has been labeled as “Jungle Juice” by someone.

2.	**Travel in Groups**. But not TOO large.  Nobody wants to invite a group of 35 freshmen into their house.  Anywhere from 2-7 people is acceptable.  Guys, try not to travel in a group of any more than 3 if you don’t have any ladies with you.  Ladies, never travel alone.

3.	**Don’t freak out when cops show up**. Panicking and running is the only way to make things worse.  Bloomington has a VERY good system for minors that get caught drinking.  In most cases, it ends with a $500 loss for you, but nothing permanent on your record.  Don’t think about killing yourself or dropping out of college just because you got written up for minor consumption, it happens to a LOT of people, and they turn out just fine.

4.	**Guys – Get consent**. Consent is sexy. The only thing worse than an arrest for something alcohol-related that you could get this week is a charge for rape. The law states that someone can't technically give consent if they are under the influence. So if you intend on having sex with someone, you make absolutely sure that they are coherent enough to make the right decision. In some cases, girls will regret the decisions they made and attribute the fact that it happened to alcohol - which is considered rape. No matter what form of rape or sexual assault it is, it is something that you **do not** want to be associated with. **Be. Smart.**

5.	**Frat Parties**. Honestly, Welcome Week isn’t a good time to head to frats since Rush Week is just a week or two away, and cops are also up in that area as well. But if you do: Guys - be respectable.  Don’t insult brothers or break anything.  It’s the quickest way to get the shit kicked out of you and get thrown out of the house. Ladies – learn the reputation of the members of the house you are going to. “Rufilin floats around that place like mosquitos on a mid-summer Louisiana swamp” isn’t necessarily something you want to hear.

*Protips for not getting arrested*:

-	Don’t use a fake I.D. during welcome week, or really ever, UNLESS it’s a REAL I.D. of someone that looks VERY close to you (e.g. your older brother/sister).  Also if you have a fake, make sure you have ANOTHER form of I.D. with that (e.g. that same person’s student I.D.). They will ask for two forms of I.D. at virtually every bar/store.
-	Vodka is the easiest alcohol to conceal, as it can be placed inside water bottles and various other containers.  Cans of beer are NOT easy to conceal, and they can make a lot of noise too.
-	There is a place called “Stadium Crossing” that’s directly west of Memorial Stadium.  This was formerly named “Varsity Villas” and is what people are referring to when they say “the Villas.”  It is a police hotspot during Welcome/Lil 5 week, so be extra careful in those areas.
-	Do not drink in the dorms and get rowdy.  If you want to pregame with a couple people and aren’t going to get loud, that’s okay, but don’t give the R.A. any reason to come knocking.
-	If someone is buying alcohol for you, DO NOT go with them.  Give them money, and have them come inside your dorm room to hand it off.  Excise police are getting better and better about nailing people about this. Not only do you get written up as a minor, but your older buddy gets written up for providing. 
-	You agreed to the dorm’s rules and policies when you moved in. This is not your house or your own private domicile. The R.A. and the campus police can enter your dorm room and search it *ANY* time for *ANY* reason.

&nbsp;

That wraps up this guide.  Again, if you have suggestions/corrections to make, please provide them in the comments, and I’ll make edits as necessary. (I am approaching the character limit, so that may be an issue, however)

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and myself or other community members will gladly answer. If you have a more personal question (relating to being a freshman), feel free to PM me.

Transferring?,4,8,"Hi, I picked the college of my dreams. But, I wasn't selective enough. I didn't know what I wanted out of a college. I don't know whether I should transfer or not. I have been researching online about good reasons to transfer and transfer admissions at my prospective college. I have talked to my dad about it but he became upset.

Reasons I want to transfer to IUPUI:

 1) Unhappy - My emotions constantly revolve between ""Ok, I can do this"" and ""Oh my god, I can't do this."" I feel a lot of pressure and worry about grades. It's not that I was a straight A student in high school so I'm not one of those incoming freshmen who expect high grades without work and effort. But, I feel a lot of pressure to do well here and that is eclipsing my original intent: to learn for the sake of learning.

 2) Not enjoying anything here - It is tough for me to find people to talk to and find clubs to join to keep my mind busy and off of these sort of things. The surrounding city of my college is dull as well - it is a party school. My personal choice is to not drink and involve myself in those situations.

 3) Better environment feeling at the prospective college - it is urban and has better transportation to areas (I can walk anywhere). It also has volunteer opportunities at hospitals - which is what I want to do.

 4) Closer to home - I am about 2 hours away from home but it is more convenient to plan when I'm coming home if I am closer to home.

 5) Automatically accepted to transfer college - also possibility of getting scholarship that would pay for all costs plus grant me research opportunity -> if I get this, I will transfer. Research ops here are highly taxing and sought after.

6) I want smaller classes - I know that early classes will have bigger lectures but at the transfer college, class sizes are lower. There are, overall, a lot less people on campus anyways because it is a commuter campus. Perhaps it will make it harder for me to find people to talk to but I have friends attending college there so I already have a support group of sorts.

7) Feel isolated - I try to call/text home whenever I can but it seems like family does not want to keep in touch with me. I live in a single as well - no roommate - and floor mates are all antisocial.

8) Better support system for my majors - more connected campus feeling/ better clubs that I am actually interested in at the transfer campus


Basically, I am unhappy here and I think I could be happier at the transfer college. I am going to give myself the whole year here and see how it goes next semester. I just do not know how to break this to my parents because they will be really disappointed in me if I don't have the right reasons. Transferring gives me hope because I feel strong anxiety when I am worried about grades here. I do not want to focus on that. In high school, I wanted to go to college to learn. Now, this place I am at has changed me and caused me to become someone I do not want to become. Let me know if I should transfer or not - or if my reasoning is sound/logical.

I also am looking into premedical studies - which I know are equivalent here and at IUPUI. I want to join clubs that are offered at IUPUI and not IU such as the slam poetry team, history of medicine club, and philosophy club. I want to volunteer at the hospitals found in Indy - Riley, Eskenazi, etc. How is the atmosphere at IUPUI? Do you think that IUPUI has what I'm looking for, in your opinion?

Masters in Data Science questions - prospective applicant,3,1,"I am a senior in computer science at IUSB who spent my first 2 years at Bloomington campus before taking a year off then transferring to IUSB to save money on tuition. 

I have some research projects and 2 decent internships, data science/viz and machine learning have been interests of mine for several years so I consider myself fairly knowledgeable for an undergrad. Python, R and related ML & scientific computing libraries (tensorflow, numpy/pandas, matplotlib, sklearn  etc.) I've worked with Karst and other similar resources for ML purposes such as AWS EC2 instances. 

With this masters I'm trying to improve my resume a bit and ideally go into something directly data science related instead of general software engineering. But if it just helps me get a higher paying job somewhere nice through IU career services that's also a perfectly acceptable outcome to me. 

So my main question is how competitive is admissions to the program? Should I try to go for the online program? Or half and half online/on-campus option? Get myself an extra year or 2 of job experience? What's the typical accepted student profile? The soic website is uncharacteristically lacking in general info. 

My cumulative GPA is a 3.1 something and I have no true work experience in the field. I have taken a couple practice GREs and gotten in the top 20th percentile range.

Future IU construction plans,11,13,"So I pulled an all-nighter last night because I needed to see a friend off at his shuttle at 6:50 AM.  The shuttle took off from the Union so we were wandering around inside for a while.  I decided to take a look at the campus architectural model by the elevators for the hotel (you should all know what the hell I'm talking about) and discovered something kind of ridiculous.

Turns out IU has plans to extend Law Ln (north side of train tracks) to the part of 10th street that just crosses from the south side to the north side of the tracks.  If you know the area I'm talking about, then you should know that this sounds like a really stupid idea.  To come out at Law Ln onto 10th street would mean that you're trying to merge with a complete blind spot to your right.  The best thing you could do is add a stop light which would increase congestion on 10th street to ludicrous proportions.

The second piece of future construction I noticed was pushing Woodlawn further north, through the train tracks, and meeting at the bypass.  This I don't have as big of an issue with except for the fact that to do this, they'd effectively be splitting Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium.  I don't know about you guys, but I feel like there's just something incredibly wrong with that.

Downvote if you wish, but I thought this is something all of us need to know, and maybe even discuss about bringing to the administration.

tl;dr: More road construction meaning more congestion, and the splitting of two of our most iconic teams (maybe one of those teams is iconic for the wrong reason, but whatever it's still the idea).",12lsms,IndianaUniversity
Major Cell Upgrade on Campus,14,13,"Will become active in August.  Will ""guarantee"" full strength coverage on 95% on campus.  Will be carrier agnostic.

Memorial Stadium is to be wired for a maximum capacity of 55k users.

This info is breaking via a video conference going on in the CIB at this moment.  Will update post if any other pertinent information is given.

EDIT:  Basically what is happening is IU will have it's own cellular infrastructure (think IU Secure), which all the carriers will tie into.  There will be antennas placed everywhere on campus, and inside buildings.  The antennas inside buildings will look like smoke detectors.  The exterior antennas will be camouflaged somewhat.  What tlmasonaea said is true.  Not all carriers will be joining this from the start.  From what they said, Verizon will be the first to start on this system, with AT&T and Sprint to follow.  The reasoning is more budgetary than anything else.

The hope is that since a majority of users have data plans, this will take a significant load off of IU Secure.  The single fact that blew me away from this was that the cell phone companies are making a total of 180 million a year in revenue from users associated with IU.",sombj,IndianaUniversity

THE FALL 2019 RUSH GUIDE,86,17,"Well well well. . . look what you have stumbled upon. 

It’s /u/uscrushburnerrsdn with the content all of you naive soon to be rushees have been waiting for. I’ve seen your PM’s to me, I’ve heard your chatter all over /r/USC, and I’m finally delivering, just in time. Yep, it’s my OFFICIAL FALL 2019 FRATERNITY RUSH GUIDE. This will answer all, if not most questions you may have about how to go through fraternity rush at USC this fall. 

Now, after my introduction, let me preface my post by saying this. What makes me qualified to talk about all of this? I have a relevant position at one of the fraternities that I’m going to list later on. No, I’m not telling you which one. I know what doxxing is and I’m not an idiot. I have friends in nearly every single house on the row and I know how rush works after seeing the process from both sides. Why are *you* the one making this post? I’m doing it because I want to teach the people of /r/USC, okay? Rush sucks and if I make things easier for you, you will sure make things easier for me. Win-win situations, everyone goes home happy. Now sit back and appreciate this novel of a post. 

#RUSH. HOW IT WORKS, AND HOW TO DO IT.

Heads up: Freshmen can’t rush for the fall semester. Looks like you’re stuck with Bandito’s and dorm parties for a semester. 

I’m not here to convince you why you should rush, but I will say that going Greek has by far been the best thing for my social and personal life so far at USC. Even if you are not really high on the idea of being in Greek life, you can rush and still not have to commit to being in a house. If you haven’t already, sign up for rush online at www.uscifc.com because it’s not that hard. You won’t be able to rush in the first place unless you have that done. Already registered? Good, next step. 

**Before Rush**

If you know someone in one of the fraternities **well**, then you can go ahead and text them. Give them a heads up. Something subtle. Like, “Hey, just wanted to let you know that I’m rushing and hope to see you at house tours.”. Nothing more. They’ll appreciate it, and they might go ahead and tell some other guys in the house to be on the look out for you. It shows them that you’re interested and it can’t hurt you. 

Remember, nothing more than that. I promise. 

**During Rush**

***Friday, 8/23 - Rush Kickoff:*** It’s a meeting at Bovard followed by a “barbecue”. The meeting at Bovard is a joke. You sit in the auditorium seats and each house introduces themselves with a PowerPoint slide that shows their famous alumni, their events, and maybe one other minute detail about their house. If I remember correctly, they split you into your rush groups here, where you will be for house tours, but they’re not relevant on the kickoff night. The barbecue is merely the rush chairs and a few of the younger bros hanging around a table and some folding chairs in the McCarthy Quad. This is the first time you can make an impression but with a bad ratio between rushees and brothers you need to move around fast and recognize if you’re not getting enough face time with guys at a house. Meet as many guys at as many different houses as you can, because the guys there will have more clout in voting situations. Best case scenario some of them will already recognize you by the time you walk through for house tours. I wouldn’t say that the barbecue is really important but if you can meet some people there who will take you under their wing through house tours and maybe the rest of rush, that’s great. 

***Saturday, 8/24 - House Tours Day 1:*** Alright, this is where rush gets serious. This is the actual “rush” part of the process. The groups that you got split into at the rush kickoff come into play now. You’ll be told where to meet up with your groups and you have to be with them all day long. You will only go to half of the fraternity houses on day 1. It’s a very long process and it sucks for both rushees and all of the current brothers but it’s a better system than how rush used to be. 

If they’re doing it the same as last year, you’ll have exactly 30 minutes at each house. IFC is really strict with it so you have to be smart with your time. Each house will shuffle you in and split you off immediately to go and do an official house tour. It’s just to show you around. You’ll see a few bedrooms, the gym, the party space, and maybe the chapter room or some other random spots that said house takes pride in. That should take no more than 5-10 minutes. After the house tour though, it’s on. All of the brothers will be in one area and you have to go and talk to as many of them as you can while still making an impression. 95% of the time, you have to personally walk up to them and introduce yourself, while they will engage you in the conversation and keep the questions flowing. Once you feel like you’ve had a good intro conversation with someone and then talked about one random, memorable thing (that still ties into the conversation), just tell them that you have to keep moving around, they’ll understand, and you have to move to the next person. 

Understand this part though. With the new (as of last semester) rush system, every single rushee has to go to every single house, regardless of wether they want to or not. If the house you’re going through has common sense, they will split up rushees immediately into who they like and who they do not like. You have to be self aware enough to understand that you might end up at a house where they’re just not interested in you and you’ve got to accept that. Pick up their signals and it you will both be better off. If they like you: odds are you’ll get shuffled through and you will meet a lot of important brothers or just large numbers of them. All of the rush chairs, maybe the President, some other bros will be told to meet you as opposed to you walking up to them. If they don’t like you: odds are you will be moved to corners of the areas where everyone is talking to get set up with some people who will eat away your time, or brothers just will not have any desire to talk to you. They might even walk away when another brother tells them to go and meet someone else. This is just the harsh reality of rush and the faster you accept it, the better, because then you won’t waste your time there on your 3rd day of house tours. You’ll know if they are interested or if they are not interested if you can pick up on simple context clues. 

These house tours days are really long and grueling. You will be tired, and so will the brothers. They will talk to a ton of rushees. Do what you can to stand out and your name and face will probably be well received when the chapter does voting later that night. Also, be yourself. If you try to play a part or pretend you’re someone that you truly are not, everyone will see right through you. It’s so obvious. 

***Sunday, 8/25 - House Tours Day 2:*** It’s exactly the same routine as House Tours Day 1 but this time, you go with your same groups and tour the other half of the houses on the row. 

***Monday, 8/26 - House Tours Day 3:*** House tours on the 3rd day are slightly different because you get to break off from your groups and go to houses on your own. I want to say houses can make cuts before day 3 of house tours so there may be some houses that you aren’t allowed to go back to. To be honest I don’t totally remember how we did it last semester but we may have made cuts before the open house tours day. Obviously, if you’re cut from a house and they don’t show up on your online rush portal, then you’re not allowed back. It’s pretty self explanatory but my only advice here is to go back to the houses where you think you have a shot, and split up your time between 2+ houses. Try to talk to people who you haven’t talked to and maybe say hi to other guys who you had good conversations with. Not that hard. 

***Tuesday 8/27 and Wednesday 8/28 - Off Campus Events Days 1 and 2:*** These are like house tours all over again, but they’re more extended, limited to one house per night, and they’re at a venue. Most houses will have you take a bus to a site in the LA area. Typically, they have dinner catered and venues will be something like “bowling alley”, “mansion night”, “batting cages”, or “cigar night”. Same thing as house tours, just try to meet as many guys as you can. It will sound cliche by the end of rush but it’s really the best advice you can follow. Try to split up your off campus events between 2 houses if you can, but you can very easily take your chances by pushing all in on one house. Or “suiciding” as they call it. It’s called that for a reason because it’s significantly more risky but you can still get a bid if you’re really confident in said house. The only reason why I say split it up is because the luxury of going into Blue Chip Dinner with 2 or more invites is a good spot to be in. A majority of the houses (I know of at least one that doesn’t) will be making cuts after either one or both nights of the off campus events. 

***Thursday, 8/29 - Blue Chip Dinner:*** Also known as just “Blue Chip” to most, it’s more selective than the prior events. You can only pick one house’s Blue Chip invite. It’s a formal dinner somewhere in LA where you dress up in a suit and go to dinner with the a ton of the brothers and the rushees. Each house has their own deal with Blue Chip, and usually you will see tons of brothers who you have never seen before. Some houses might mess with you and ask really weird questions to see how you will react to it, and others might be really chill and have it be more like house tours or the off campus events where they just want to talk to you on a personal level. A lot goes on at Blue Chip but my only tip for you is: don’t be an idiot, and you’ll see yourself getting a bid. 

***Friday, 8/30 - Bid Night:*** Every house does it differently. Have fun with it. If you got a bid, congrats, if you didn’t, it’s not the end of the road for you. 

**After Rush**

If you didn’t get a bid during rush, there is secondary rush, which is much more laid back. It’s just a few hours, every house is required to have representatives there, and you can just go to talk to the rush chairs or whoever else is there. If a house likes you, they might offer you a bid on the spot or text you later on letting you know. If you come out of secondary empty handed, then either rush next semester or come to the conclusion that maybe Greek Life isn’t for you.

Obviously there is a lot more to rush behind the scenes, PM me if you’re interested in hearing about it. 

#THE FRATERNITIES

Let’s be honest. This is what you’re probably here for. I’m not going to provide “rankings”, because all those do is provide toxicity to Greek Life at USC. All of you naïve freshmen and transfer students who keep refreshing GreekRank every 15 minutes are just looking at junk from GDIs, other rushees, and some houses that think they can self rank their way to relevance. So, with that being said, *I am listing the IFC fraternities only and I am putting them in Greek alphabetical order.* Get over it nerds, I’m not ranking. I’m just going to tell you what I know about each house and my personal opinions on them.

There are positive things and negative things to say about every house on the row, but all in all, you just have to choose which is right for you. This is just to give you a rundown of what they're like from an unbiased view. 

**ΑΕΠ - Alpha Epsilon Pi -** ***“AEPi”***: I’m 90% sure AEPi is taking over the old Pi Kapp house (742 W 28th St.), which in my opinion is better than their old house that Sammy took over. AEPi’s new house has a decent party space in the backyard and it is set up pretty well on the inside. AEPi was pretty quiet last fall because they got into some trouble (and nearly got kicked off after a long suspension) for “an incident”, if that tells you anything. They’re nationally Jewish and word on the street is that they are looking to take more Jewish kids this semester because nationals wants them to meet a quota. Even though their house is supposed to be Jewish they are maybe 20% Jewish right now. They have above average sorority relations and threw some decent parties come the Spring semester. Hard pledge semester. 

**ΔΤΔ - Delta Tau Delta -** ***“Delt”, “DTD”***: Delt is on the smaller side in terms of membership, but will remind you that their chapter has perhaps one of the most famous fraternity alumni of all time. [Will Ferrell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow_B5Ic8erQ). Their house (833 W 28th St.) and party space is huge but it is owned by a fraternity that is eligible to re-establish their charter and they could be told to leave soon. It feels like a true “Frat House” on the inside too. They haven’t really taken advantage of the resources they have and I can’t say I know much about their pledge semester. They’re not the most social of houses but they’re good guys. That’s all I really can say because I don’t know much about them. 

**ZBT - Zeta Beta Tau -** ***“ZBT”***: ZBT is the 3rd Jewish fraternity, and along with Sammy, it’s more Jewish heavy than AEPi is even though ironically, they're not nationally affiliated with a religion. ZBT is pretty New York and East Coast heavy, but they have a good mix of everyone considering they are one of the biggest fraternities at USC. They easily have 200+ active members. ZBT is in an old sorority house that’s honestly not as impressive as it looks from the outside. They have a good party space out back that is covered up and a pretty good front yard. They had a space themed party like every other house on the row but I couldn’t tell you how well received they were. They have okay sorority relations and a harder than average pledge semester.

**ΚΣ - Kappa Sigma -** ***“Kappa Sig”***: Kappa Sig looks pretty meh from the outside (928 W 28th St.) but they got a ton of alumni money to redo their house and it’s arguably one of the nicer ones on the row now on the inside. They have a big side yard like Sig Nu and a basketball court out back so it's a pretty good sized party space but supposedly they’ve been on suspension from their nationals now for a while because it’s been like at least a year since they have had a party. If they're off of their national suspension now they should have the budget saved for a decent social semester. Their sorority relations are alright but I guess that’s the side effect of not having parties for a while. Kappa Sig is another one of those houses that doesn’t totally have a lot of guys from one specific area, it’s more of a mix. They have an easy pledge semester. 

**ΛΧΑ - Lambda Chi Alpha -** ***“Lambda”, “Lambda Chi”***: Lambda keeps up good sorority relations despite how bad their house and their party space is (720 W 28th St.) because they throw good parties and they have big names in their house. They always are playing basketball out front of their house. I know that they just bought their house which means it’s harder for them to get kicked off. They tend to bid a lot of big money kids and athletes. A lot of people tend to say that Lambda is Bay Area or international heavy. Lambda has a notoriously easy pledge semester and it is general knowledge that their house doesn’t have great brotherhood. 

**ΠΚΑ - Pi Kappa Alpha -** ***“Pike”***: Pike nationally does not have the greatest reputation. USC Pike has historically been the same way but things seem to be changing slowly. They have one of the better houses on the row (642 W 28th St.), but they don’t own it and they will have to move 2 years from now because they only have a 3 year lease on the house. It's got a cool upstairs room with a balcony and their courtyard party space isn't huge but they make it work. As dumb as it sounds, Pike has a ton of guys who are into lifting and EDM but that’s not their only crowd. Their sorority relations are steadily improving, especially after having good parties last semester. As for their pledge semester, it’s relatively hard. 

**ΣΑΜ - Sigma Alpha Mu -** ***“Sammy”***: Sammy is formerly a Jewish fraternity nationally but they technically aren’t anymore. Even though they officially dropped their Jewish affiliation a long time ago, they are kind of known as the more Jewish house along with ZBT. Sammy takes guys that aren’t Jewish, but they still have a large amount of guys who are. They’re pretty nice and their Astroworld party put them on the map but I don’t know how well they will fare with the new house. They just took over the old AEPi house at 904 W 28th St. which I personally think is one of the worse houses on the row. Sammy has also gotten into some hot water recently for some stupid decisions and they were put on suspension last year. They have an average pledge semester. 

**ΣN - Sigma Nu -** ***“Sig Nu”***: Sigma Nu is located at 660 W 28th St. and they have a pretty good house. It looks a bit like an industrial building but they have a sand volleyball court and good party space, plus a roof that can have smaller events. Sigma Nu doesn’t really have one set stereotype like a lot of other houses do. They have guys from everywhere across the nation and they have a really diverse group. Sigma Nu is one of those houses where anyone can find people who they will get along with. In the last few years they have consistently had good parties and have made a name for themselves that way. They have decent sorority relations and a harder than average pledge semester. 

**ΣX - Sigma Chi -** ***“Sigma Chi”***: Sigma Chi is at 907 W 28th St. which is one of the biggest single houses on the row, albeit a bit of a dump. They have a big backyard and party space. They are known as a big house in terms of membership and a majority of their brothers are from Southern California. They have a big Orange County and LA surfer type crowd and they have some athletes but not as many as Lambda Chi. Their “brotherhood” is weak as they have a ton of guys in the house. They have good sorority relations and a pretty easy pledge semester. 

**TKE - Tau Kappa Epsilon -** ***“Teke”***: It’s pronounced “Teke” but I’m writing TKE because who actually writes “Teke”? Anyways, they have 2 houses (625 and 631 W 28th St.) because a big tech guy was an alum from their chapter and he donated a ton of money to the chapter, effectively giving them so much money that they could take over the house next door to them and renovate both of them. Anyone on the row will tell you that TKE has the nicest fraternity house on the row by far. Not to mention they have a massive party space with 2 backyards. One of the downfalls though is that they have well over 200 members, which can hurt brotherhood and force cliques. TKE is very LA-area heavy and they have more African-Americans than any other IFC fraternity. Their sorority relations seem to have tailed off a bit and their parties recently have not been as notable as some of their others. TKE used to be known for a very hard pledge semester but supposedly it’s not what it used to be.

**ΦΔΘ - Phi Delta Theta -** ***“Phi Delt”***: Phi Delt has a huge house (1005 W 28th St.), both physically and in terms of membership. Their backyard is massive and it makes for a good party space. One of their best parties last semester was in the rain but it still had better attendance than plenty of other ones on the row. Being as big as they are, Phi Delt is pretty diverse and has guys from everywhere. They’re also known as the most gay-friendly house on the row but that obviously doesn’t encompass all of them. They don’t have bad sorority relations, but they aren’t as good as they could be. Their pledge semester is about average, maybe slightly harder than average. 

**ΦΚΤ - Phi Kappa Tau -** ***“Phi Tau”***: Phi Tau, like Chi Phi, is very new on campus. They just started last year and I can’t imagine their membership is over 20-30 guys right now. Nothing against them, it’s just that they are too new to really know a ton about them. Don’t quote me on it, but if you take a bid from them I think you can get “Founding Father” status and you can help the chapter grow. They were planning on taking over the old Pike house (700 W 28th St.) but I don’t know if that’s going to be a sure thing going into this year. I can’t imagine they have much of a pledge semester at this point as they’re probably just looking to grow. 

**ΦΣK - Phi Sigma Kappa -** ***“Phi Sig”***: Phi Sig has a pretty impressive house and party space and house on the corner of the row at 938 W 28th St. Admittedly, I don’t know much about the crowd at Phi Sig because I have never really gotten along with any of them all that well. They aren’t as social outside of their own house as most of the other fraternities. Along with Sammy, AEPi, and Pi Kapp (no longer active), they got put on suspension last year and have been working on thin ice since. They had a huge register last semester and that helped their publicity immensely. I‘d say that their pledge semester is average. 

**ΧΦ - Chi Phi -** ***“Chi Phi”***: Chi Phi is relatively new on campus, but they just absorbed the fraternity formerly known as Beta Theta Pi because of some house politic between Beta and their nationals. They are moving into the old Sammy house (707 W 28th St) which I think is a great house with a great party space, and not to mention the roof hangout space that Sammy used. The only downfall with that place was that Sammy couldn’t change anything aesthetically with the house because a fraternity that hasn’t existed at USC for years still owns it. Chi Phi didn’t really have any sorority relations or clout on the row and they only had maybe 30 members, so it’s more like Beta is taking over everything and hiding themselves under the name “Chi Phi”. Beta had parties that were average at best and okay sorority relations. That could all change though because now they’re on the row which was easily the biggest downfall with their last house. Beta was known for having a harder than average pledge semester.

Introverts at USC,16,16,"Hi everyone, 
I was recently accepted to USC as a transfer for computer science. I had been accepted to two others schools prior and was having a difficult time deciding between them since neither felt like the right fit. With the SIR deadline approaching I had to make a choice, but USC's acceptance came. I always felt that it was the best choice for me out of the schools I applied to. However, I also get the feeling that USC is more suited for extroverts, though I do feel like this applies to college in general. I am not interested in partying or greek life at all, and I'm not a very outgoing person either. But I do enjoy being around a small group of close friends. I need to make a decision soon, and I would greatly appreciate any advice from current or former USC students.

Fall 2019 Transfer Advice,4,6,"Hey, I'm transferring to USC as a sophomore for fall 2019.

Also, how dangerous are the neighborhoods around USC? I heard USC is located in a sketchy and dangerous place in LA. Should I be worried for my life if I want to go have fun off campus?

Is USC still a party school?,2,9,"I basically spent my undergrad years grinding at academics and didn't have any fun whatsoever. Fast forward a couple years and I'm at a really stable spot in my career where I can take two years off to go to grad school and not really worry about adverse effects to my career. 

As such, I'm trying to get an MBA at a school that has a strong partying culture. Growing up, USC seemed to embody that but I've read that as USC's academic rankings climb higher, the partying culture has declined accordingly.

Is this still true? What's the party scene like on campus? How much fun are the majority of your peers having? I'm not really interested in what the off-campus/bar scene is like because I could just do that by living and working in LA.",bxcyri,USC

Do grad students tend to live on or off campus? What is the quality of on-campus housing? Is it cheaper or more expensive than the surrounding apartments? 

Degree specific questions:

How long does it normally take to complete a masters degree at USC. I know the standard is two years, but have people at USC done it in less amount of time? Is it fairly common to do a masters degree without a thesis? I noticed some programs don't force a thesis, which surprised me.

Spring Admit Housing - 920 W. 28th St.,1,8,"I'm an incoming spring freshman and got assigned to 920 W. 28th St which was the Delta Chi house before it got shut down.  There's a not a lot of information about the building on the Housing Website, so I had a couple questions for anyone who knows anything about it - 

1) Is it freshman-only housing or is it for all undergraduates? Does anyone know the approximate mix of grades who live there? (Mostly freshman, mostly sophomores, etc.)

2) It's a 15 minute walk to campus and a 20 minute walk to Marshall. Should I bring a bike? How often do you typically go back to your room in a given day? I don't mind walking to and from campus once a day, but if it's more, I'd like to bike. 

3) What's the quality of the housing in that building? Should I apply for reassignment or look for something else? My main issue is with how far away it from campus, especially since I'm a freshman and it's my first semester. 

I was really upset at how far off campus I was assigned and I really don't know anything about this particular house at all so if you or a friend has any info, please help a fellow Trojan out! And if there's anything else, I would really appreciate it too. Thank you so much!

Housing for Fall Semester 2018,3,6,"Hi everyone!
I'm a 3rd year undergrad from India. I'll be researching at a lab at USC during Fall Semester 2018.

I was wondering about what the popular off-campus housing options are. Since it's only a semester-long period, I'll probably have to sublet. I'd also like to know about your experiences. 

For people who are in a similar situation, here is what I have collected so far:

* 1. Leasing for one semester is not feasible. Subleasing is possible.
* 2. Stay within 1 mile of the campus (DPS Patrolled Area)

Does it get better socially?,8,19,"I'm a freshman, and I've done everything in my power to make friends. My first hope was with suitemates. I kind of assumed that suitemates were basically required to be your friend because you live with them. But none of them talk to me. They pull out their phone and ignore me if they walk by met in the hall. Even my roommate only talks to me when he tells me to turn the brightness down on my laptop. I've tried being friendly with them, inviting them to dinner and shit, but I dunno. I feel like they just have something against me, and I don't know why.

So next hope was clubs. I'm in a lot of clubs. LGBT clubs, engineering clubs, esports, etc. And I've met some people from them. But every time I try to hang out with one of the people from the clubs, it's always ""Yeah, I'll text you,"" and then they never do. They'll post stories of them hanging with other people, and stuff like that. And I dunno. I just want them to be honest with me. Like. If you don't wanna be my friend just say. Stop getting my hopes up every weekend only for me to get crushed when I'm spending another Saturday night in my room. 

My last chance was classes. Ironically, I have a decent amount of people that I text from my classes. Not a single one is a freshman, though. Literally all of them are sophomores that live off campus. So like, if I need homework help or just wanna talk, I can text them, but if I actually wanna go get dinner or hang out with them, it's a lot harder. 

Does it get better? Does everyone go through this, or is it just something wrong with me? Like. For fuck's sake, I just want to find my people. I wanna find a group I can chill with on weekends, play games, watch movies, get drunk, IDK. Like. I just want some friends, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. And it really sucks because I feel like I moved out of a small town where everyone knew me and cared about me into a giant area where literally no one cares about me or would think twice if I like disappeared or died or some shit.

Worth it to Go through Reassignment?,2,7,"Hey. I submitted my housing application on May 2 and somehow I got the Century Apartments. Someone on the FB Group said they got the Village and they applied on the 12th. I am miffed to say the least.

However, I still have the option of going through Reassignment. Obviously my chances are low besides maybe getting CarGar. I was thinking of putting down two USC Village, Webb, and CarGar, because frankly those are the only options I will consider. Do many people have success for reassignment? Is Century fine for living? Is CarGar maybe better?

How are the gender neutral housing options (especially for incoming freshmen)?,7,11,"I don't really know if I should have posted this in the freshmen housing thread, but since that was mainly about resident halls, I figured this might deserve it's own post. 

But anyway, I'll be coming to USC in the fall, and I'm still trying to figure housing out. I applied as female, but because my birth sex is male, I ended up in Trojan Hall on an all male floor. At first, I was just like, ""whatever, I'll request reassignment to a dorm with a co-ed floor."" But apparently co-ed floors don't exist at USC, so my only options are to live off-campus in either Cardinal or Century in the gender neutral housing. 
The only problem is that I was really looking forward to having a dorm experience my first year, but if I'm living in an apartment, I'm worried that it's going to be not nearly as social, and that I'll have a hard time making friends, etc. 

Furthermore, does anyone have any experience living in the gender neutral housing? Any transpeople with stories. How are the people there? What are the pros and cons of Cardinal and Century? Would it be necessary for me to apply for the rainbow floor, or is just living in the apartments good enough?

UPDATE: All right, so I e-mailed the guy back, asking him one more time to make sure that coo-ed floors didn't exist. My suspicion that he thought I meant that I wanted to live with a female was  correct. So I've submitted a room transfer application for IRC and PRB as my first two choices, and then, the guy said that if I don't get into one of those, it's basically guaranteed that I get into Cardinal for gender neutral housing. 

The reason I didn't choose Century and the Rainbow Floor is because I'm an incoming freshmen, and everything I've read has said that Century is mainly for upperclassmen, and that I likely wouldn't get in. ",4srbjg,USC
Spring admit Transfer student struggling to make friends,6,9,"Hey guys I was wondering if I could get some suggestions for ways to meet new people, either through upcoming events or just clubs to join. I am living off campus, and just transferred in, so I have been feeling pretty isolated. I figured I would move up in the fall to start making friends and stuff, but without class, I'm not sure where to meet friends. I'm working during the days mostly at some odd jobs to start saving up for tuition.

I'm not weird or antisocial, but it just seems at this point like everyone has already formed friend groups and I can't meet people at parties because I have nobody to invite me to them. I know the obvious answer is join student clubs, but I missed the club fair so it just seems like a daunting task.

Spring Transfer 2018 Housing questions?,2,3,"Hey! So I was accepted for the Spring 2018 semester as a junior transfer, and I'm stressing over housing. I know it's rare for transfer students to get housing, and even more rare for spring students, but I was wondering if there was still a change I could get on-campus housing? For example, if I decided to room with a spring freshman admit (they get guaranteed housing) and we requested each other as roommates, would I most likely be her roommate or would they place her with other freshman? 

For off campus housing, does anybody know anything about the Shrine Apartments? I'm looking at living with three other people, but I don't know anything about the place. Is there anything particularly bad about it? What about the good?

Since I moved in, I have found out my third roommate speaks the same language as them so they never talk in English except if they have to talk to me, some destruction of my kitchen property has occurred (nearly started a fire), they bring people into the rooms without telling me at random hours, had someone staying over without telling me, stay up late and talk and play music when I need to sleep, etc. I feel like it's my job to be the one to leave as all 3 of them are in agreement with their living preferences and I'm the odd one out (majorly). I spoke with my RA about it and he's come back to say that they won't move me out unless I'm in ""immediate physical danger"".

Some Questions for some MIT Graduate Students,7,15,"Hey guys! I was accepted to a Ph.D. program at MIT with the Chemistry department, but I deferred my enrollment to start Fall 2019. As excited as I am to move from IL to MA, I wanted to be prepared for the transition as well as get some of my questions answered about what to expect when I get there while also help me in my move planning.

1. I've read that bringing my car is essentially useless in the Cambridge/Boston area unless I want an excuse to not drink, but I have a motorcycle I will be bringing with me as I will not have any way to store it and have someone reliable take care of it (i.e. ride it and run it occasionally) during my extended time away from home (plus, I don't want to part with it). Is it possible to pay for a parking permit and have it with me near my dorm in a covered lot/garage for several months? If not, is there any storage facilities nearby campus I can keep it at that you know of? 
2. As an incoming graduate student, how easy was applying and getting graduate housing? I recall reading on the webpage that you need to be fully registered, but, as a new grad student, will registration take place before the application closes for housing? Or is there an exception? Or will I be ultimately stuck rushing to get paperwork in next August when I arrive with my belongings to find housing? I am concerned because I will be funding my entire move only through money I am earning at a full-time job, and I would like gauge how much I should aim to save up.
3. I have the understanding it is nearly unheard of to live on-campus at MIT for more than a few years as a graduate student, but is it possible? Renting near campus without roommates is insane compared to my current rent in the suburbs of Chicago (which can be somewhat pricey still). For those of you who transitioned from on- to off-campus, what suggestions would you have to make it easier? Were you more involved in social events your first year and able to find roommates with friends? How did you find a place? How did you find your roommates?
4. I am looking to visit the area before the visiting weekend in March 2019 since I have never been to MA. Is there any places you would suggest I see or go to? It will likely be on a weekend, so I don't expect to see much relating to the MIT facilities.
5. What is something you like about MIT, and what is something you think could be better? Is there anything I should be mentally preparing myself for?

From: Cynthia Barnhart <chancellor-reply@mit.edu>
Subject: Sharing the decision on Senior House
Date: June 12, 2017 at 3:05:32 PM EDT
To: <@mit.edu>

Dear ...,
 
I write on behalf of MIT's senior leadership to inform you of our decision and our plans to support you.
 
The turnaround we launched last June engaged you and a number of faculty, staff, and alumni in work to promote personal wellbeing and academic success in your community. As you know, we received credible and concerning information this past semester and launched a review. A few weeks ago, we informed you of our findings that serious and unsafe behaviors and activities occurred in the house during the turnaround. Unfortunately, these behaviors and activities have served to fundamentally undermine our shared goals for the safety, health, and academic success of all Senior House residents.
 
The senior officers and I have met with many of you to discuss this matter, and we have received and read many emails on this topic. Before making our decision, we carefully listened to and reflected on what we heard. I hope that, through this dialogue, you gained an appreciation for the position we are in given our responsibility to provide all students with safe and healthy residential communities.
 

**Decision & Support**
 
We believe that significant change is needed and have made our decision based on our concern and care for present and future residents of the house. The details of our decision are:

All residents who wish to live in Senior House during the 2017-18 academic year must complete an application to be a member of the community. You will see that we are seeking individuals who are committed to contributing to a residential environment that supports residents' academic and personal development.

Because the process will be very selective, many of you will want or need to make alternative housing arrangements for next year. Please know that we are committed to identifying supportive and welcoming options for every member of your community who wishes to live on campus. You can learn more about the relocation process and indicate your housing preferences here. (Also note that, even if you complete a Senior House application, you still need to fill out the housing preferences form so that you can secure a holding assignment while your application is reviewed).

We will work to find you room assignments in other residence halls as either individuals or as part of small groups of friends. Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson has established a relocation team led by Dean David Randall and Associate Director Jen Hapgood-White to provide guidance and support for you throughout this process. If you have questions about another residential community, moving off-campus, dining, financial aid, work study or any other topic associated with moving, they can help starting today. To reach this team, please email residential-support@mit.edu.


**Moving Forward**
 
In addition to students whose applications are approved and the New House students already scheduled to move in while their building undergoes renovations, a cohort of first-year students will reside in the house next year. We are currently developing a program for first-years focused on the personal wellbeing and academic success principles and goals of the turnaround. The program will feature strong faculty and staff engagement as well as opportunities for peer mentorship.
 
While some of you will be disappointed with our decision, I hope you will understand it is firmly rooted in our care for you as students and our concerns about the health and wellness of your residential environment. The senior officers and I are obligated to protect our students' wellbeing and to require accountability when the facts of a serious situation warrant it.
 
We have also worked to respect your privacy and to keep this matter as confidential as we can. We appreciate that you have done the same, and that you have engaged with us throughout the entirety of this process. With a decision now made, we would like to continue to keep what prompted the review and the review's findings private.
 
Please remember that Dean Randall and Associate Director Hapgood-White are ready to help you right now and can be reached at residential-support@mit.edu. Dean Nelson and I are also here for you if you want to talk about the future at any point over the summer.
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Barnhart

"Thoughts on Pilot 2021, The Institute, et al.",29,25,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think we can agree Pilot 2021 has been a shitshow - administration pointing fingers at ""raunchy"" student behavior, students pointing fingers right back at the ""overbearing"" administration, mailing and news articles blowing up with different rhetorics and angles, all with an undertone of general butthurt. It's chaotic and tiring. I wanted to make sense of what's going on, and possibly shed some light for other students wondering the same thing. I'm speaking to the MIT students, and I hope you can fill in some of the missing details on your own. It's a long post, but you've definitely done worse. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a conflict at the center of Pilot 2021, and inherent to conflict are differing interest groups. It's pretty easy to see what those are: students and administration. There was a dynamic in the past, and that dynamic is now being challenged. Pilot 2021 is a symptom of a challenge to status quo. So who's doing the challenging?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think us students have changed much. Undergrads are undergrads. We want to have fun, we want to explore ourselves and the world around us, we want a world-class education, and to make the most of our young adulthood in general. Undergrads cycle in and out every four year (más o menos, hah). There's never too much variance in that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
More specifically, that is, in the ideology underlying the typical MIT student's mind. There is no pressing issue or cause to our generation. No Vietnam War, no Civil Rights movement, and the ""new tech/social media"" era all in all hasn't done much to change our dynamic with the relevant parties in our sphere. Senior House has always been Senior House. What has changed though, and changed pretty drastically, is the administration.

(This is all very public knowledge, found via Google and summarized [here](http://orgchart.mit.edu/).)

_______________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How does Senior House fit in this picture? The center of everything is Reif's fundraising push. Note that I'm speculating from this point on, but it doesn't take a genius to see why it makes sense. 
__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hockfield had MITEI, the Koch Institude, edX, and Kendall Square under her belt. Her academic background lies primarily in biology. She led the Diversity Leadership Congress, which brought more women and minority scholars to MIT faculty. She has industry ties, but is also on the Board of Trustees for the BSO. Her presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT's history, something like a delta of nearly $3 billion. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reif needs to build a similarly impressive legacy. It's not nefarious; hell it's his job. Some background, Reif is a bit of a ""harder"" character than Hockfield. Reif was an electrical engineering professor. He was Head of EECS in the mid-00's, a position that has close ties with MIT Lincoln Labs, which is a DoD research center and brings in over a quarter of MIT's revenue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reif is leveraging this angle to sell the Campaign for a Better World to industry donors. It aims an eye-watering $5 billion goal, intended to build up the Institution in the name of human progress. Rief moves Grimson, who served as the previous Head of EECS, from his role as *Chancellor*, to a newly minted *Chancellor of Academic Achievement* role. Why? Because they're both of similar career background. They better present a unified front for the campaign. 

The *Chancellor*...
>...has oversight responsibility for graduate and undergraduate education at MIT, student life, student services, and other areas that impact student experience.

While the *Chancellor of Academic Achievement*...

>...engage[s] the Institute with prospective donors—both alumni/alumnae and others unaffiliated with MIT but who share its vision—the majority of the Chancellor[of Academic Achievement]’s time has been spent meeting with such prospective donors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our current Chancellor Barnhart replaces Grimson, circa 2014, with Suzy Nelson as Dean of Student Life to assist. Her role is two-fold. Make sure the student body is aligned to the values of the initiative, as per point six of the campaign, *The MIT Core: Attracting extraordinary students and faculty, and providing them with the resources they need to thrive*, and to **make sure student life isn't an issue for the campaign.** The faces can't present a unified front if the student body doesn't present an ""extraordinary"" image to match. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That brings us to the Healthy Minds survey. Yes, the metadata was supposed to be confidential. Yes, the turnaround process was initiated with its results. I feel the survey was a tool to align the image of student body with the fundraising initiative. It was sold with the aim of improving student life, which was a misleadingly positive take on ""highlighting under-performing areas for future correction"". 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a scene in the movie Syriana that poignantly describes the administration's relationship with Senior House. In Syriana, two US oil companies are attempting a merger, but are under pressure from antitrust regulators from US DoJ. The oil companies hire a D.C. law firm with government ties to convince the DoJ of the merger's ethicality. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lawyer working on this case, Bennett Holiday, is at a barbecue with the CEO of one of the oil companies. The CEO has given one example of malpractice at his company to Holiday, but the DoJ isn't satisfied. They need a bigger fish to fry. But the CEO challenges Holiday, ""You dig a three foot hole and find three bodies, but you might dig a ten foot hole and find forty...""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Holiday is unphased. The DoJ knows the oil companies are corrupt to the bone. The DoJ also wants the merger to go through, it's good for American prosperity. ""Hell, China's economy can't grow as fast as they can because they can't get the oil they need, and I'm damn proud of that fact"". What the DoJ needs, according to Holiday, is to **give the impression of serving due diligence**, and it is implied that they are not serving due diligence itself. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chancellor Barnhart is Bennett Holiday. ""Our students are the brightest on the planet. The student body is inherently aligned to the President's goal of improving research and education. Everyone is on board. *There are no problems here.*""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The survey and turnaround were meant to give the impression of doing due diligence. When an underperforming dorm was found, the administration worked with the dorm to improve it! The real wrench in the machine though, was when someone got caught with guns, bringing an unexpectedly amount of public light to the turnaround, and putting the Senior House name to the forefront of MIT's image. That's a huge no-no. Visibility is everything to a fundraising campaign. The admins pondered what to do, did some more digging, and found some more bodies. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think the administration meant to uncover what they did, but there was no turning back once it happened. If the administration knows what students are up to, and the students know that they know, what can the administration do? They can't just turn a blind eye. That doesn't live up to the students' expectations of them, and also has great potential to **shatter the impression of due diligence.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead, slap the Pilot 2021 bandaid on it. Say that the turnaround's expectations weren't met, direct attention away from exactly went wrong, and instead make a point of emphasizing that more drastic action was taken. Pilot 2021 was an attempt to throw dirt back in the hole before the outside world saw what was in it. 
__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think that's why I felt the administration of recent came off as ""shady"". Their intentions weren't bad: there's nothing wrong at all with Campaign for a Better World's aims. Better the world by improving MIT infrastructure, and enable students and faculty to achieve their greatest potential - I don't think anyone can find fault in that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's just that the process of curating the MIT's image is not something the administration can be 100% honest about. Certainly not to students, to whom the administration must cater to, and **will hold them to a greater ethical standard than even the potential donors.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's why all the talk about ""Pilot 2021 displaces LGBTQ and minority students"", ""unethical survey standards"", or ""punishing a whole dorm for the mistakes of a few"" never made much sense to me. I think it should be obvious that MIT administration isn't ""out for"" Senior House. They're not out for anyone. What happened was that SH became a giant, unavoidable pothole to the aims of Reif's campaign. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nobody created these problems. The administration didn't intend to, and Senior House certainly didn't intend to. And once students started getting more vocal about Pilot 2021, rumors spreading online, more fingers pointed...all in all becoming more *visible* to the general public, the administration really had no other choice but to scrap the poor option for an absolute one. That was the trajectory all parties were on from the beginning, and I honestly don't believe it was planned by anyone. Nobody plans for things to go this awfully, and anyone who might probably wouldn't be sitting on the senior leadership council at MIT. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's really not much that can be done in terms of going back to the way things were. There's no rewind button on this situation. I think this situation speaks volumes for how small, ethically questionable actions (that survey bothers me more than anything else) can create larger problems in the future. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope something positive can come out of all this. SH is all but in ashes (only logistically, certainly not in spirit), but I don't think it means this has to be a total loss. I read talk about creating an alternative living space off-campus...seeing something like that succeed would really be a testament to the vibrancy and individuality of our student body. It'd certainly be a better way to showcasing MIT than this previous attempt. ",6m1ovh,MIT

Having a dog in MechE grad school?,1,3,"Hi! I'm an incoming MIT MechE grad student and I've wanted a dog for a couple years now.

A few more new grad student questions,3,5,"Hi all, looking for some incoming graduate student information that I haven't yet found through google or through my department:

1) Checking out listings on the MIT off campus housing pages requires an MIT ID. When/how is that assigned? 

2) On-campus housing: Is there a way I can estimate my chances of getting in to certain buildings? Are housing assignments completely random? As a first year, should I expect to be assigned to housing with roommates, or is there a chance I can get into a single?

3) Off-campus housing: When do students typically sign leases? If I wait until, say, late July, am I going to have trouble finding an apartment in Cambridge?

4) How is the process of moving in? I've spent some time helping friends move in and out of NYC apartments via UHaul trucks parked 4 blocks away. Is Boston as bad, or is it generally possible to get close to your apartment to unload?

5) When should I plan to move in? Is the week before classes start early enough? Is there a university-wide orientation program for grad students? If so, are those events worth attending? 

6) How is MIT Medical/Dental/Vision coverage? Is it good or just good enough? Does the medical center on-campus cover most typical medical appointments? Do students ever branch off-campus to other doctors for non-specialist care?

7) When is course registration? I know 36 credits is the number thrown around for a full time load; how many classes is that usually?",4fc0tr,MIT

Have any of you ever lived in Eastgate? From the pictures online, the corner apartments look much better than the center apartments. That being said, is the difference significant enough to risk not getting on-campus housing at all.

New steps to enhance mental health and wellness at MIT (For anyone who doesn't get the emails).,24,0,">To the members of the MIT community,
Our community talks frequently and openly about enhancing mental health and wellness here, and about how to best support one another. Today we write to tell you about what we have learned from you, how we are responding, and ways in which you can help.
Through a variety of channels – including conversations and emails, focus groups, and formal proposals – you have told us:
Students would benefit from more counseling and support options;
We should review our withdrawal and readmission policies to ensure that they are fair and supportive; and
We should tap the experience, expertise, and creativity of our whole community to make the MIT community even stronger and healthier.
Last spring, we sent all MIT students the 2015 Healthy Minds Study, a national survey that more than 100 schools have participated in over the years. The findings reinforce what you told us, provide additional instructive guidance, and make clear that MIT is not unique; colleges across the country are confronting similarly complex student health and well-being issues.
For example, 23% of MIT respondents and 32% of national respondents report being diagnosed with one or more mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, a learning disability, or an eating, substance abuse, or attention disorder. (You can view more of the results here and share your thoughts at healthyminds@mit.edu.)
In light of this information, today we are announcing a combination of immediate steps and a long-term, campus-wide initiative. Here is what we are doing, and how you can help:
We are increasing the number of staff who help students in need.
By the end of September, MIT Mental Health and Counseling Service (MH&C) will add two new full-time psychologists; Student Support Services (S3) has already added one new member to its staff and will hire one more this year.

>We are opening a new, centrally located MH&C location for ""Let's Chat"" drop-in consultations. 
Starting September 22, a MH&C clinician will be available to students for informal, confidential 20-minute consultations from 1 to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays in Room 8-316. For more urgent concerns, walk-in hours remain available at MH&C (Building E23, 3rd floor) weekdays from 2 to 4 p.m.
S3 is responding to student feedback by doubling the number of daily walk-in hours and making them a little later in the day. Students can stop by without an appointment every weekday between 10 and 11 a.m. and between 2 and 3 p.m.
Starting September 10, MH&C will offer an online appointment request form on the MIT Medical website. We hope this makes it easier to schedule an appointment.

>To support students who seek counseling off campus, MH&C will identify and share the availability and specialties of local providers who are accepting new patients.
We are increasing the strength of peer counseling in residences and online.
This summer, Student Outreach and Support, in collaboration with MH&C, trained 32 new students to serve as ""Peer Ears."" This more than triples the number of confidential peer-to-peer support providers available in MIT residence halls to help students navigate academic and social life at MIT. The additional trained students will allow the Peer Ears program to expand to Alpha Phi, Burton Connor, East Campus, Kappa Alpha Theta, McCormick Hall, MacGregor House, Maseeh Hall, New House, Next House, Pi Beta Phi, Random Hall, Senior House, and Sigma Kappa. This year, MH&C will launch a web-based portal for students to chat online with trained peers about their concerns.
We have started to review several areas of our withdrawal and readmission policies.
Students have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT. The Committee on Academic Performance and the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Education will gather feedback from students and faculty, and recommend changes to bolster and clarify our policies this year.

>To develop long-term, data-driven solutions and tap the innovative thinking of our community, we are launching a new effort called the MindHandHeart Initiative. Co-sponsored by us, and led by Professor Rosalind Picard and a steering committee of students, faculty, staff, and experts on student health and wellness, MindHandHeart will foster and launch promising new efforts, and effectively leverage existing support services.
MindHandHeart's goal is clear: over time, we want members of our community to feel more comfortable asking for help when they need it, and we want to build a healthier, stronger community. Here is how you can help:
The MindHandHeart Innovation Fund is now accepting proposals from anyone in the community with an innovative wellness idea, such as last year's successful TMAYD — or ""Tell Me About Your Day"" — bracelets.
The ""Don't struggle alone — it's okay to ask for help"" public awareness campaign is designed to help struggling students overcome the common but misplaced fear that they will be judged harshly for feeling overwhelmed and seeking help. Please display the postcards and posters, share your own experiences with stress and uncertainty, and help us get the word out.
MindHandHeart is seeking members for its working groups. We urge you to volunteer!
At MIT, we excel at collaborating on hard problems. By continuing to tap our passionate community spirit and innovative problem-solving skills, we are confident we can make progress and enhance mental health and well-being at MIT.
We look forward to you joining us in this work.

MIT grad student looking for other grad student roommates,2,12,"I'm looking for roommates, preferably gay or queer females/trans/nonbinary/genderqueer (or VERY FRIENDLY to all of those) type folks for housing in Cambridge this upcoming school year. I am looking to start a lease in August/September.

I am looking for a place in Cambridge (preferably Central or Kendall Squares but this is flexible). I am in the process of looking for roommates in the hopes to get enough (cool, progressive) people together to maybe rent a house (maybe with a porch!?) However, this is also flexible-- if I find one awesome person then I am open to a two bedroom.

A little about me: 23 year old female (will be 24 this summer), starting a PhD program in biology at MIT. I identify as gay/queer. I expect to be super busy but I still want to actually be friends with my roommates, and not just share a house (being BEST friends isn't necessary). I'd like to have the kind of environment where we could share conversations/dinner/etc. I am looking for kind of a casual cooperative environment. I'm a nonsmoker and I plan on getting a cat. In my free time I like to read, go to concerts, do arts and crafts, and follow politics.

I'll be the area over the summer so we could potentially meet up then.

"International Prospective Student, need feedback.",2,5,"Hello, im a high school junior, currently living in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco Mexico,

The porpouse of this post is to know if i actually have a chance of getting admited, i think of admissions more than a chance of luck, because the stats are that about 6% get admitted, but his is not like the loto, like a lot of people think, i think it is more like the 6% are the kind of people MIT look for. Anyway

I dont know how to tell this without looking egocentric, but i will do my best.

Im a 17 years old junior who loves too baking, cooking, teaching and building motorized bikes, im currently a pastry chef, taekwondo black belt and i have a small business at my city where i sell and motorize people´s bikes. wich gives me a little profit for my projects, also i have went to statal math olympiads, science camps, google science fair, (which has given me lots of knowledge and experience) i kinda have an obsession with minimalist transportation like motorized bikes, i also did the first tutorials in spanish in youtube for building one, this was after seeing that it was the best i could do for spreading the word of mobikes, and lately i learned welding and made a bike trailer and a custom full suspension motorized bike which you can see at my youtube channel.

Here you can see the FB page where i upload my cooking, i started cooking at 10 because of curiosity and to save money because commercial food is crazy expensive, now i see this was like my introduction to chemistry, math and engineering.
https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Cocina-de-Abraham/276184484709?fref=ts

And here are my youtube channels 
https://www.youtube.com/user/NoxuzBlog
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGrl_njAhygpWu0LBAr8zQQ/feed

also this is kinda embarrasing but this is my first youtube channel when i was like 11, https://www.youtube.com/user/MINICH3F this videos were edited on a netbook lol.

Big part of my formation i owe it to my older brother, whom from very young teached me to be independent and to focus on my goals, also if im not learning something new, doing projects or helping others, i feel like im  worthless and i should not be wasting earths resources. also i was the kid in the kindergarden that could not sleep in the evening nap. i felt in that time that it was wasting time.

The main reason i want to go to MIT is because, from what i have seen  over there is the people who does not underestimate themselves, the people who know they are the future, i have been looking for this kind of people nearby. Also my classmates and friends look soo comformist and not worrying about anything, just following the educational system and wasting earth's resources. i have taken advantage of this by inviting friends to my house and they offer me to help on my projects.

Now to academics, i owe a HUGE to Khan Academy, i feel like without it, i would not be writing this, education here sucks, and after going to science camps i knew that it sucks everywhere, i just hate how this system forms employees,
Here the grades are scored by points from 0 to 100, anything above 59 means that you pass the course, i have always been between 90 and 95, i have seen that people who get straights 100 are just the most clevers, and think that their life will be realized by just sticking to get those grades, but i have seen that taking off school, must of them are nothing. 

I prefer tons of times more khan academy and online resources like OCW, than my actual teachers. i respect their vocation.

Anyway im currently studying for all the testing, TOEFL, Sat subject test. also im worried about the interview, im planning to visit campus soon, and i emailed if i could do the interview there because i dont think i could find an interviewer where i live, and they responded that they dont to interviews on campus. soo im like wtf.

Anyway what do you guys think of my curriculum, i did not did a lot of effort in grammar, but i think the message is clear. I have not listed all the activities and i know that i sound like a spoiled brat in some parts.

Thank you guys for your time.

NFC ARG in the tunnels?,6,0,"I was exploring the tunnels a bit with some friends today (Splash), and I noticed an NFC tag stuck to one of the maps. I scanned it, and it pointed us to another tunnel (K). I promptly wrote a quick ""we were here""-style message (keeping the pointer to K) and we all went to K, and found another tag pointing us to another tunnel. We eventually ended up at T after following a long chain of tags all around campus. There was no tag there, nor one anywhere in sight, and we even fanned out until we each reached separate dead ends or ""No Splash beyond this point"" signs. No tags, no messages, no prize.... So I scraped two tags off of my wallet, wrote my BTC address to one and a message to the ARG-maker on the other, and stuck them to the T map.

My point here being, has anybody seen or solved this puzzle/game before?",2n7l8w,MIT

I know I won't have a car, so I was just curious how much not having a car would impact me, in terms of needing to get places, etc. Is the public transportation in Houston good enough, or will I be screwed for not having a car?

Also, I need to get a job, and because I don't have a car and will be living on campus (not going home for the weekends) I was hoping I could get an on campus job. Are there many off campus jobs, and are they hard to get, because I don't know if I'd be able to manage an off campus job without a car. Or maybe I can?

Any insight would be appreciated, thanks.

Help a planning to be nutrition major decide on a college.,3,3,"I’m a high school senior and I want to major in nutrition. It’s kind of a new aspiration as I only find out about the major this week, but when I found out about it I was super passionate about the major (sometimes I act like a nutrition douche). I looked up the colleges with the nutrition majors and UH was one of them. Any advice about life on and off campus (housing) and class workload  and what campus is like on weekends would be greatly appreciated. And if there are any nutrition majors reading this can you tell me what class is like and what exactly we would be studying? Because I’ve seen a different post from a nutrition major and he said he had a whole “chopped” (the tv show)  themed type of exam or something like that.",b1kvpy,UniversityOfHouston
On-Campus Housing Concern,3,3,"Hi! So I just recently got accepted into UH as a transfer student and emailed the housing people about available housing in CP and Bayou Oaks, which they told me there was no housing actually available right now.

They said options should open up again by April 1st because of cancellations, is this true? I would hate to put down 300 dollars and then have to look for another place to live off-campus.

Where am I supposed to park on campus after hours?,11,9,"This is my first year living off-campus. I didn't expect to have a car this year, but things changed recently. I've never had to deal with UH parking, and since I didn't anticipate owning a car, I was late to sign up for the waitlists and could only get remote campus parking.

Anyway, the website says that remote campus students can only park at ERP until 4:00, but can park on campus after hours and on the weekends. Does that mean that I can park in ANY zone and/or lot after hours/on weekends? I know there are some parking lot areas that aren't listed as ""lots"" in this new system, like the one near Bauer ...?

The disappointment that is Lightview. A slight rant,129,51,"So for all of you are looking to vent about how we were promised a luxury experience and received plastic couches and tiny rooms, and for everyone looking to move here in the future, let’s give some clarity into what lightview is. It’s an apartment that is essentially a dorm room that you pay significantly more for. Because you need to have your own renters insurance, lightview isn’t liable for a lot of things that could go wrong. The rooms are much smaller than we were led to believe and you can’t tell that the building was put up in less than 2 years. The walls are paper thin so you better hope that your neighbors aren’t loudly fucking all the time. Starting at the end of next week, we not only will have to tap in through the front door, and at the security desk. We will also need to tap to operate the elevators. You can hear the water running through the walls when anybody above you flushed the toilet or showers and they are already beginning to change their policies. Northeastern is now requiring that lightview change their policy on signing in guests and they are also changing their strange, but welcomed smoking in the rooms policy. The kitchens have almost no storage and although the closets are large, the credenzas are not, so be sure to bring your own storage solution. The beds are large but stiff so a mattress pad is probably a necessity, and the lights are on motion sensors so be sure to turn them off before going to bed or you’ll be turning all the lights on in the apartment when you get up to use the bathroom. The nicest and largest rooms are definitely the 4 bedroom, 4 bath, but the kitchen has no more space than a smaller room arrangement. The facilities are nice, but I emailed 3 times about the on site gym to see if it would be fully equipped with free weights and every time they assured me it would be. The gym has no free weight bench set or squat rack. There is one smith machine and dumbbells that only go up to 75 pounds. This is likely for safety reasons so the gym can be open 24/7 but still. I was excited to have an on site bench press. The WiFi is very good, but still slower than promised and I have yet to try out the cable package. Overall, a lot of us are downgrading from our on campus housing and are spending a lot more money. Yeah it comes fully furnished, but it’s really shitty furniture and the cable and internet packages are nice, but still not worth the up to $1800 per month price tag on the most expensive rooms. For much cheaper, I could’ve gotten off campus housing that I would’ve been much happier in. Hopefully this year will fly by because I will not be resigning next September.",cvqypf,NEU

You'll get the registrar, dining websites, pdfs, but **never** will you get the actual website (I checked search cache and Google genuinely doesn't index any of the pages).

What are the pros and cons of living on campus/off campus?,3,3,"Hello there. I will be coming to UVa next year for my PhD. I haven't been to the US before but it seems like on campus housing is a lot cheaper (~400 USD including utilities, furnished, in 3 bedroom apt).

So can you guys please enlighten me on the pros and cons of living off campus or on campus and how competitive it is to get a spot in one of the dorms.

I'm an exchange student from Australia (G'day mates) who is going to be studying at UVa for the Fall 2018 term. After looking a little bit online, I have realized that I am thoroughly out of my depth. Do you guys have any advice (or leads) that you think could be useful for someone who knows nothing on the following topics:

1. Housing - I need a place to live and really would like to get this out of the way promptly. I've already joined the off campus page, but if you guys know people looking for roomates, or just have some general advice that would be awesome!

2. College life/Culture - I fancy myself a reasonably social individual, do any of you have any hot tips for the best way to get involved with the social scene at UVa. I notice you guys call yourselves ""Wahoos"" - what is a Wahoo and how do I go about becoming one?

On top of that If you guys can think of any good advice for an exchange student (no matter how dumb), I'd really be quite terribly grateful to you!

Another First Year Planning for His Future... (housing and study abroad),3,3,"Hey guys! I'm a first year in the College, having a good time here at UVA. Right now though, it's somewhat of a stressful weekend what with all the planning I have to do. So I'll boil it down to two main topics:

1. Second Year Housing - I've heard not so great things about living on-campus next year (eg. long walks, no air conditioning). Would you guys recommend quickly grabbing some friends and signing a lease on off campus housing, or has your on-campus experience been good as well? This will be super helpful to the dozens of first years browsing here frequently as well haha.

2. One of the main things I've been looking forward to at UVA is the potential to study abroad. Being in Chinese and potentially majoring in Foreign Affairs, I have particular interest in visiting China and potentially another country as well. But my question is when. I know each semester carries its own pros and cons when it comes to study abroad, so I'm trying to get some anecdotes to back up my decision. How were your study abroad experiences and do you regret the specific timing of when you went?",3milzf,UVA

How has this worked for students anyone knows compared to spreading them out?",4vhszj,UVA
Questions for people in Faulkner/Copley,3,6,"I'm considering housing for next year and it's between off-grounds and Faulkner/Copley.

My Coach Bennett Story,43,2,"I put this up on Facebook but I feel like others beside my small group should know.

Quick back story before the wall of text. I'm 29. I was born, raised, and currently reside in the Charlottesville metropolitan area(Albemarle county). I've been to countless UVA football and basketball games, going back to Welsh and Gillien. My mom has been a nurse at UVA for over 25 years. I have an uncle, a great uncle, a cousin,  and a grandfather who have attended UVA. However, UVA fandom did not rub off on me. This story is one of three Coach Bennett stories that I have, the other two are just seeing him in public.

My Tony Bennett Story.

As many of you know, I am by no means a UVA athletics fan and I wont be jumping on the bandwagon just because they won the Tournament. However, a couple years ago I worked for Papa John's delivering pizza and our delivery area covered the UVA campus. I got a delivery assignment for around 30 pizzas to the Batten School on McCormick road. I parked behind the car that I essentially followed the whole way there. As I was pulling the bags from my car, I looked up to see Coach Bennett exiting the car. I was following him as he was going the same direction as me. It became clear we were headed to the same destination and he held the door as I carried the pizzas in. I met up with my person of contact for the order and followed them into a large room where I became aware that Bennett would be speaking. A short side note is that each pizza bag holds 5 pizzas. To ensure the quality of the pizza, a driver shouldnt carry more than 2 bags as they can be awkward to hold, causing pizzas to slide around and get damaged. So this delivery was going to require multiple trips to the car due to the amount of pizzas and that they had also ordered several 2 liters. For each trip to and from, the door was held open not by the person of contact, not by the students who were arriving for Bennett's lecture, (ironically the Batten school is for leadership) but by Coach Bennett himself. What impressed me most was the entire time the people facilitating the lecture, including my person of contact, were so focused on kissing his ass and doing everything they could for him, that they didnt see the irony in him helping somebody so far beneath him in the pecking order of the event. Will I become a UVA fan? Probably not. Do I respect Tony Bennett for the simple decency of helping the lowly pizza delivery guy? Absolutely. So congratulations to Coach Bennett on the Championship and I hope Miami beats you next year. :)",bcy4rz,UVA
Which one is better: UVA or UC Berkeley?,3,11,"Hey guys, I'm an international student who applied to 14 US colleges, and got rejected and waitlisted by a ton.

Rejected: UPenn (ED), UChicago (ED2), Brown, Dartmouth, USC, NYU, Emory

Waitlisted: Boston College, Purdue, UCLA, UC Berkeley

Accepted: UC Davis, UC San Diego, UVA

Berkeley waitlists very few people, and since their yield is quite low, they end up accepting about half of their waitlisted students (last year was 54%). Assuming I get off the waitlist, I was wondering which university would be better between UVA and Berkeley for an international student.

I applied for economics at UVA (want to go to McIntire later) and at UC Berkeley. I'm thinking of eventually working in finance, and while I know UVA is a feeder for Wall Street firms, I find it hard to forgo Berkeley's arguably better international reputation so easily.

UVA Pros:

1. Literally called a Public Ivy for a reason

2. Really good economics program, and McIntire is also a great business school and isn't as competitive to get into

3. Charlottesville seems like a nice university town, so I won't be stressed all the time as I am in high school (IB diploma student). Definitely nowhere as stressful as Berkeley, where I have to compete with crazy-competitive Asians from the Bay Area and competitive countries like Singapore, China, India, etc (I'm Indian myself but I have spent my entire life in other countries) to get into the business school and to get good internships.

4. Good social scene (but I'm borderline nerdy, so while I do have many friends, not many of them are the kind of people who get drunk every weekend and are super social)

5. Campus is so beautiful

UC Berkeley Pros:

1. Arguably better international reputation than UVA (not really a dealbreaker as I plan to stay in the US after graduation anyways)

2. Greater international student population (easier for me to integrate into the community)

3. Another Public Ivy, and arguably better at economics than UVA

4. Campus is so beautiful like UVA, but there are also more things to do in Berkeley than in Charlottesville.

5. Not as much focus on Greek life (I'm not really sure how dominant Greek life is at UVA, but I hear it's pretty popular and that to get into McIntire or Wall Street, being in a fraternity is almost mandatory)

I can't think of any other pros for either university, and I'd like your input on this. I would also appreciate any insight from international students at UVA regarding your experiences.

Thanks!",b774f5,UVA
First time attending a UVA game,12,25,"First off, if this sub is more for academics, I understand. I’m also going to post in r/Wahoowa in case that’s a better sub for this kind of stuff.

My girlfriend is a student at Liberty, and I’ll be visiting her next weekend. We will be traveling to Charlottesville for the Liberty/UVA game on November 10. Neither of us have been to a UVA game before, but she’s fairly familiar with Virginia’s campus.

Basically, I’d like to know if there’s anything I need to be aware of with a typical UVA game. So here is a list of questions:

Will we be required to get to campus a certain way? 
What is parking going to be like? Will we need a parking pass?
Is there a food place we have to check out? 
Are there cool traditions we should know about? I’m particularly interested to see if there’s neat marching band stuff - I marched in college. 
Is there anything else that we should know ahead of time?

I just graduated from Penn State, where there’s so much going on in a typical game day. These are things you have to know if you want a successful PSU game experience. So I figured I should check on these with UVA.

Thanks, and congrats on your ranking in all the major polls! Following UVA from afar has been fun this season, and I’m really hoping to see you in the ACCCG.",9t9n6x,UVA
Questions from a prospective Hoo,8,6,"So I was recently admitted as a second year transfer for SEAS \(yay!\) and plan on declaring CS. I was also admitted to VT for engineering so I'm trying to decide between the two. I've done a bunch of research on the programs of both schools and I've realized that they're both fantastic institutions for my major and my success is going to come down to what I do in school more than which school I pick. I'm mostly basing my decision on the lifestyle I want in college and the cost. So I've listed a bunch of questions and appreciate if you all could answer any of them.

1. What's the running culture like in Cville/UVA? Are there good running routes around campus. Are there places I can run safely at night \(I'm a tall white guy\)?
2. Is there any fun stuff to do on weekends that don't involve drinking/drugs?
3. I've heard pretty unanimous agreement that UVA's dining isn't the best. Are there enough good restaurants on/close to grounds that you can mostly avoid dining hall food? Isn't there like one good dining hall? Furthermore are there any affordable/accessible grocery stores so that I could make my own food?
4. Is the fratty/preppy culture as prevalent as everyone says?
5. How's Charlottesville's public transit? Is it a big inconvenience if you don't have a car?
6. What's a brief summary of the different areas there are to live off grounds? 
7. To people who transfered: How was the transfer process? Smooth/Rough? Anything I should keep in mind my first few weeks?
8. I'm planning on visiting within the next few days. I know you're all in finals so I was planning on mostly showing myself around. Anything I should keep my eye out for / check out regarding my above questions? 

Some information I'd want to add is that I'm transferring from a private 4 year school. UVA is instate for me and I already have a bunch of friends that go there. I have a friend who is also transferring and probably will room with them. I'm leaning towards UVA just because I'm from nova and I'd like to stay not too far from home. I also feel like I'd enjoy living in Charlottesville over Blacksburg. I greatly appreciate any information you all can give me. ",8gfahu,UVA
Living cheap,12,1,"Edit: For the record, I never asked any questions about rent because I saw some people get the cold shoulder for bringing those questions here instead of doing their own apartment shopping ;) But I appreciate anything you know about that, too! I just wanted to clarify that here, I'm asking about other costs of living.

-

I'm coming to UVA as a grad student in the fall and I have some questions about cost of living.

I'm thrifty -- I do most of my food/ clothes/ home shopping at thrift, secondhand, and discount stores. Are there any of these near campus? (Within walking/ cycling distance.)

Is Charlottesville an expensive place to live? Considering I'll be living off a grad student's stipend, probably while trying to chip at undergrad loans.

Do students get nice discounts at places & events in town, and do discounts generally apply to grad students?

ps: I'm excited",5y2oyk,UVA
Questions on UVA Parking,4,5,"Recently admitted to a UVA grad program and will begin in July (end in May) - was hoping someone who has experience with parking on campus could give me some advice.

It's our second longest game series (the longest being below's UNC rivalry), but it's the one that gets our blood pumping and brings out the worst/best in us as football fans. AFter that humiliating shutout a few years ago, when we had just broke the rankings at #24, it led the way to a humbling end of our season loss to Clemson in the Bowl game. Many hope to attend UVA during a year we win that game, and last year we came close, losing by 4.
* [](/northcarolina): **[""The South's Oldest Rivalry""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%27s_Oldest_Rivalry)**. The longest football series in the ACC, this series is very close with UNC leading overall 59-54-4. The last few years have been going UNC's way, but UVA has a 20-9 record since 1983. We hope to break their small streak before it continues and even the series up.
* [](/maryland): **[The Beltway Brawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%E2%80%93Virginia_football_rivalry)**, UVA has been winning more of the last 6 or so, with Maryland winning the most recent game, and leading the series overall 43–32–2.

*Traditions*
****
* Probably our most well-known gameday tradition: ""Guys in Ties, Girls in Pearls"". When UVA first started participating in college football, it was an all-male school. Football games were seen as a social event, and as men are wont to do to impress others, they wore dress shirts, slacks and [blue and orange] ties. They would also bring their girlfriends to these games, and the girls would wear sundresses and pearl necklaces (weather permitting). The attire evolved over the years to include the occasional blazer, Sperry boatshoe, and of course, the ultimate sign of being a man, a bow tie. However, the premise for the tradition - men wearing ties and women wearing pearl necklaces - remains, even in this ""COLOR OUT"" era.

[Bonus picture of some fans wearing ties and pearls.](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png) [(pfs3w - I'm the guy with the obscenely orange glasses :P)](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png)

He then rides around and enters the stadium on Sabre (the horse) while AC/DC's Thunderstruck or ZombieNation plays.   

* We have a fight song, but after every score and game, we sing the alumni song *The Good Ole Song*, in which we all join arms. The song has [gained some notoriety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Old_Song) in past years after students would add to the lyrics ""We come from old Vir-gin-ia, where all is bright and gay"", by chanting ""NOT GAY"". A petition successfully stopped this practice, and now we chant ""FUCK TECH!"" in reference to VirginiaTech instead. You can find the song [HERE](http://fightmusic.com/acc.html) if you search ""Good Old Song"".

**City Population:** 43,375  
[**City Skyline**](http://www.readthehook.com/files/news-sunrisedowntown-m_0.jpg)   
**Iconic Building on Grounds:** [The Rotunda](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/University_of_Virginia_Rotunda_2006.jpg): Our most iconic building, and the biggest architectural draw we have, aside from *The Lawn* on which it stands. Was formerly a library in the University's oldest days, it burned down in 1895, and was restored in the years following. Now, it serves as a cornerstone of Jeffersonian architecture, and the face of the University.

**Iconic Location on Grounds:** [The Lawn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawn) is our large grass court at the base of the Rotunda, which extends all the way down our 52-Pavilion Academical Village. During the warmer temps of the Spring and early Summer, it is often filled with students relaxing on the grass, sun bathing, studying, or playing the occasional game of Ultimate Frisbee.   


**Local Dining:**

* [The Virginian](http://www.brobible.com/college/article/100-best-college-bars-bros-2/page-2), known as ""the Virge"", is a popular [sports] bar on an area just outside of ~~campus~~ Grounds that we  call The Corner. #26 in the Brobible's top 100 college bars.

* Marco & Luca’s on The Corner for the best dumplings you'll probably ever have.

* If you are a college bro type, check out Little John's NY style deli after hours on the Corner, and try the Chris Long sub or the 21 Society.

* Fine dining can be found everywhere at [The Downtown Mall](http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/restaurants/).

*Random Trivia*
***
* UVA is the only college campus to be a designated *UNESCO* World Heritage Site.

* The original College was architected by Thomas Jefferson, whose original buildings can be seen in the area we call *The Lawn*. The Rotunda building was originally a library.

* Maryland's grass thing is the only grass lawn larger than our own, by less than a foot. (Someone will probably post the actual metrics and prove me wrong)

* Wake Forest Head Coach Jim Grobe played football at UVA. Our greatest coach, George Welsh, was an assistant under JoePa at Penn State.

* There is an acclaimed but unproven game of football that occurred just two years after the historic Rutgers-Yale game that started college ball.

* The last time UVA held a series lead over VT in the Commonwealth Cup was in 1960, and the current drought goes back to 2003, when Matt Schaub and Heath Miller played on the team (additionally, we've only won 1 of the last 15).

* UVA was involved in a controversy in 2002 at the inaugural Continental Tire bowl against West Virginia, when during the halftime show, the now extinct independent pep band staged a rendition of ""The Bachelor"" with two contests: one being depicted as a well-educated UVA woman and the other as a ""bumpkin"" WVU woman.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***

> Mike London came in with the intent of changing the attitude toward recruiting and player development from the way Al Groh was running the program. London has placed an increased emphasis on recruiting in-state talent (with great success). I think when London first came on as head coach, many were willing to wait several years (or at least until he had several years of recruiting his own players) to judge his success as a coach. Following a pretty lucky 8-4 campaign two years ago, expectations rose among the UVA fan base. What followed was a pretty mediocre season last year. UVA had one of the youngest secondaries in all of college football last year, and the inexperience on defense combined with underwhelming offensive production (particularly in the ground game, where we returned several good running backs and an offensive line with at least two potential first rounders) led to a poor record.

> Unfortunately in this coming season, UVA will be facing an extremely tough schedule with a crossover division game against Clemson and OOC games against BYU and Oregon (and a not as bad as you might think Ball State team). A bowl game would be considered a victory in my mind. There still is hope for the future, as UVA continues to recruit well. It also will be interesting to see how the new coaches/coordinators impact the success of the team. I just don't see how with these new coaches and still relatively young team that UVA has a winning record in the 2013.

Considering a transfer,5,7,"Hello wahoos

I'm currently a college freshman considering transferring to UVA and hoping you guys help me with some questions.

First off, how realistic do you think my chances are? I applied as a reach as a first year and, as expected, was denied admission. I got a 4.0 gpa my first semester at another VA public school. Also, what would anyone suggest that might improve my chances (other then getting good grades next semester)?

Secondly, could anyone share their experience as a transfer student? Where I am currently I'm pretty un-happy with my social experience, and having wanted to go the UVA last year and it being a more prestigious school, I don't see the harm in trying. However, I do have a fear that I might have less friends or be generally have as good as a social life as I do now (which isn't great). Point being, I don't think I'd be leaving a great group of friends if I transfer, but would being a transfer at UVA be any different?

A little about me: I had a 1880 SAT and 3.7 GPA in highschool. I am a Government and International Affairs major. I am involved with Catholic Campus Ministry and College Democrats at my current school. I am also looking into greek life this spring or next fall potentially. I'd like to work in the field of public policy one day, at a lobbying firm or on the hill. I have also started considering law school.

Anyone can chime in. Taking all advice. Think I've got a good shot? Think UVA is a place a transfer student can make friends? Think I'm a lost cause? Let me know.",2rthcd,UVA
Living on The Range,7,2,"Hello everyone! I just found out yesterday that I've been accepted to the Curry School  to get my master's in special education. I'm not 100% sure that I will accept yet (still waiting to hear back from some other programs) but I'm really excited about the opportunity to actually be a Wahoo! 

I'm currently a senior (fourth year, as you say!) at JMU, but UVA was my top choice for undergrad. Unfortunately I wasn't accepted back then. I've been to Charlottesville several times and I absolutely love the area. I've been looking into housing options if I accept the offer, and I came across The Range. I read most of the FAQ on the website, but I was wondering if any UVA redditors have thoughts/experience to contribute. It seems like a unique and really fun living experience, but I do have some hesitation. Mainly, I've been living in an apartment for the past 2 years and I've become quite accustomed to having a full kitchen and my own en suite bathroom. I also have been considering getting a dog/cat and that wouldn't be possible living on The Range. But I never got the chance to have the real UVA experience, and I feel like it would help me make connections with the campus.

I also see that it is competitive to live there, and most people advise attending an open house (which would be no problem as I am only an hour away) but if there's anything else that would make me a more competitive applicant I would be interested to hear it. Really, I just want to know if it's worth it. Will I gain more from living on the Range than I would living off grounds? What's it like? 

Thanks to anyone who can provide some insight. Either way, super excited that I was accepted :) ",48km2v,UVA
'80s Ponytail Snatcher?,17,8,"My father used to tell this story of how, when he was at UVA in the mid-80's (class of '87), the library (or one of them, I'm not familiar with the campus) was open at all hours but was chronically understaffed, so in the wee small hours there would only be one or two people manning the doors and checkout counter and nobody watching the upper floors. According to him, after a while reports started to trickle in of girls who had been trying to pull all-nighters in the library and had fallen asleep at their desks, and when they woke up, their ponytails were gone- cut off by some creep in the night for unknown but presumably unwholesome purposes. As far as my father knows, the culprit was never caught.

Does anybody know more about this- who did it, whether they were caught, whether my dad is just telling tall tales?",1am8up,UVA
Average GPA for transfer?,5,5,"Hi, I'm looking to transfer to SEAS as a Systems Engineering major.  My school doesn't offer the major nor conduct any research in the area. I'll be applying for the fall of 2015. So far, I've completed three semesters of school (I'm taking the fall 2014 semester off to work fulltime due to finances). Currently, I'm attending a state flagship on the east coast (non-Virginia resident) as an statistics and econ major. My overall GPA is 3.65 with 59 credits completed so far. I'm concerned since my GPA seems to be on the lower side. I had two good semesters, my first (3.85 w/19credits) and third- 4.0 w/22credits. However, my second semester, my GPA slipped to a 3.07 (18 credits). I don't have any excuses other than underestimating my course load and having a poor work ethic. I've learned my lesson since. I also have two great recs and am involved on campus (research assistant,club president,etc.). GPA based on stats classes is ~3.9, but econ major GPA is 3.45 (1 C+, and B, remaining As/A-s). I have completedthe prerequisite courses for engineering (Calc,chem, physics,etc.).

Those of you who live off campus and take RTS in for classes, how long is your average commute, and how long do you usually have to wait for buses? If you feel comfortable, which areas/routes do you use most frequently? If your commute is long, how do you make it less boring/be productive? Lastly, would you consider it worth it to potentially pay “more for less” (read: fewer bathrooms) just to live closer to campus? Thanks in advance for the input! :)

Experience with Off-Campus Housing and Pet Rodents?,2,4,"I know UF’s on-campus housing allows most types of rodents, but I’ll be living off campus this coming Fall semester. I happen to have a hamster, and I don’t feel comfortable leaving him in the care of my family for a large portion of the year—for a few reasons, but among them being that I don’t want to be absent for such a long chunk of the year when he already has such a short life span.

So I’m wondering! Fellow rodent owners here who have lived off-campus, what’s been your experience with bringing your rodent along? Any places nearby the UF campus that are accepting of them? Most places only mention cats or dogs, and I haven’t had much luck trying to contact property managers about it, and it’s important to me to find a place where my little fuzzball can come with.

Budget wise, he wants around $500 a month for everything since he cant afford anything more than that. I'm the same way, although I have to tackle on a little more payments such as my car and car insurance.

Riker hall vs off-campus housing?,4,9,"Hello! I am an student coming over for an exchange year, but I am in a dilemma regarding housing now. I really hope some insiders here can give me a hand:/ I have been allocated to a double room at Riker Hall, but I can barely find a proper review on this. I just wonder if someone used to stay at Riker can give me some clue?

Shower room - do they look new or old? 

I know they refurbished it 10 years ago but there is no actual photo of how the shower room looks like. As a guy, I know bathrooms can smell at times. Do they even separate the communal toilet and showers?  

Soundproofing - I am a super light sleeper and I can't deal with minimal voice even if ppl are just talking outside. Is Riker Hall good at sound insulation? I saw one said ppl could barely hear anything outside the room even if someone was playing loud music in his room; I am not sure if it's true though. Also, fingers crossed no one is having party on my floor :( I'll be f*** up if that happened.

Social - How is social life at Riker? 

Tbh I am not that outgoing, and I am not into group events so I look forward to be a really good friend with my roommate. But my roommate is supposed to be in sophomore year (I don't think I will be put with a freshman tho) and it's likely he has his own circle already; it seems stupid to stay at hall rooms just to look for friends to hang out and share my heart with.

I have never stayed in a double room and my sleeping pattern fluctuates so I am also thinking about University House - the location is perfect for me as it is right next to business school, and the conditions seem much better too - got a private bathroom, private bedroom in double size, and... a swimming pool! 

I am just not sure if it will be easy to make friends at University House as it's a private accommodation anyway. In my host university I am staying in private sector and my friends are all outside my house, so I worry this will be the same at Uf. 

If someone could give me reviews or thoughts on either Riker or University House, I will be forever grateful! 

Thanks,

1. Dorms would be more expensive than finding something off campus, especially since you have to buy a meal plan if you live in dorms.

Anyone with an experience of being a visiting student at NYU (NYC) in fall or spring semester?,5,0,"I am currently a college sophomore considering about participating in a visiting student program at NYU for fall. I have tried to find websites with people's comments/descriptions of what their experiences were like as visiting students, but I wasn't able to find any. So here I am, wanting to get a glimpse into the lives of those just coming to NYU for a semester or so. 
 
To people who have done the visiting student program, what do you think of it? Is it worth doing? Was registering/getting into classes that you wanted difficult, as I assume visiting students register for classes much later than the already-enrolled students? What was the housing condition like, especially for an entering junior? If you lived in a dorm, did the school pair you up with a roommate or did you have a choice in your room assignment? If not, was looking for an off-campus housing difficult? Also, if you have stayed in NYU for a year, what was the application to stay for the second semester like? What was the likelihood of NYU letting you to stay?
 
To anyone who has studied at NYU, are there a lot of visiting students in NYU in any semester? Just a super rough estimate is fine here. I just want to know the dynamics of student population in NYU.
 
I would really appreciate if anyone can provide full or even partial answers to my questions. Any insights/tips/suggestions would be very helpful. Please help me clear up some of my confusions 🙏🙏

# The most important thing

Realize everybody is as nervous as you! College is fucking scary and everybody is trying to look more confident than they really are as they try to settle in and make friends. Don't be afraid to push yourself into engaging with as many groups and individuals as you can during the first few weeks. It might look like friend groups have already formed after only a day or two (""oh man, those guys have already grabbed dinner twice and have been playing poker all night, no way I can squeeze in now"") but everything will be very fluid for the first few months so don't worry if you haven't found your groove off the bat. Sometimes hanging out with people you don't totally 'click' with can lead you to meet people who become your true friends later on. Also don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself or coming off weird—everybody is too busy adjusting to their new environment to care. It's cliche but be yourself, campus is big enough that you'll find the right crew for your weird-ass self.

# Safety

Honestly, the city (and especially the village) is pretty safe. Regardless, there's some hazards to watch out for, especially the goddamn delivery bicyclists. I really do think they're the biggest danger to NYU students right now; they'll sneak up on you at 20+mph going the wrong way on the street so please look up from your phone and look both ways. It's a touchy subject because many of them are undocumented citizens looking for stable income, speaking of which always tip in cash if you get seamless delivery to your dorm like the lazy ass you are. 


**Street Smahts** 

There are a ton of scammers on the street and people generally looking to get *something* out of you, **never** make eye contact with anyone and just keep walking. Trust me. That woman asking for $4.50 for a bus ticket home? She's there every day. Kids asking for money for their school team? There's no team. Etc, etc. New Yorkers are a jaded but very helpful bunch, if you need something don't start with ""Excuse me"" but just ask directly like ""Which way to X"".

Everything else about the safety in the city you'll have hammered into your minds so I won't touch on it. 

**Booze**

It's everywhere. We know it, the police know it, the RAs know it, and everybody sort of turns a blind eye as long as you're not being too obvious. Please don't be the kid leaving in an ambulance on a Friday night because it happens regularly. The best way to not get a hangover is to drink a glass of water between every shot or can of beer, and don't buy that disgusting ~~liquor~~ gasoline in plastic bottles or god forbid, Chateau Diana from Duane Read  (they can't legally sell wine so it's half strength ""wine product""). Shame anybody who buys that crap. 

Freshmen tend to have a ""go hard or go home"" attitude about alcohol but chilling with some wine/beer and playing boardgames or watching a movie is very underrated and usually ends up being a better time than dragging your ass to whatever shitty clubs are letting in freshmen. 

**Weed**

I'm not saying cartridges are the superior option...but cartridges are the superior option. If you get caught with one I don't know how you got into NYU, and even then you can say it's CBD and all they can do is shrug. But hey, it's NYC and the police DGAF so again, don't be dumb about it if you buy bud. Just please don't become *that kid* who is high 24/7 and lost all motivation in life.

# Money Money Money 💸

⚠️**STOP BUYING TEXTBOOKS** ⚠️

For the LOVE of GOD please check libgen.is for your books before giving any money to the greedy fucks who run the textbook racket. If that URL goes down search for 'library genesis'. If you can't find your book there, you can google ""Book Name filetype:pdf"" but if you hit a site with a survey don't bother. If you like physical copies, Bobst tends to keep some copies of textbooks used for classes so alternatively you can try to reserve it as soon as the syllabus comes out (sorry if I just ruined this for anyone). 

**Don't buy microsoft office**

Please don't spend money on Microsoft Office. Create an account with your NYU email [here](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) and once you sign in, look for [this](https://i.imgur.com/5nLjxDL.png) button to download office for free to your laptop.

**Get a credit card**

This is a bit of a weird one because it's very easy to *lose* money with one, but hear me out. Starting to build credit now and graduating with a 700+ credit score will help you out a ton when buying a car, a house, refinancing anything, etc. Not to mention you can get cashback rewards and better consumer protections, just treat it like a debit card, pay your bill every month, and don't spend what you don't have. I recommend the Discover It card, they give out $20 a year for having good grades and there's decent rewards. 

**Budget appeal**

Hidden within Albert is a budget appeal form, it's *intended* for special circumstances but I've heard of them tossing a couple thousand someone's way every semester if you just say ""yo...shit's expensive"" (well realistically it depends on your FAFSA results but mentioning the burden of college on your family/yourself typically works if those numbers are in your favor).

# College Lyfe

**Go abroad** 

I initially thought I wouldn't do it but after going to London I would 100% recommend it. NYU is insanely invested in campuses overseas and it would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. It really does feel like a vacation, nobody has jobs or club leadership obligations so everybody is always down to hang out and travel. Plus the tight global campuses can give you a taste of the small college life you gave up by going here. 

**Clubs**

Absolutely join some clubs and even angle yourself for a leadership position if you find a group of people you'd like working with, I didn't do this as much as I'd like and I do regret it. On the flip side, don't spread yourself too thin and only have one foot in the water—you're not doing yourself or anybody else any favors then. 

**Long Distance Relationships UwU**

I'm not pretending to be an expert but I've seen some nasty breakups between long-distance couples in college, mostly in the first semester. But I've also seen some successes and even an engagement so don't give up if you think you have something special. Just be real with yourself and your partner, if you're not rock solid before college it's probably not the best move to keep it going, people change during college and trying to cling to something just because you've already put in so much time/effort only leads to pain. 

**Don't stand in the fucking way**

Space is tight in NYC and if you or a group of people stand around on a busy sidewalk or after getting through a door/escalator/elevator you'll become the most hated person on the planet for a moment. Please have some situational awareness.

"By Popular Request: Finding an Apartment in NYC (Alternate title: “Broker's fee? Oh God, I’m going to end up living in a cardboard box”)",26,5,"By popular request from the last [mega-thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/24ze2k/four_years_of_advice_from_an_outgoing_senior/), today you're going to learn how to navigate the NYC real estate market as an NYU student. 

**To start off: NYU Housing is pretty good, on the scale of things.**

NYU Housing will run you about $1500 per month. You can beat this price off-campus, but it'll take some work. Our housing is a pretty good deal- you're near campus, you have a doorman, you've got dining halls. There are plenty of good dorms, and you'll have a good time no matter which dorm you're in as long as you leave your dorm open and seek out friends and opportunities proactively. If you can't quench the desire to be king of your own domain, though, let's talk about how to navigate this real estate market. 

* **There are two categories of apartments when it comes to transportation cost: Walking distance, and subway distance.**

A subway ride currently costs $2.50 per ride, and a 30-day unlimited costs $112. This means that on your 49th subway ride in a given month, an unlimited card makes financial sense. If you're making one round-trip every day, the unlimited card makes sense. There will be days when you make more than one round trip. Once you have an unlimited card, that $112 is a sunk cost and it doesn't matter whether you're living 30 blocks from campus or 100 blocks from campus. You are now ""subway distance.""

Add in some cost for cab rides- maybe you've been at a bar for one round too many, or you wake up 15 minutes before a final and live 50 blocks off campus, or you and your romantic interest want to get back to your place in a hurry. Whatever the reason, tack on $50-75 in cab rides. 

What does all of this mean? It means that with approximately $175/mo in transportation costs, you'd better be saving more than that amount in rent differences. Moving to Williamsburg because the rent is $100 cheaper than the village is actually more expensive than taking the higher rent and walking to class. You can certainly save money with cheaper off-campus apartments, but make sure you're factoring transportation cost in. 

* **You will have much more space, but your friends might not want to visit you.**

I was living up in the 130s by Riverside Drive (or as my friends called it, ""Connecticut"") my sophomore year. It was a beautiful, spacious apartment for 60% the price of NYU housing with a full kitchen, brand new hardwood floors, and a view of the river- and it was always empty, because that's a long haul to come visit. If you're living far from campus when your friends call you on a Friday night to go out, you'll be the one traveling downtown to meet them. ""I'll be there in 45 minutes to an hour!"" became a common phrase. Keep in mind, also, that in the wee hours of the morning trains run every 20 minutes. This will feel like an eternity at 3AM, and you may end up crashing downtown with your friends just to avoid this.

The next year, I lived in a tiny overpriced shoebox apartment in SoHo that barely fit a queen bed, but my friends were over all the time and I was 5 minutes from class.

Weigh the pros and cons of this: You may have your dream apartment that's a relaxing sanctuary from the activity of the city, but a 1.0-1.5 hour round-trip commute is no joke, especially when you forget that essay and have to do that commute twice in a day. Bring a good book. 

* **The East Village has some great apartments hidden within 10,000 mislabeled scam advertisements.**

Expect about a 10% return rate on hunting for apartments within the East Village: For every 10 you do a viewing of, 9 will be mislabeled or have some fatal flaw: *""Why is there a bunk bed built into the kitchen wall? That's one of our three bedrooms?""* The tenth will be a place you actually could live at a price slightly higher than you wanted. Get into the habit of calculating price per square foot, accepting that half the time they will either claim not to have (or refuse to give you) a floorplan of the apartment. Start bringing a tape measure and making your own measurements when you view places. 

You're going to get a lot of ""bait and switch"" situations, which are illegal but inevitable. You'll call about apartment #5A that you saw on Craigslist, the one that's right in your ideal price zone and has the kitchen with the beautiful exposed brick. The guy on the other end will say *""Oh, 5A was rented last week but 7A is open- it's $200 more and has one fewer bedroom, but lets set up an appointment for you to look at it!""* Then, a week later, you'll see #5A listed again on a brand new listing. The apartment might not even exist. Be wary of this tactic, and don't let them use it to force you into a place you don't want. 

* **Don't sign anything or give anyone any money until you're absolutely sure you've found the right place and are ready to move ahead with it.**

If they're trying to get you to sign papers while viewing a place or to in any way [get a single cent of your money](http://i.imgur.com/ILEm3m9.jpg), say no. You always have the right to say no, and walk out the door. Ten other scumbags will line up to take their place. And read absolutely everything you ever sign, without exception. Don't sign anything you don't understand. 

If you're being pressured to sign something without reading it, something is wrong. I've had brokers try and force us to sign exclusivity agreements that said that if we used any other broker, we would owe them thousands of dollars. I'm the guy in my group of friends that actually reads contracts and terms of service, which my friends started to appreciate after that. You're in college now, you're legal adults, and if you put your name on paper it's legally binding.

* **Regarding safe neighborhoods**

I'll be blunt here: If you see buildings that look like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Gompers_NYCHA_from_WBB_jeh.jpg), do not live in that area. These are city housing projects. There is a disproportionate amount of crime that occurs inside these areas and in the blocks surrounding. I have worked with law enforcement in the past, just take my word for it. While [StuyTown](http://1monthop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/alg_yh_stuyvesant.jpg) looks like these projects, it's a privately owned development on the Lower East Side that I'll talk about more later. 

Other neighborhood advice. If you're living anywhere in Harlem, live as far West as possible. I was on Riverside Drive off of the 1 train and it was great. The closer you get to Amsterdam Ave, the sketchier the neighborhood is. Amsterdam and 125th is the worst area. 

The East Village is safe, although it wasn't 20-30 years ago. Things can get a little sketchy when you start passing Avenue C late at night, but that's about it. 

Never live in BedStuy, ever, without exceptions. The apartments are that cheap for a reason. This is not a trendy, edgy area that you can live in to show your friends that you're hip and don't like gentrification. It's the hood.

If your significant other came to visit you at 11PM, would she/he be safe on the walk over? If a place puts you on edge, lean towards no. 

For the most part, you'll be pretty safe anywhere in Manhattan (or just across the water in Brooklyn) as long as you follow your gut and [keep away from the housing projects.](http://i.imgur.com/ky5Hroh.jpg) 

* **Broker's Fees**

It's become common in NYC to have a ""broker's fee"" of 15% of your yearly rent that gets paid to the broker as a reward for finding you the place. Sometimes you can negotiate down this fee to 12.5% or 10%, which is better. This is a lot of money- a few thousand dollars typically. Take this cost and amortize it over your year's rent to see what it will cost you. If your absolute max budget is $1400 and you find a place for $1375 with a 15% fee, you can't afford it. 

There's no shortage of places without fees, and you should start looking for no-fee places first. Sometimes, if you see a building you're interested in living in, you can look it up online and call them directly to ask about vacancies. Dealing directly with a building is a lot more pleasant than brokers. 

* **Stuyvesant Town**

StuyTown is a common place to live for students moving out of the dorms. If you can get a couple roommates together (3 or more of you) it will be a great deal financially. Utilities are included and there are a lot of amenities. They have laundry in the building and public safety. The free NYU bus runs to StuyTown. 

They're really strict about late rent and you'll get hit hard with late fees, so get your rent in a couple days early if you live here. If you have fewer than 3 people, it doesn't make financial sense to live here compared to the dorms if you're trying to save money. Their online listings are never up to date, but if you go in to their offices and talk to them they're helpful. Overall, I like StuyTown because there's no broker's fee and it was a lot easier than my previous apartment searches.

* **How to deal with agents/brokers**

Do your research before going in. They're going to try and pressure you under the assumption that you're just a dumb kid that will sign anything. Always remember that you can walk away at any point. 

Understand that you need to give them slightly lower cost numbers than you actually have. If you say that your ideal price is $1500, they will have ""the perfect place"" for $1700. Know your true numbers, and keep them close to vest. They will tell you that ""you really can't find any apartments in your ideal price range"" which is nonsense. They say that to everyone regardless of your price range. 

You don't actually have to give them all of the private information that they ask for. They may ask for your family's tax returns, which could include your siblings' SSNs. They don't need that to determine whether you can afford a place. Take a black sharpie and redact information that's irrelevant and none of their business. They'll whine and get over it.

I said this in my last post, but avoid CitiHabitats like the plague. They'll scam you. They're known as ""ShittiHabitats"" for a reason.

Again, remember that you can always walk. They will tell you that they already have two applications in for this apartment, and that it will go quickly. They are often lying. Being efficient with your paperwork is good, but it's better to lose an apartment than be pressured into a bad one. 

They may try and imply that it's poor etiquette to use multiple brokers at once to look for a place. They are wrong. They will ask if you're looking around with anyone else, and your response should be ""I've seen a few places recently with other brokers, but I'm still looking and haven't found the right place yet."" Don't give any more detail. Competition lights a fire under them. It's the free market in action. Play hardball. 

* **Roommates**

Your best friend might not be the best person to live with. Some people are compatible in an apartment and some people are not. Pick roommates that, to the best of your knowledge, have similar attitudes and values about how the space will be used. You may love going out to the bars with your friend, but might not like the wild parties he throws at your apartments while you're trying to study. Do your best to get on the same page. 

Do not live with your significant other out of convenience or to save money- do it because you love each other and are ready for that stage in your relationship. I have known couples who moved in together out of financial interest, broke up, and had to continue living together in the same tiny apartment because they couldn't afford to break the lease and move out. That is some romantic-comedy level misery there. 

* **So, you've found the perfect place.**

Have your paperwork assembled early so that you're ready to move, but do so on your own terms- don't be pressured. Don't let your roommates get pressured and freaked out either, because then they will act irrationally. 

When it comes to the security deposit, divide it by the number of roommates and have everyone pay equally. Yes, I understand that you're living with your best friend since childhood and you've personally seen him put out a fire in a puppy orphanage using only his pectorals. It doesn't matter- you should all be on equal financial footing, so that everyone has an equal incentive not to damage the property. 

The same goes for **guarantors**, which are effectively a means of having your parents vouch for your ability to pay rent because you're a college student. You can have multiple guarantors. The real estate agent might say that ""they usually don't do things that way"" or ""it creates a lot of paperwork"", but make it happen anyways- you want to have as even of a distribution as possible of responsibility. Ideally, everyone's parents are guarantors, and everyone pays into the security deposit equally. Everyone has equal skin in the game, so no one has an incentive to break the lease or damage the property. This isn't because you don't trust them, but because everyone should be on equal footing. *""Trust, but verify.""* - Ronald Reagan

* **Payment**

You may have to pay using a method you're unfamiliar with. Get your mind out of the gutter, we're talking about certified checks and money orders. Certified checks come from your bank/credit union of choice, and are a means for a bank to say ""Yes, they actually have the money in the account, we promise."" Money orders are effectively like cash, and are a single nameless check with a dollar amount- you hand the bank cash, and they hand you a money order. Don't lose them, and treat them like cash. 

* **Notarization**

You might need to get something notarized at some point. This is a government-sanctioned way of saying ""Yeah, shit's official."" This is done through a notary public, who may charge you a nominal fee (something like $2) to notarize a document. They legally cannot charge you more than this nominal fee, so if someone says that it'll cost $20 to get something notarized they're trying to scam you. 

* **Final Thoughts**

Take a deep breath. You will be ok, and will find a good place to live. You will not end up in a cardboard box. Just spend a lot of time looking around, don't be afraid to say ""no"" or to play hardball, remember that you always have the dorms as a backup, keep away from the housing projects, and factor in the various costs listed above when figuring out what you can afford.

I'm Depressed about NYU,38,32,"&#x200B;

I am asking for advice from strangers on the internet.  I know it is not the best idea, but still want opinions. Here goes.

I am a sophomore who regrets coming to NYU. I got a big fat $0 from NYU, and while at the time I committed, I thought NYU would open all these doors, I realized that my major has a shortage, so any school would have done. I knew this when I committed, so can not really blame anyone, but NYU is so greedy, and I will be paying off this for ages. I do not know if I should transfer out or just stick it through. I am Mechanical Engineering at Tandon. I feel neglected and like I am just a number here.  I am also sick of being told, this is not avaiable here in Brooklyn, you need to go to the Manhattan Campus. Bookstore? Dining Hall? (not to go like Jasper, which is not a good value for money) One on one tutoring like the ARC in Manhattan?

Room Exchange,3,10,"Hey,so I posted on here previously about this situation.So as a junior I did not get to choose my room or get my desired roommate due to a bad selection time.Unfortunately I was placed with someone who I roomed with previously and it was not a good experience.I have met with my RHD,RA and contacted housing.I want to be moved to a single but that's unlikely and the only reason I don't want a double is because I could be with someome whose the same as my current roommate or worse.On top of that there are six people in total in the suite with one bathroom as well as barely any space in the kitchen cabinets.This whole situation is making it difficult for me to concentrate on my work and my family even suggested switching schools which as a Junior is not feasible.Does anyone here have any other ideas on what I should do?

Incoming freshman: don't sleep on Rubin hall! The doubles are straight 🔥 and cheap af,45,19,"I'm here to tell y'all about the most underestimated freshman dorm option available. To kick it off, here's a pic of my old double: 

[**Behold**](https://i.imgur.com/PVbzFGj.jpg)

That's not even all of it, next to my desk I had a fridge and a dresser. And behind that, a fucking *walk-in-closet*. You couldn't even fit a suitcase into half the closets in the other dorms. 

All this costs **$11,838 for the year**. The next closest double is **$14k**. You know that Weinstein hall people rave about? **$15k** for a double that's half the size of Rubin's and looks like a prison cell. [Check out the housing rates for yourself](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/resLifeHousServ/documents/ApplicationsandAssignments/Propposed2019-2020Rates.pdf).

Here's what else is dope about Rubin:

* Close to campus. Only Weinstein, Goddard, and Lipton are closer. Most people only get one chance to live within 10m from class, don't waste it. 

* Dope lounge. Rubin has the best lounge out of all the freshman dorms, period. It's huge and people are hanging out 24/7. 

* Great views (if you're lucky). 

* Classrooms downstairs mean you can roll out of bed and get to class in 2 minutes if the scheduling gods smile down on you.

* That 5th Ave address 

Now the bad shit: no AC. People really love to bitch and moan about this one because they're whiny freshman. It's only hot for the first and last couple weeks of the year, get a $20 fan and it'll be over before you know it. It makes you hang out in the air-conditioned lounge and make more friends than you know what to do with. Some even had a slumber party in one of the blacked-out theater rooms. You should only be going to your room to drink and sleep your first couple months anyways. 

I'm not saying you have to pick Rubin, just consider it when filling out your housing forms. You won't regret it.

Tandon to CAS?,2,10,"Hi Guys!!!

Just recently got accepted into NYU Tandon for BMS and I'm super excited! (esp. since its the only school other than my safeties that I was accepted to!- although UIUC Bio could still be an option)

I would really love to pursue biology in college, and biomedical engineering was what I was going for since I wanted to incorporate my other activities into my application. But truthfully I would be perfectly content studying either biology or bms.

Here's my dilemma. I've been doing more and more research on Tandon and I'm finding that its reputation isn't exactly great. It's separated from the rest of campus apparently (which I really don't like that i'm gonna have to commute a lot/feel isolated or alone), and its academics and faculty/facilities aren't up to par with the other NYU schools. These things are turn-offs for me.

Is it possible - and if it is - reccommended that I transfer into CAS to study neural science or bio? How difficult is that to do and what steps do I have to take? Please help me out because I was super excited to get in but now I feel that there's something missing.

ANY and ALL input/advice/insight (on NYU or Tandon specifically) is beyond welcome!!! Hopefully you guys have a lot to tell me!",b7fqi3,nyu
An Open Letter to NYU,65,16," 

To NYU:

New York University, NYU, the intellectual Mecca of Greenwich Village, the College Without Walls: thank you. Thank you for believing in the high-school junior from a town so small that, when asked where he was from, he’d simply say, “Massachusetts”; yet somehow people would still assume it was a city in Upper-State. An institution that receives hundreds of thousands of applications annually and had the gall to believe in the kid with a sob-story essay and an impressive ACT score, despite graduating 71st in his class, no doubt turning away hundreds of valedictorians in the same breath, deserves a “thank you.” Thank you, NYU, for allowing him the chance to break the cycle of poverty that had plagued his family since they were immigrant farmers in restless Vermont, and immigrant barbers in Western Massachusetts. Thank you for enticing him to accept your offer of admission with promises of guiding the first-generation students in navigating your bureaucracy. The aid package you offered wasn’t astonishing, in fact it was almost twenty times his expected family contribution; yet you provided access to loans that covered everything up front, coupled with grandiose visions of success after graduation. I am *sure* an institution as enriched as yourself was spread thin on allocating required aid to all the needy students you admit. Thank you for allowing him to grow in The Empire City in ways he could not have dreamt during his first semester. 

Yet all was not well with the new student. Despite his essay that detailed the uncertainty he’d faced his whole life, you could have not had *any idea* that he was slipping into the lowest of his depressive states with anxiety battering him at every turn. He may have reached out to his advisor and professors, but you heard none of it; it was never a worry until he became suicidal. Then, you suggested he take a medical leave. *Thank you* for offering that advice. *Thank you* for not burdening him with the nuances of credits attempted versus credits completed and the great deal of trouble it would cause him if he ever decided to return.

*Thank you* for allowing him to take a year-long hiatus to gather himself off your campus as you waited patiently, free from any liability he may have been. *Thank you* for allowing him to return to the city that once had once been home to so much turmoil in his life with open arms and contractual obligations that will regulate his future. Thank you for hosting the mentoring opportunity at your club fair that changed his life. Thank you for allowing him a second chance to flourish: gaining new friends, a job, and a deceitful sense of security. *Thank you* for holding him to a higher standard than his wealthier peers by stipulating his scholarship as a reward for the completion of a full semester; you put his place at the university into perspective. You never suspected he may face trouble adjusting back into university life despite knowing how long he had been away and the circumstances of the leave. *Thank you* for disciplining him by revoking his scholarship after one failed class in his first semester back; *thank you* for overlooking his 3.2 GPA in the other three classes he completed. *Thank you* for revoking this opportunity on one professor’s judgement of his aptitudes in Classical Literature.  *Thank you* for sending him back to that small town that nobody has heard of where he works nights in a warehouse to pay for community college. *Thank you* for $30,000 in student loans he must repay. *Thank you* for sending the $750 housing cancellation fee to his house, since he was not able to be in New York City any longer to pick it up himself.  

Thank you, NYU, for teaching him that achieving his dreams does not depend on an institution’s faith in him but on his faith in himself. You have taught him to not take his blessings for granted but rather to chase any and all opportunities presented with full force. *Thank you* for testing his determination with more trials and tribulations - as if he has not faced more than his share already. You have proven that earning stability through education while overcoming poverty, mental health issues, and a lack of institutional familiarity as a first-generation college student would be a formidable challenge. Thank you, NYU, for showing your true colors regarding your commitments to student success. You have taught this young student plenty on the harsh realities of being but a number in a system, and nothing more. Thank you, New York University.

Sincerely,

N10598883",9yfrmn,nyu
"As an enrolled grad student this upcoming Fall with a somewhat limited budget, where do you suggest looking for an apartment in/around the City?",1,3,I have various friends and acquaintances already living in NYC but if moving in with one of them falls through I'd like to know which areas to search for the most economic housing (I know it may be an impossible task). It does not matter to me to live in Manhattan/Brooklyn/in the Jersey metropolitan area as long as the commute to NYU's campus is an hour or less. Thanks in advance for any advice from a neophyte trying to find his way around the Big Apple.,8ll4nc,nyu
"NYU Getting Started Guide: Tips, Tricks, and Advice",127,18,"Sup freshies...hope you're ready for welcome week! Here's some stuff I'd like to share with you that I hope will help make your NYU experience even better. In very deliberate order, here goes:

---
# Realize everybody is as nervous as you
Everybody just started a new chapter of their lives with zero or few friends still around. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there—approach groups, strike up conversations, initiate plans...NYU can be unforgiving to introverted people but you gotta push through any inhibitions you might have. You might not stay friends with any of the people you met during welcome week, but by hanging out with them anyways you have a much better chance of finding people you click with. Don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself or coming off weird—everybody is too busy adjusting to their new environment to care.

#Download [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/)
The subway map looks like a plate of spaghetti and there's always some kind of service change going on. This app handles it like a champ, never use anything else if you're relying on the MTA. **Seriously.**

---
# Get MS Office for Free
Please don't spend money on Microsoft Office. Create an account with your NYU email [here](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) and once you sign in, look for [this](https://i.imgur.com/5nLjxDL.png) button to download office for free.

# Create an NYU alias email address

The ""abc123@nyu.edu"" address you got is ugly. Go to [home.nyu.edu](https://home.nyu.edu) and make your own custom address. (I recommend ""first.last@nyu.edu""). To find the setting: click on your name on the top corner > settings > email preferences.

---
# Stop paying so much for books
Seriously. Wait a couple class periods to see if you *really* need your textbooks. If you do, check out libgen [dot] io (that's a URL) and search by ISBN or title. I've saved literally hundreds of dollars, this past year I got lucky and spent only $8 total on textbooks.

---
# Apply for a credit card
It's important to build credit. Having a 4-year old account with on-time payments in your name when you graduate will help a lot. Just please don't get in debt with the thing. Fiscal responsibility and all that stuff...

---
# Get an [EasyPay metrocard](https://www.easypaymetrocard.com/vector/forte/cgi_bin/forteisapi.dll?ServiceName=ETCAccountWebSO&TemplateName=miscellaneous/PreFundedAccount.html)
Don't be the guy/girl who always has to refill their metrocard when you're already half an hour late to the party. Just don't lose it or else you're paying for someone else's rides.

If you don't want to go that route, **$20.95** (+$1 for a new card) is the magic number to refill your metrocard with for exactly 8 rides with no balance left over.

---
That was the meat of it. Here's some more minor stuff that comes to mind:

* The Staples on Broadway price-matches Amazon
* Boba Guys are the best Boba near campus. Don't @ me.
* Don't buy drugs from anyone in the park
* Titos and Stoli are the best cheap vodkas. Don't get the plastic-handle stuff.
* The RA's are students too, try to be their friend as they can have a lot to teach you. Don't try to BS them either, they were freshmen too. 
* Don't be afraid to check out the other boroughs. They can be cheaper and more lively than Manhattan. 

Good luck!",9aac3j,nyu
Tandon Issues,0,7,"I feel like NYU has misled me and, judging by this subs other posts, a lot of people about Tandon. 

I see how many events are at WSP compared to Tandon. There's so many fun events, free food, and other cool things going on there. They do not put much effort into student life here at Tandon. Want to go to an event? Too bad! the shuttle is delayed and you either have to take the subway or just not go, You probably will miss class otherwise.

&#x200B;

LACK OF INTERACTION WITH NYU MANHATTAN

There is not enough cross pollination with other schools. I wanted to meet people from other schools, isn't that what college is all about. All I see are people who can either barely speak english, hate writing and can't hold a conversation here.  I came here to meet people from all majors, but Tandon's isolation hurts us. But seriously, can't you get a TA who can speak English, and not Hindi or Mandarin??? (IK, not nice, but off my chest.)

TUITION HIKES WHILE ADMINISTRATION LIVES IN LUXURY

Financial Aid sucks, and even if your situation changes, they do not give  jack shit. And the Brooklyn student link center is staffed with the most miserable people here. I feel if you are not a certain race (mainly black or hispanic) or a woman or from a certain area, you are not valuable to them. All in the name of 'diversity"". It is insulting to them because it discounts their merit due to everyone assuming they got in due to affirmative action, which I know some only got in because of that. I have compared grades. It is unfair and disgusting. NYU just wants your money. 

&#x200B;

HIGH CRIME

I just saw a robbery on the subway yesterday, and without fail, see at least three people hop on my way home every night. And don't get me started on the homeless  (and insane people) in this area. We are right next to the projects BTW.

Know a guy who was jumped by some thugs by Willoughby, just a block away. And how about the shooting by shakeshack?

&#x200B;

NYU should charge less for Tandon tuition, perhaps $5-10,000 less, because we are missing out on so much that the Manhattan Campus offers. We are not separate but equal. Maybe President Hamilton could use part of his 1.2 million salary or rent out his $35,000 a month penthouse to help cover the difference?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Tandon fucking sucks, and you should not come here unless you are prepared to be isolated from the real NYU.
