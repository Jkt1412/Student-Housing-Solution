‚ÄúI see that they‚Äôve blocked off the corner of Daniel and Sixth Street with fencing. Will they finally be demolishing those buildings? Has the city announced what will be built there?

The developer, said Champaign Planning and Development Director Bruce Knight, is Core Spaces, based in Chicago.

The company‚Äôs website describes the property as The James and describes it as a nearly 350,000 square foot development with more than 20,000 square feet of retail.It will have 322 housing units with 658 beds. It appears to be 16 or 17 stories high.

Where to go/who to see on campus when you can't get your programming environment to work?,6,14,"I often find myself having issues with getting python/C++/java/etc.  languages to download to my computer and I have issues with downloading their libraries/modules.   For some reason, I have terrible luck with this stuff, and when everyone else is able to get everything to run with something like ""pip3 install pytorch"", I have to waste hours (sometimes days) debugging and trying to figure it out.   And I know these are supposed to be ""one time things"", but I've had bad luck and I had to reinstall windows twice this year (windows corrupted update the first time, hard drive broke the second time).

It's awful, and stackoverflow often doesn't have a working solution to my problem.

Office hours doesn't really help much either, as usually there are many students with ""real questions"", or the TA/CA tells me to use google.

Sure, fine, I suppose it isn't their job to debug my installation.....

But if I \*truly\* cannot things to work on my lapp, whose job is it?  Because I'm at a brick wall if nobody else is able to intervene.  If I can't test my code on my computer, then I can't do my assignments.I'd pay som\*efkguone if I could, but people in CS usually value time over \[small\] sums of money.

Would it be like that tech services place in Siebel? Or that other one in DCL? Or is it actually the job of a TA/CA to help me get things working? If none of those, is there some third party place I can get things taken care of?

EDIT: I truly hate the useless mf who are commenting on this post to just ""figure it out myself"" and ""look at stack overflow"".  Your comments are less than useless. They are a waste of time to you and me and they piss me off extraordinarily. Read the damn post, the premise of this question is ""who can I go to when googling things doesn't work?""  Quit responding with ""I usually read carefully and use google.""  You're completely ignoring the question.

EDIT 2: for reasons I can't explain, it works now. i didn't even reboot my computer since last night, so I'm saying this is witchcraft üòµ.     however, for future students reference and for my own, please lmw of any resources you can think of.",dy7gkj,UIUC

How to buses affect the issue of students having trouble making friends on campus? Idle thoughts.,0,9,"Did students attending prior to the current bus service have greater opportunity to meet or walk and talk as they moved about campus. Do students riding buses today engage in social interactions to the degree those who walk do (or did in the past)? Do the jump on - and then jump off a few blocks later - ride styles one often sees on campus allow for the kinds of interactions once more common among students?

Bus service on campus as we know it started to develop in the late 1980‚Äôs but it took years to reach the density and frequency in place today. Prior to this students would walk (though certainly some biked) back to dorms for lunch and again for supper in the evening. They rarely rode a bus between classes as few city buses ran optimized routes for such movement. Campus was not too much bigger then. North of Springfield there were already a few academic buildings and the south quad was starting to fill out south of Mumford. Dorms were where they are now.

Don't counterprotest the Ann Coulter event on campus,257,55,"Hear me out. I'm a leftist and I don't care for these chuds coming to our campus but we need to learn from what happened when Milo came to our campus and we need to try something different. Personally I reccommend that we ignore them, sending the message that they are irrelevant to us and that we are not going to play into their hands. Going back to what happened in the aftermath of the Milo event, the protest only gave him more publicity, he became more popular , sold more books and made more money. The last thing Ann Coulter needs is our attention, because ultimately a protest at Berkeley is publicity for her and it's exactly what she wants and that is exactly why we shouldn't do it. As for the more alt-right elements of their movement who are bound to show up, they too want us to show up and pick a fight with them. We should not give them the fight they are looking for, it only helps their cause because when they get hurt they get to play the victim. No one wants to punch a nazi more than I do but please believe me when I say it is not good optics for the left. The country at large does not view our violence the same way that they view the violence from the right, the playing field is unequal and the game is rigged against us. Their movement, (the alt-right) like the rest of the country, is predominantly white. When images of injured and bloodied white boys circulate in the media, the people who view these images do not react rationally, they react emotionally: what they see is not a 'nazi' being hurt for being a Nazi, what they see is a white person being hurt for being white. The alt-right knows this and it is exactly what they want to happen so they can push their white victim narrative. 

So please, it is my belief that the best thing we can do is ignore them. No one needs to get hurt or go to jail or die over this. The world doesn't need another Heather Heyer tragedy to happen. They can't hurt anyone if nobody shows up. In all likelihood if they don't have anyone to taunt or goad into a fight then they will get bored and go home. If you are going to protest the event, please please please just keep it non violent and remember that the whole country is watching us. If we repeat the events of the Milo debacle we are only going to produce more bad optics for the University and for the Left. 

Let's try something different this time, lets give them what they really deserve: to be ignored.

Best places to cry on campus,273,24,"I thought this list would be useful, especially during midterm season. Here are my favorite places to cry on campus. 

Outside of Soda (next to Cafe VA). Everyone usually minds their own business because they're busy doing work. Also, it's usually a little bit sunny which makes the situation better. If you're crying you might as well be in a nice environment with some plants around you.

Benches near strawberry creek. I've found that nobody is ever in the naturey part of campus, so it's really nice to just sit on the benches and look at the creek and trees and cry to yourself as much as you need, and nobody will bother you. 

Single bathrooms in Dwinelle Hall. These are conveniently located right outside lecture halls just in case you need to excuse yourself for a good cry. 

**Hot takes**:

During a midterm or exam. This is controversial, but nothing beats just silently letting tears run down your face during the exam where everyone else is focused on their own work. Bonus points if a TA makes eye contact with you while you cry.

Cory bathrooms. Listen...I know it's grimy. But nobody's ever in there because it smells awful, and you can't smell how bad it is if your nose is stuffy enough from crying.

Feel free to add your own recommendations!",dfnm8k,berkeley

Best places on campus to sleep with your professor,78,4,"Right around October/November is about when I'm usually a month or so behind on lectures with no real hope of ever catching back up. With finals on the way, and as existential dread slowly replaces sanity, time is running out to establish a proper relationship with your professors.

This is how I did it back when I attended Berkeley. Perhaps my list will be of use to some of you. **GO BEARS!**

1. Under the bridge outside Dwinelle. No one ever checks this place except homeless people doing drugs. And chances are some of the homeless will have viagra (make sure it's viagra). This place is extra convenient because it's right outside tons of classrooms, so you can convert on your grades in record time. 

2. Wheeler bathrooms top level. No one ever goes here because of how inconvenient these bathrooms are to get to. Not even the homeless. This means you have full privacy, but the clear and obvious downside being of course a severe lack of viagra from nearby homeless folk. You'll have to make do in other ways.

3. A bit of a hot take, but right in the middle of class. This may backfire if your professor is seeing another student, creating an immediate turf war assuming your professor is one of low libido. But a benefit not found with other methods is that, if you were to court successfully, no other student would dare approach that same professor due to pack mentality kicking in. Extremely valuable if the class is curved. 

You may also use these methods to sleep with your GSIs if you're truly desperate.

**Edit:** Forgot to mention an important caveat. These methods will not work on Professor Hilfinger because of how many students are already doing his finger exercises.",dfsx90,berkeley

Old Man on Campus - Greetings from a 2003 Drop-Out who's Re-Enrolled this Spring to Graduate in Aug 2019.,152,36,"Greetings fellow Golden Bears!

Ever since I left Cal in 2003, the joke among my Cal friends who actually graduated on time was that I could start the ""Hey Alumni!"" chants whenever we were watching the game at one of the SoCal alumni HQ bars like Busby's in Santa Monica. In my enthusiasm to be returning to complete my undergraduate studies, I felt moved to say hello to my fellow ursine redditors and share my delight in having rejoined this amazing student body. 

To a person (even those who mistake me for a GSI or professor :) ) every one of y'all IRL have been super nice, and in study questions, enthusiastically helpful. It's amazingly refreshing to encounter such kind, intimidatingly smart, and wise-beyond-their-years normal-aged undergrads. 

I've got a whole world built in soCal I'll be returning to after graduation, but for the next 8 months Cal is my home, and there's a certain sitcom quality to being back in a double in Unit 2 with suitemates half my age. Anyway, I just wanted to properly check in with Cal's Reddit community, and say hello. Reddit-wise, I've been participating since 2010, and while I haven't started any legendary memes or anything, I am particularly proud of being a part of the /r/changemyview mod team, where my main contribution is as host of the [CMV podcast](https://changemyview.net/podcast](https://changemyview.net/podcast/).

I don't have any other real purpose to be posting here other than to say, if you think my strange position as a 38-year-old undergrad might lend some perspective or wisdom on a question or whatever, or think my own challenges in 2003 might relate to a tough semester you might be having, I'd be happy to listen. Also, I've spent the better part of my time away [working in new media startups in Santa Monica](www.linkedin.com/in/mehatch), so any Hollywood, operations, SEO, or start-up type Q's I might be able to offer some advice on, fire away.

Other than that, anyone who wants to talk class, I'm in PS144, PS124, and most brutally, Math1A, which is why for the most part if I'm not in class, I'm at the [SLC](https://slc.berkeley.edu) trying to get the maths parts of my brain to kick off the dust and re-animate like some cursed old Egyptian mummies.

"""Christian"" Cult on Campus (Reconnect)",54,5,"Throwaway account for anonymity.

&#x200B;

Berkeley is a satellite location for a ""Christian"" cult. This South Korean cult, Shinchonji, has people on campus (usually around Sproul and Moffitt) trying to recruit people to join their small group Bible studies that then transition to a larger Bible study class. They act ""Christian,"" asking to take spiritual surveys on campus. One similar trend is that when asked what church they belong to, they're hesitant to share or they make up a name (if you Google the name of the church they say, you won't find a legit website). Some fake names they've gone under include ""Reconnect,"" ""True Vine,"" and ""Zion"". They're the same group as this one mentioned on this reddit post: [redd.it/7chpu2](https://redd.it/7chpu2)

&#x200B;

Based on passion/zeal/knowledge of Bible verses alone, they seem like a very devout Christian group. They do so to target Christians specifically because they believe deception is ok if for achieving their end goal.

&#x200B;

As stated in the linked post above:

From the 2012 post: ""This group tricks Christians into participation by withholding information, lures them in through starting with non-controversial lessons, building seemingly caring relationships, and using guilt as a weapon. Early lessons are about the importance of Biblical knowledge and how the Pharisee‚Äôs lack of knowledge caused them to reject Jesus when he was right in front of them. This lays a groundwork that dupes participants into buying the more extreme ideas taught in later lessons. Those that see it for what it really is and call it a cult are compared to the Pharisees that rejected Jesus.""

From the 2017 post: ""In that post, OP talks about the small group transitioning into a class, which is the next step in the brainwashing/grooming/conversion process. It's the same in my experience. Without warning, our small group leader told us we would transition into a class during winter quarter. They gave us very little information about this so-called theology class, yet a bunch of us blindly filled out applications for it anyway.""

&#x200B;

Their teachings begin as a very deep study of the Bible, however, it then turns to a close study of words where they begin to redefine words in the Bible. At first, it seems harmless since they use verses from the Bible. However, they later start taking verses out of context as they start gaining your trust that they're good and Biblical teachers. Built up over time, their teachings begin to turn heretical as they get you to mindlessly follow their underlying agenda.

&#x200B;

A simple google search of ""Scj cult"" will reveal their true beliefs which mostly centers around worshiping the founder, Lee Man-hee. Beware, it seems they're growing relatively fast.

I emailed Parking because all that is left is maybe 30ish lots behind the Benson. Lot 70 is never coming back and is apparently going to BE the Moody Center. I'm just frustrated because this construction was obviously planned long in advance, but those of us who purchased a C permit were never told of the large changes when we bought them.

For what it's worth, apparently there are enough spots in the Longhorn Lots to make up for the loss of Lot 70. And then you can either wait for a bus or take your chances crossing the frontage roads.",e26e4v,UTAustin

Looking to start a new martial arts club on campus,7,0,"Hi all, I know it's a little late in the semester, but I'm looking to put together a new organization based around the practice of Historical European Martial Arts (or HEMA for short), and to hopefully get it approved by the end of the semester to have it all set for the spring. It will be more of a free form learn-what-you-want study group than a teacher/student setting once everyone is caught up on basics.

I of course want to emphasize that safety will absolutely be the number one priority, and that we will use dulled, training weapons only along with modern protective wear designed specifically for this practice. I've been learning safely and without injury for over three years from qualified instructors affiliated with the HEMA Alliance.

HEMA is essentially the practice of both armed and unarmed martial techniques from the late medieval period through the Renaissance. Some of the more common areas of focus include longsword, sword and buckler, sidesword, sabre, and other weapons of which surviving instructional manuscripts exist. The basis of the art comes from these surviving texts, written by masters from the time. I'm basically trying to say it's the actual way you're supposed to fight with Medieval swords coupled with practical self defense techniques. 

It's fun, it's good exercise, and the gear makes it safe.

Confused about the on-campus protest today? [Hong Kong],169,85,"If you were confused about the on-campus protest today: **we were protesting in support of** [**Hong Kong's democracy protests**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests#Suicides)**.**

**Thank you to everyone who came out** to the [917 - Support Hong Kong Democracy protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/d54gg6/waterloo_protest_to_support_hong_kong_tomorrow/) at UW today!!!

# The organizers estimate that a total of [50+9\* people](https://twitter.com/hkwaterloo/status/1174166904891727872) participated in our protest today!!

\*The [\+9 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests#Suicides) are to represent the 9 Hong Kong protesters who have lost their life in this movement (so far, 8 are confirmed, with a 9th to be confirmed).

**Some quick facts:**

* Our **purpose** was to show the **Waterloo community's support for Hong Kong, as they battle for** [**democracy, freedom, and human rights**](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions), and to **SAY NO to** [**continued police brutality**](https://time.com/5666181/hong-kong-protests-police-subway-batons/) **in Hong Kong.**
* Hong Kongers have 5 demands, all surrounding democracy, freedom, human rights, anti police brutality, and not being arbitrarily detained by Mainland Chinese authorities.
* There were roughly 10-15 hecklers and onlookers who held opposing views.
* Here's a [full live stream](https://twitter.com/hkwaterloo/status/1174029540902883328?s=21) of the protests.

**How can I get involved and support HK?**

* Follow our Social Media accounts: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hkwaterloo), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fXB94nC1l/), [Telegram](https://t.me/SingHalluejlahtoHongKong) group. Stay tuned, as we will have more actions in Waterloo in the future.
* Do all the steps in this guide - particularly ""[How can Canadians help HK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U7C-EMjMc76l5VRydu0Hw7Ms0ce2Gc_rpOK3N9fCwD8/edit)?"" section
* Read about HK from these news sites: [Hong Kong Free Press](https://www.hongkongfp.com/) (EN), [The Stand News](https://thestandnews.com/) (Chinese), [Hong Kong Citizen News](https://www.hkcnews.com) (Chinese)
* Keep telling your friends and family about Hong Kong. International spotlight definitely helps; the Chinese government keeps trying to improve its image amongst the West with initiatives like [The Confucius Institute (right here at Waterloo)](https://uwaterloo.ca/community-and-professional-education/confucius-institute) and [Panda Diplomacy in Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/giant-panda-cubs-politics-economics-conservation-toronto-zoo-1.3481839) and hide its authoritarian, oppressive nature, but if we read about HK and keep up international pressure, they will think twice before continuing to suppress freedoms.

Strange coughing fits in a computer lab on campus,43,13,"I'm not going to go into many details here, such that I can keep this post as anonymous as possible. I like to do work in campus computer labs during quieter hours at the school since I find it easier to focus. There are lots of labs, and there aren't many people around at night, so I will usually listen outside of a lab for a minute to try to figure out if anyone is inside. If so, I will go to another lab. This incident has happened twice to me now, at the same computer lab. I was with a group of people the first time, but this most recent time, I was alone.

I heard no noise from inside the room when I listened at the door. I went inside and was surprised to see someone in the lab. This wasn't a big deal, since they were obviously being quiet. However, a few seconds after I walked into the room, they began to aggressively cough over and over as if they couldn't catch their breath. I wasn't sure what to do, so I just sat at a computer and logged in. After a minute of the coughing, they got up and left the room, slamming the door on their way out. They left all of their stuff inside the room (some food, a drink, maybe a bag on the floor where I couldn't see it). I stayed for a few minutes, but since I was alone and it was nighttime, I got a bit nervous. I logged off and left the lab. 

The first time this happened, my friends and I stayed for an hour or so before leaving, and this person never returned. This time when I left, I saw they were waiting outside in the hallway, still coughing slightly. I walked away without saying anything.

I am making this post because I'm confused about what is happening here, and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced something similar or could shed some light on the situation. Thanks.",ddh4eo,uwaterloo

The elephant on campus,10,57,"I told myself I wasn't going to do this, because I didn't wanna add fuel to the fire. But here I go.

I've seen a lot of dialogue on the ""UW is a trap"" video and I have some thoughts. 

As someone in the Faculty of Environment, I feel as though my experience at uni has been much different than that of a traditional STEM student or even an Arts student. I don't have the unhealthy sense of competitiveness that I see in a lot of students in other faculties. Also, I don't think many people know students from my faculty, and there isn't a stigma around the Faculty of Environment like there is with Arts. 

I can't help but think that a large reason as to why this has become a meme is that this girl is in the Arts faculty. Her experiences are not ""valid"" enough for many of you because you look down upon her to begin with. You have virtually no sympathy for her because your programs have made you prone to ridiculing anyone that shows a sign of weakness. This is the true problem with Waterloo. 

I will admit, her video was impulsive and it was clear to me that she did it out of the heat of the moment. We all do and say things in a reactionary way, but she decided to put it on YouTube. Live and learn. 

What troubles me about this issue are peoples' response. I'm sure a lot of you are not in school right now, but quite a few of us are in we're in the thick of exam season. To constantly poke and prod at this girl for expressing her concerns in a state of vulnerability is such a pathetic use of time and it's laughable at how little empathy people have. Making a transcript and posting it on reddit is so beyond douchey and is a true testament to the culture surrouding UW. **You all act like you are sad when someone does take their life due to school, but when someone makes themselves vulnerable to the world, you shit on them.** 

Look, I didn't agree with everything she said. I did agree with some points, like the fact that *the academic advisors here are ass.* My point is that while you can agree or disagree with her synopsis of the situation, getting into this mob mentality to try and crush her and anyone that has a grievance against UW is weak and perfectly exemplifies the toxic culture UW students exemplify. 

To the girl who made the video, I can't say I agreed with everything you said, but the treatment you have received in wake of posting the video has made me so unbelievably annoyed with the UW student body. I hope this hasn't completely soured your experience at UW, because there are great things about it. Best of luck in Toronto.",coe90j,uwaterloo

* Save money  (residence was dumb expensive for the bare minimum amenities tbh)
* Teach first-years how to cook and grocery shop in a cost-effective manner (cause meal plan was expensive and bland as hell)
* Can learn how to take the bus and utilize off-campus resources (I barely used the bus when I was in first year)
* Help develop a sense of responsibility/independence rather than having to abide by UW's rules (On-campus residence rules felt a bit restrictive cause too many things are a liability issue nowadays).
* You could probably decrease the number of times you have to evacuate your place by 50% because of false fire alarms.
* Escape the gloomy and somewhat depressive UW atmosphere  (especially during exam times)

The only things I see going for on-campus housing is:

* Meeting people in your program and making friends, in general, could be easier (however, this could easily be done if you live off-campus and are a social person or met people from the UW first-year facebook pages)
* Being in close vicinity to campus (unless you live in REV or something lol)
* You are bound to an 8-month lease which is especially good if you are a CS/Eng student and have a 1B co-op. (But, you can also find 8-month leases on UW housing FB pages)

What about you? Are you happy you lived on-campus for your first year?  What was your experience like?

Racist Remark on Campus?,48,26,"So I'm a Junior in this organization called SAIL and I'm on the staff team that helps run the organization. Today we were having a campus outreach event passing out valentine memes and chocolate to other students. After we were done we were just chilling near the MSC  talking and enjoying the weather. I'm writing this literally 15 minutes after this situation happened because it was such a shock. Pretty much, these old men came up to our group and asked one of my sophomores if I was a RA on campus.( Just to be clear I'm like one of the only black people in this organization.) My sophomore replied saying I was just a counselor for the organization. This old dude proceeded to walk closer to me and say ""Once you go white you never go back"" like it was supposed to be a joke. When he said that, everyone was just awkwardly looking at each other not knowing what to say. The whole time I just had an awkward smile on because I didn't know what to say. He then told one of my other sophomores ""haha he doesn't get it"". One of the sophomores he told that to said "" I don't get it either"". After that the old dude and his buddy just walked away. We weren't sure how to put that whole situation, but that fuck ass dude is definitely a racist. 

&#x200B;

I love this campus with all my heart, but I won't tolerate the exposure to racism not one bit. It's disgusting and doesn't deserve any space at A&M at all. I hope anyone reading this can use what I wrote as something inspiring, because that one comment that man made was sad and not a representation of A&M core values.

After a bunch of work (over *17* months, Whoop!) I am happy to announce Aggie Routes 2.0

On the site, you can find the fastest bus route to get between any Texas A&M - College Station Bus Stops or Buildings. You'll also be able to see the estimated bus travel times, biking times, and walking times. There's also a map that outlines the custom bus route that you need to take (say for example, you need to switch bus routes, the map will show the path you will need to travel).

I'd love if you could try it out and give feedback, and if you like it, please share :)

The man introduced himself as someone who was running a small speaker event at tech for business students and asked for my contact info to further discuss a potential opportunity. I, internship hungry/desperate, decided to give it a shot.

Come this morning, I'm supposed to meet him and I wake up half an hour late. I call him and apologize and he says make it over to culc anyways. First alarm bell. But I still get dressed and head there and start talking to him. He begins talking about networks and how we make these social networks and yet don't get compensated  for them. HE follows up by talking about how this school teaches you to take a safe career and work a good paying job but you'd be working for someone else. He then asks me to imagine what I would  do in 5 years if I made 100k and had the time to do whatever I wanted. Second alarm bell, this is beginning to sound like a crappy internet scam right? Well, during the course of the conversation he brings up that he wants my parents in the loop because this being an entrepreneurial opportunity and all, there might be some licensing costs or whatnot.

To the protestors on campus today:,48,3,"This is not the right way to go about changing people's minds.

With all the respect in the world for the freedom of speech and the voicing of opinions--no matter how controversial they may be--if your goal was to get people to better understand your position and perhaps even sway them onto your side, then you have done an objectively poor job.

If your goal was simply to upset a student population and cause outrage, then I commend you; for, there was an air of negativity and hostility on campus today that I have not experienced in quite a while. You definitely made your point and dampened the spirits of many a passerby student.

If your intention was in fact to change the minds of a largely pro-choice student population and convince them to adopt a pro-life perspective or even to be more understanding of your position, then let me first explain to you why you have failed, and offer some advice for how to cultivate more productive discourse that does not result in hostility or anger:

First, by displaying posters in the center of campus including a large projector showing footage of abortions, you have made engagement in this conversation virtually unavoidable, including to those that did not want to be involved in it in the first place.

Next, seeing these graphic images triggers an emotional response in many people that makes it highly unlikely for them to separate feelings from rationality, which is not conducive to a productive conversation.

Finally, when faced with media that aggressively supports a message that appears antithetical to their beliefs, the vast majority of people are likely to feel antagonized, which results in them doubling down on their position, not wanting to engage in any sort of conversation, and feeling justified in retaliating against the party they feel is attacking them.

Obviously, none of the above is good for civil discourse or productive debate. Instead, may I recommend the following:

1. Take a note from the groups on the Skiles walkway. Instead of utilizing imagery for shock value, politely ask people to engage in the conversation by handing out flyers or holding a poll. This way, those that do not want to participate in the conversation are not forced to.
2. Share your point of view, but be prepared to listen to others' as well. You cannot expect to convince others of your position if you are not open to also understanding the positions of others. Present facts and statistics, but keep debate civil. Unchecked emotion has ruined many a good debate.
3. Be human. It is easy to forget that behind the disturbing images and shock-value media are real human people that hold real opinions. If you decide you want to openly display an opinion, have the courage to stand there and defend it instead of hiding behind posters and video projectors. If you want to change people's minds, you can't be afraid to actually *engage* in debate.

I sincerely hope that you find this post helpful and reconsider the methods with which you aim to change people's minds.",drqi59,gatech

"The ""Visiting every building on campus"" challenge.",79,28,"Greetings /r/gatech,

I'm a [bored](https://xkcd.com/267/) CS student, and I like to explore. I also want to meet new people outside my major. It seems a little sad that even though I've been here for a year already I've only really been to a few places on campus. While my life is centered around Klaus and CCB, I've never been in any of the bio quad buildings, for example!

Therefore, I decided to make it a challenge to visit every building on campus at least once before I graduate. But I also think it's not very interesting if I simply just go to a building and walk around aimlessly. So it would be better if I had someone who was familiar with the place to show me around and point out anything interesting or cool that people outside your major might not be aware of. It also seems like a fun way to learn and share what cool stuff we have on campus that not many people know about.

That's where you can help! If you're a different major, I would love to meet up sometime, hang out, and explore any of the places that you go every day. The places that are mundane to you are new and exciting to me! If I piqued your interest, please send me a PM. Or send it to your friends. Thanks for reading my post! :D

**List of places I'm already familiar with**:

* Klaus
* CCB
* CODA
* The Hive / IDC

**Cool-looking places I want to see:**

* [~~Nanotechnology building~~](https://cleanroom.gatech.edu/content/Capabilities) ~~(isn't there like a die fab here?!?!?!)~~ Visited!! And there *IS* really cool equipment!
* Petit building (What's with the clean room in the basement!!!)
* Caddell building (it looks cool from the outside. but I don't know what they do)
* Bio Quad: Petit biotech, Whitaker, Ford, Molecular Sci.&Eng. (these buildings look super fancy, I wonder what cool stuff is inside.)
* Krone (This building has really cool architecture and I keep seeing busy-looking grad students come out of here. But I don't know what it is they research)
* [Manufacturing quad](https://mill.mse.gatech.edu/): Love, Manufacturing research center, Manufacturing complex (there's an electron microscope!!!!)
* ~~Architecture (there's pretty art inside.)~~ Saw it!! And learned about their major.
* Scheller (looks really fancy)
* ~~Howey, Mason (maybe cool physics stuff here?)~~ Visited! Saw Jupiter and Saturn through the telescope for the first time in my life :)
* Skiles (I've been here, but surely a math major knows more than me.)
* Coon, Weber (Maybe cool space stuff here??)
* Guggenheim, Knight, and Eng Sci & Mech. (Maybe cool aerospace or ME stuff here?)
* Van Leer (Isn't there a huge radio tower on the roof?)
* Boggs, Burger-Henry and Allen, Cherry Emerson, Savant, Swann (I keep walking past these places but don't know what they even are for)
* Anywhere else you think is interesting! Your dorm, your fraternity, your research lab, where you work, etc!

Edit: wow, I didn't expect to get such a positive response. People already messaged me about Howey and Marcus. Would love to see more!

I didnt know if I should post this, because the last thing I want is for them to be hurt. However, I did want to warn people that this adult cat has at least one kitten, so please be careful around it. Certainly dont take it away without also caring for the kitten.

Clery Act Safety Alert
On Campus Robberies
 
Incident Date/Time: August 28, 2019, at approximately 6:11 p.m. and 6:30 p.m

Incident Location 1:  Atlantic Drive NW at Tenth Street NW
Incident Location 2:  State Street NW between Ferst Drive NW and Tenth Street NW

Incident Description:  The victim in incident 1 was walking on Tenth Street NW at the intersection of Atlantic Drive NW when a vehicle pulled up next to him.  Suspect 1 got out of the car, snatched the cell phone out of his hand, and then got back in the car, which drove away.

The victim in incident 2 stated he was walking on State Street NW between Ferst Drive NW and Tenth State NW when suspect 2 ran up behind him, snatched the cell phone out of his hand, then continued running towards Tenth Street NW, where he got into a vehicle and drove away.

GTPD officers located the vehicle in the Home Park neighborhood and gave chase but were forced to call off the chase due to the reckless driving of the suspects and the danger to pedestrians and other drivers.

Both victims are students at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Description of Suspects
1: Black male wearing white hooded sweatshirt
2. Black male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt
Investigation indicates there were at least three people in the suspect vehicle

TNR on campus,20,2,"Hi there! 

I'm a fourth-year LMC who tends to stay on campus late during the week. Because of this, I see plenty of cats on my walk to my car in the wee hours of the morning. 

I've noticed that someone has been feeding these cats at the Student Center parking deck, but none of the cats seem to have ear tips. I was wondering if there are currently any student-led initiatives for TNR-ing this seemingly growing colony? I emailed facilities and they told me to post here to ask.

I have access to traps and a contact at a local nonprofit who does TNR procedures (the whole nine yards -- rabies, FLV, FIV, altering, and chipping if necessary) and I believe some of the kittens are still in that good good age gap to be socialized and adopted. 

So, is anyone already working on this? Can I join in? Or is anyone interested in helping me get this show on the road? I want these cats to live long, happy lives (safe against those rabid foxes and safe against unnecessary breeding!). 

I have included a pic of my personal favorite kitty for attention.

OMSCS vs traditional on campus CS if not working and studying at same time.,11,4,"Hi all,

I'm currently 2 years out of undergrad working at a backend API software developer job, and I'm very certain at this point that I'd want to transition to ML/AI, as those were the classes I did best (and my favorites by far) back in undergrad. I want to transition into this field as quickly as possible, and I have enough funds saved up such that I can study for my MS for 2 years without a job. AFAIK, it seems like the 2 main advantages of full time are that you can take enough classes to be ""full-time"" (4 classes) and graduate in 3 semesters, and getting an F1 visa for internationals, but as I'm American, the second one doesn't apply. But even as an OMSCS, I can take 2 classes at once during first two semesters then I can apply to take 3 classes at once for my last two semesters, so I'd still graduate in  2 years which would be reasonable. Also, even as OMSCS, I can live near campus, get a student ID, use the library, and interact with my full time peers if I so choose. I also know that oncampus course offerings are more, but I find that alone to hardly justify the 10x tuition increase from OMSCS. Can anyone explain if there are any more advantages for on campus? Would it be harder to find internships as an OMSCS student vs full time?",cfs9fe,gatech

On-campus job into which I got accepted fell silent on my end. What should I do?,4,7,"So in late April, I got an acceptance for an on-campus job in my major's outreach department, to which I gladly accepted. After they conducted and I passed a background check, they sent me this past Wednesday a verification form that I have to turn in in-person and an online course that I had to have completed by today. 

The only problem is that I'm currently OOS as I didn't expect that I'd have to turn in something on-campus ‚Äî I was intending to wait until I get a start date to come back to the campus ‚Äî and I don't have access to this course. Since it's a bit hard for me to simply drop everything and get a flight to Atlanta to turn in a form before the course's due date, I inquired on the same day to the coordinator for this outreach position as to what's going on with the course and if my current situation regarding turning in this form is preventing me from accessing this course and getting a start date. However, I did not receive any update on this matter, and since that Wednesday, I've tried the following measures to get an update:

* Emailing the coordinator twice more.

* Calling the coordinator twice more.

* Emailing HR for the college.

* Calling HR for the college.

And all of these communication attempts fell flat.

So, with this situation in mind, is there anything else I can do to reestablish communication on this matter/is there anything that I did wrong on my part? Or should I cut my losses and suspect that I've been let go? And I'm sorry if I sound desperate, it's just a job that I really wanted to have. Thank you for your help, guys!",bweefj,gatech

Managing on-campus MS CS courseload around two part-time jobs,1,2,"(tl;dr: How reasonable is it for me to be a graduate teaching assistant, a part-time software developer, and take 9 credit hours of grad-level CS courses all at the same time, and how can I best manage my workload if I pursue all three?)

&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm planning on graduating at the end of this fall semester in the **on-campus** MS CS program. However, I also have two part-time job opportunities I would like to pursue, but I'm concerned about managing my courseload. The job opportunities are:

&#x200B;

1) I was accepted to be a GTA for a 4000-level CS course this fall, which I'm very grateful for because it will fund my tuition for the semester, after paying for out-of-state tuition and on-campus housing entirely from student loans for the past two semesters. I'm also interested in the experience to see if I'd possibly be interested in teaching down the line after working in industry for a few more years.

2) Right now, I'm working a summer job as a full-stack software developer at a small local startup (5 current employees) with some fellow GT students. The startup co-founders have expressed that they've appreciated the work I've done for them over the summer enough to want to hire me on part-time during the semester, and then full-time after graduation in December.  While the co-founders are still looking for funding, they're optimistic about securing funding by the end of the year. Finances aside, I also feel like the work environment is much better for me than when I worked at a large, well-established software company for a year prior to starting grad school.

&#x200B;

I already know I don't want to forego the GTA job, and I'm hoping I can still work part-time for the startup during the semester both to help them succeed as a company and to secure my position there after graduation. However, I'll also need to take 9 credit hours of courses this semester, including CS 6515: Intro to Grad Algorithms. Do you think this is doable alongside the two jobs? Are there any graduate-level CS courses with a particularly light workload I should look into taking? I'm currently registered for the following courses, but I'm open to changing up my schedule during registration Phase II:

&#x200B;

CS 6457: Video Game Design

CS 6497: Computational Aesthetics

CS 6515: Intro to Grad Algorithms

CS 7470: Ubiquitous Computing

Scientologists on campus are a problem,92,19,"Yesterday, we heard that the scientologists were dragging people over to their table to get stress tested. Some of them were international students who didn't seem to know what was going on.

My friend went up to each student getting ""stress tested"" and told them about how the tests were not based on real science. He was probably at it for about a minute when one of the scientologists took a picture of him and told him that they were going to turn him into the cops for discrimination. Then, one of the scientologists grabbed his arm and kind of threateningly asked him if he wanted a stress test.

My friend walked away fine, but he said it was kind of scary when the man grabbed him.

Yes, scientologists have a right to speak on campus, but I think they've stepped over the line. I'm not really sure what actions can be taken against them. There should be something nonviolent organized the next time they're here.

Anyways, that's about all I have for now. Go Bucks!",e0jmyw,osu

The truth about energy petitions on campus,113,24,"Hi everyone, 

As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed, there have been tons of petitioners flooding campus talking about government bailouts, climate change, and energy efficiency standards. Currently a battle ensues between the coal and nuclear lobbyists and the environmental organizations.

Earlier this year, House Bill 6 was signed by the governor allowing two of Ohio‚Äôs coal companies and two nuclear companies to disregard Ohio‚Äôs energy efficiency standards. In addition, they are increasing Ohioan‚Äôs energy taxes to provide money for four governmental bailouts of those same companies. When a bill is signed by the governor it goes straight into effect without receiving votes from citizens. 

There are two petitions currently floating around campus: one by the environmentalists and one by the coal/nuclear lobbyists. The environmentalists are petitioning to gain ballot access on a referendum to house bill 6. This allows a vote on Election Day for, or against, this bill, hoping to kill it at the polls. These petitioners are identifiable by a large paper packet attached to their petitions, containing: an explanation to what the petition is, a certification from the attorney general that this is a legal petition, and they always ask if you‚Äôre a registered voter of Ohio before allowing you to sign the petition. Some of them are paid, some are volunteers. However, NONE of them are paid per signature. The other petition is from the coal and nuclear companies who hope to stop the referendum from reaching the polls because they assume people will vote against it. They are identifiable by one page petitions with a statement of certification at the bottom. They are not verified by the attorney general, so have no seal of approval to verify they are real. This is a political tactic called blocking. Blocking is used to confuse the public into thinking they already signed the petition so there is no need to sign again if they are ever approached by the environmentalists. People doing this are called blockers, and are paid $8 per signature. They typically do not ask if you‚Äôre registered to vote. 

I hope this clears things up!

TL:DR 
Basically, if you‚Äôre registered to vote in Ohio and a petitioner stops you ask about their credentials, and if they have them, listen to what they have to say. If not,  give em hell!",dj81bn,osu

On Campus Job Questions,2,3,"Hello, I'm an incoming transfer student that is looking at on-campus positions to help pay for school/use as disposable income.  I have a few questions about the jobs on campus and the application process:

1. did you need to provide a resume?
2. cover letter?, if so who did you address it to because I could not figure out who would actually be reading it, so I might just write: ""To whom it may concern""
3. since a lot of the jobs on campus seem to require just basic work experience, was there any difficulty with prerequisites
4. for a large school, there was not a ton, of jobs listed on a handshake, do some of these positions hire multiple people.
5. Was there ever a lot of competition to get a specific entry-level position. If so, what were the deciding factors for whoever did or didn't get fired?
6. Were hours usually flexible enough, that if you were inundated with coursework, you could either take time off or get reduced hours to catch up with school?
7. How long did it take to find out if you got the job?
8. what is the ideal time to apply for a job?
9. were there any skills not mentioned in the job description that you found to be extremely important/useful for your work?

sorry for the size of this, I just wanted to ask about everything at once. Thanks in advance for any replies and feel free to share any advice or experience that you wish you could've told your past self.",co7ype,rit

Even some academic organizations are not present.  The one I noticed was the RIT Construct which is very important for some course curriculums. 

For a lot of these clubs ROAR day has been a big source of their budget and them not being listed at all is going to hurt them big time.  The fact that they are removed is insulting to them.

Sexual predator on campus,306,56,"Something very inappropriate happened to me while walking on campus this morning and I‚Äôm not sure what to do so I‚Äôm posting it on here to hopefully raise awareness and expose this creep.

So around 10:25 am this morning I was late walking to my class, I was on the left side of Huron street walking towards the anthropology building and there was just me and this guy on the side walk. He was walking towards me but obviously I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Right as we were about to pass each other he moved to the middle of the sidewalk, closer to me and as he was passing he put his arm out and touched me inappropriately in my private area. I was shocked at what happened and didn‚Äôt see it coming at all so I really didn‚Äôt get a good look at his face. He proceeded to walk past me quickly and I yelled at him but didn‚Äôt know what else to do because of the shock and because I was already pretty late to my class. 

All I have in terms of description is that he wasn‚Äôt very tall, about 5‚Äô5‚Äù, black skin and I think he was wearing glasses. I really wish I had a better description and that I had chased after him and gotten a video or something but I was upset and shocked in the moment. 

If this has happened to anyone else on campus please speak up! People like this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to walk freely around assaulting people. Can‚Äôt go anywhere on this campus anymore without being attacked. Stay safe out there!

[edit] : I have filed an official report with campus police and Toronto police and they are working on finding the guy who assaulted me. I also want to thank everyone for all the support!

Everyone can do something to change this culture of isolation on campus.,348,71,"TL;DR: So many students feel lonely and isolated. If we want meaningful change on campus, we have to make it happen from the bottom up. Strike up friendly conversations whenever the opportunity arises, let's start to build a community.   


We're all shaken up by yet another suicide on campus, and for a lot of us it can bring out pre-existing mental health struggles. I know that when it comes to this kind of stuff, we students often feel powerless in these situations; it's the University's fault for not doing more to support us, it's the provinces fault for cutting funding, hell it's capitalism's fault for making this stuff matter so much.. and whilst all that ""bigger picture"" stuff may be true, it doesn't mean that there's nothing to be done on an individual, smaller scale. 

As a fourth year student at UofT, what I notice more than anything is that so many people feel so goddamn isolated. An overwhelming number of students say they feel stressed out but they have no one to talk to. So many say that they're in their 2nd, 3rd or 4th year and they still don't know anyone. In my opinion, there is an incredible lack of community on campus, that isn't a reflection of ""real life"" beyond University.  
For God's sake, please start talking to your fellow students!! We don't have to feel isolated, we don't have to walk through hallways completely detached from the hundreds of people around us. Let's start to create a sense of community where we can have friendly chats, even if just to connect for a few minutes. Go early to class and sit next to someone and strike up a conversation. Ask them how they're doing, what their major is, where they're from... Be friendly, smile, and reach out. Talk to the person standing next to you in line, to the person in the elevator, at the gym, in the library, or on the shuttle. If you're someone who doesn't struggle with this then you'll probably make someone else's day. If you do struggle with it, then you need it more than ever!   


Community is so important to your overall well-being, no matter what stage of life you're in. Let's try to create a UofT student community, one where we feel we're all in this together rather than competing against one another. Let's make UofT a friendly school where students feel free to just chat with one another and support one another. Sure, there's a lot more to be done at other various levels, but if EVERYONE did this, it would be a much nicer place to spend our days. Honestly, let's everyone just make an effort. You don't need to be best buddies with everyone (or anyone), let's just make people feel like they're welcome and they belong.",dbdkp4,UofT

I suppose this is most likely rejection since bloomberg conducts 3 on campus interviews at UofT, but was just curious to others experience with bloomberg interview process.

We all want to bring change, but don't know where to start.

That changes today. We're launching a Project called Project Enviropedia. The main aim: to educate people about waste management and how they can actually create an impact on society and the people they live amongst. Time's is ticking on us, it's definitely betting against us as we speak.

Strange/Creepy man repeatedly asking about walmarts/grocery stores on campus,134,34,"&#x200B;

As I was walking on campus I was asked (twice this year by the same guy) whether there were any walmarts/grocery stores nearby. The first time he asked whether there was a ""Walmart"" nearby which I thought was weird. I said there were no walmarts here and walked away. This happened towards the end of the Spring semester. I didn't think much about it, until the second time this happened on July 20th, where ""Walmart"" was replaced by ""grocery store"". I recognized him and said ""You asked me this before"", and he began to walk away.  The man is white with black hair, skinny and slightly shorter than 5""10, he also had a thick accent which I don't recognize. This happened outside, close to Gernstein. Has this happened to other people on campus? I've heard about scripts being used by men approaching McGill and Concordia students, I don't know if this is the same type of activity happening here, or what he thinks he'll get out of this, but I have the impression that he's tried this many times.",cg1fsu,UofT

Frustrated with Mental Health resources on campus? Come tell us about it! Or leave a comment down below!,6,1,"Hey uoft redditors,

I'm part of the Innovation Hub, a student-run design team on campus that collaborates with a number of UofT partners to research and ideate innovative strategies to improve the student experience.

This year we're partnering with the Presidential and Provostial Mental Health Task Force (which some of you might remember from the email the President sent out earlier this year regarding mental health on campus) to provide insights on what **real students have to say about accessing mental health help on campus**. The feedback we get from students will be reported back to the task force to inform and direct the plan of action.

We're holding our final two open campus sessions tomorrow from 3PM - 4:30PM at Bahen and on Saturday from 10AM - 11:30AM at OISE. Participants will receive **$10 gift cards to compensate** for their time and **refreshments** will be served! You can use the following link to find out how to register/where to go:

[https://www.facebook.com/events/502259143890933/](https://www.facebook.com/events/502259143890933/)

You can also **provide feedback anonymously online** ([https://forms.provost.utoronto.ca/pptfsmh-online-consultation/](https://forms.provost.utoronto.ca/pptfsmh-online-consultation/?fbclid=IwAR3JbfY9Aq0wcH6aU-id6mpSN8tfnb9Qa0SxPBrlPtc9WFUoYt1-3fTYF8E)) or by leaving a feedback card at any time during the events.

Student Project to discover & connect with new people on campus,1,0,"Hey guys, I created this website in the last couple of days that will pretty much allow you to connect with other students on campus. As a current student at Uoft, I find it pretty hard to discover new people on campus.. I know there are Uoft Facebook groups & this subreddit but those are primarily used for getting updates and asking campus-related questions‚Ä¶ not really a platform for discovering new people on campus. By providing Proximity with your basic information, the algorithm will connect you with another student on campus (what it feels will be your best match) and provide you with their Facebook Profile URL. It will also recommend you a couple of campus events that it feels will best suit your interests/faculty. You could then use Facebook Messenger as a medium for communication.

Now, I know this probably is the wrong approach to the problem or the problem doesn‚Äôt even exist at all and it‚Äôs just me, but by releasing this initially, using it myself, it allows me to test the hypothesis and further improve on the implementation. 

Proximity will allow you to start connecting once 10 students register for the site (since I don‚Äôt want you to go initially to the site and see a blank white screen‚Ä¶).

So if you are interested, click the link and sign up! [https://www.proximity.vision](https://www.proximity.vision/)

So a bunch of us are working on an Android App limited to Canadian university students (for now) that lets people create their own events such as Pickup ball/soccer games, Board Games, ect.... These events would then appear on the feed of the main app and users could filter these events by what they are interested in and then choose to attend these events.

Student lounges in On-Campus buildings,5,5,"In anticipation of finals, what buildings do you know that have student lounges/study spaces that aren't classrooms? Where are they in the building?

Most of my class buildings don't have lounges/study spaces (RIP psych majors) so I'm hoping to come up with a decent list of buildings that have lounges on campus. It would be great if you could include any amenities (has plenty of outlets!) or drawbacks (only available to people in XYZ major).

I'm going with classroom buildings so the library, Squires, GBJ student center, the GLC, and dining halls aren't on here.

To start the list:

Litton-Reaves: Two lounges on the first floor, one to the right of the main entrance and one down the hall to the left. Some outlets, but not at every seat; chairs and tables.

Sandy: First floor is mostly lounge space, open to only neuroscience majors after a certain time (10pm?). Not sure about outlet situation; chairs and tables.

New Classroom Building: Lounge on 1st floor by Derring parking lot entrance, study spaces/mini lounges on every floor on far ends. Outlets in all the mini study spaces, not sure about the lounge; mostly tables, a few individual chairs.

Williams: 4 tables by the front door, usually full during the day. Maybe outlets by the two back tables; no individual chairs

Lavery (Turner Place): Ledges for sitting on 3rd and 4th floor along hallway. No tables, two small (1-2 person) couches at the very end of the hall, few outlets.

Davidson: Chem study lounge on 2nd floor; two tables with bench seats on first floor, usually full. Tables and chairs; plenty of outlets at the bench seat tables, not sure about the lounge.",e63oks,VirginiaTech
every now and then I see something on campus that reminds me of the Hokie community feeling that initially drew me to Tech,263,16,"This morning on the bus a girl passed out literally as she stepped off the bus, and landed unconscious almost under the bus.

She was half conscious, seemed confused and dazed but conscious-ish so hopefully she‚Äôs ok.

I know this is/should be human decency but even so, this type of community and decency is not seen everywhere it should be seen. Reminds me of when I first visited VT as a prospective student - we saw a biker crash into a car near the Newman roundabout and immediately a dozen people ran to help.

Prospective student wondering about a few specific clubs on campus (Chess/Esports),6,5,"Hey r/VirginiaTech,

I've narrowed down my final college decision to either Virginia Tech, Clemson, or Penn State (In-state). I have some time to make my final decision, but I have definitely been leaning towards Virginia Tech recently. I will be visiting all three of my options in the next couple weeks (I haven't been on any of their campuses yet) and am hoping they all live up to what I've seen online.

My main questions having to do with Virginia Tech is about clubs. I am very into eSports and Chess. What kind of video game scene is there on campus? I'd really like to have plenty of people to play and watch League of Legends with. Some kind of established esports scene on campus would help ease my fears of not being able to make friends easily in college. As far as chess goes, I'd really like to be part of an active club, but in general I'd just like to be able to play against people over the board somewhat frequently. Does anyone have any experience with chess matches on campus?

That's bout it! If anyone would like to help me make my final decision on which school to go to I'm definitely interested in hearing what anyone has to say because I honestly hate making decisions. 

Thanks!!",ay2vlk,VirginiaTech

"I was approached by a sinister cult on campus recently, everyone be on alert",109,36," Please, everyone, read this post in its entirety, as I don‚Äôt want the fate which I narrowly avoided to befall any fellow Knights. I‚Äôve heard lots of rumors in the area of cults like God the Mother, Scientologists, and even Mormons trying to recruit on our campus. However, I think I‚Äôve just come into contact with a group of an even worse breed.

I was trudging through the crowded sidewalk of Aquarius Agora Drive, bobbing and weaving between students to get to my destination faster. I, of course, consistently walk approximately 17% faster than the average speed of my colleagues, enough for people to notice that I am faster and give the appearance that I have business to attend to, but not so fast as to make myself look like a bumbling fool who had soiled their pants, because that was only one time and it wasn‚Äôt even when I was at UCF so it doesn‚Äôt count. 

I was eager to get to my Introduction to the Engineering Profession lab, and I had only 7 minutes to get there if I was to arrive at my standard 25 minutes early. I knew that if I were to make it, I would need to take the most treacherous path on campus known to any rat or man, Marketplace Wednesday. 

Now, being the stoic intellectual that I am, I‚Äôm more than well equipped to handle Marketplace Wednesday. I remembered the advice I had received from comments here on the subreddit, and I got geared up for battle. I donned my headphones. I slid my sunglasses on, the frames effortlessly gliding across my well-oiled skin. I cranked the most recently downloaded episode of the Joe Rogan Experience I had on my Google Pixel 3 and charged in, upping my speed to a smooth 21% faster than that of the average student. 

I was making it through alright. I zipped past the Pre-Dental Association no problem. Made it by the United Nations Association without being handed a flyer. I even was able to avoid TPUSA, their large collection of ‚ÄúSOCIALISM SUCKS‚Äù buttons on display for all of campus to see. When suddenly, I was stopped by a man. An older gentleman, around the neighborhood of 30 from the assessment I had made from my ocular patdown. At first, I was worried that Jobs4Knights had seen my earlier expos√© on their evils on campus, and they had sent one of their goons after me to rough me up. But this man had a clipboard in each hand, and two more tucked under his arm. 

‚ÄúAre you registered to vote in Florida?‚Äù he inquired. I froze. I had never seen such aggressive behavior from the likes of tablefolk on campus before. Clearly, he‚Äôs not with an RSO, I thought to myself. Unfamiliar with the protocol moving forward, I engaged, hoping that if I talked to him his hostilities wouldn‚Äôt grow. 

‚ÄúUh, y-yes..?‚Äù I squeaked out. I strongly believe in the civic duty of voting, and have been a registered libertarian for years, but I was still cautious of this strange man‚Äôs motives. 

That‚Äôs when his mouth began uttering the most puzzling incantations my ears have ever fallen prey to. ‚ÄúWoulyouliketsignthispetitiotohelprequireallbillinthelegislaturquiredbevotedontwiceithelpstrenghenthevotingproce-‚Äù

This strange speaking in tongues seemed to get faster as the man went on, filling my head with madness and draining my robust brain of its sanity. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I felt a dark force attempt to overcome me, clearly a hex being placed on me by this clipboard cultist. A sweat broke out across my already-moist forehead, and in a moment of panic, I dashed past him, breaking out into a full 54% faster than the average student speed, my underdeveloped legs kicking their movements into overdrive. I headed towards the safety that is the Engineering I building, not daring to glance back in case the cultist had decided to give chase. 

These are dark times, Knights, these are dark times indeed. I don‚Äôt know what deity you all pray to, but pray that you do not fall victim to the dark hexes of this wicked group of cultists. 

Remember, the spell they use to draw you in sounds like, ‚ÄúAre you registered to vote in Florida?‚Äù If you hear these words, run as fast as you can. I‚Äôll fill out a report with local law enforcement, but not even the justice system can defeat the dark psychic force present on our campus.

Tips on getting a job on campus?,18,13,"Hey everyone, so I‚Äôve been searching for a job for awhile and have been coming up empty handed. For some background I‚Äôve never had a job before, I‚Äôve done a lot of volunteer work though which I believe have given me the necessary people skills. I don‚Äôt have transportation, so the job has to be on campus or around it so I can get there. I just had a few questions:

Are there times of year where jobs on campus hire a lot of new people? If so, when are they?

How did you get your job? Did you have to wait awhile (weeks or months) after submitting your application?

What can I do to stand out? I‚Äôve tried calling places back and coming in person on occasion, but it‚Äôs not very useful when places are simply accepting applications but not looking to hire.

What places are currently hiring that aren‚Äôt considered work study?

Sorry for all the questions, I‚Äôve never had a job before but will really need one, so I‚Äôm looking for all the help I can get. Is the solution to just keep doing what I‚Äôm doing and hope for the best? I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything obvious. Thank you!",ctn7ac,ucf

Water Guns aren't allowed on campus but Pocket Knives are,22,12,"I was bored so I started to read the Community Living Guide just to see what bullshit rules exist and I came across this beauty. 

> a. Possession, storage, manufacture, or use of weapons or munitions is prohibited in residential facilities.   
>  
>...  
>  
> Weapons include, but are not limited to: guns (e.g. BB/Pellet guns, nerf, water, airsoft, paintball), sporting/hunting, edged (e.g. knives, swords), blunt (e.g. martial arts, night stick), and stun guns. 

I'm like wtf water guns aren't allowed on campus that's kinda dumb. But I see the wording ""include, but are not limited too"" and I think well what does that include the options are endless. So the Living community guide has a link for more information with the Rules of conduct section 12. So I go there and it says this. 

>The possession, use, or storage of weapons on property owned or controlled by the University or at events sponsored and/or supported by the University is prohibited, except as specifically outlined in University Policy 3-119.1 (Weapons on University Property and at University Events). 

At this point I'm excited to see there are exceptions. Now up to now I noticed there are very little definitions going on the closest I got was on the Community Living Guide but it was also very open ended. So in search for this University policy and more definitions I go the the Golden Rule handbook. BIG waste of time pretty much said the same thing as rules of conduct. Turns out its at the UCF Policies and Procedures website completely different. And there I find it. 

> Weapon. A thing designed or intended, or which may reasonably be used for inflicting bodily harm. The term ‚Äúweapon‚Äù includes firearms, swords, knives (except common pocket knives), incendiary devices, chemical devices, or missiles. The term ‚Äúweapon‚Äù includes any object legally controlled as a weapon or treated as a weapon under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the university owned or controlled property is located. 

The glorious words ""except common pocket knives"". And I came to the clear conclusion I am allowed to have a pocket knife on campus but God forbid I have a water gun. 

After this I did a little more digging in the Florida Statutes and I found that pocket knives there are also not weapons. 

> (13)‚ÄÉ‚ÄúWeapon‚Äù means any dirk, knife, metallic knuckles, slungshot, billie, tear gas gun, chemical weapon or device, or other deadly weapon except a firearm or a common pocketknife, plastic knife, or blunt-bladed table knife.

"Questions about working at places off campus (Bivouac, restaurants, etc) vs on-campus jobs",8,3,"For anyone who has experience working at places off campus, what's it like? I'd really like to apply to places like Bivouac and some resturants off campus so I can start working this summer and hopefully keep the job during the school year, but obviously working in retail/service industry is a lot different than working at the library or dining halls in terms of shift flexibility.

&#x200B;

Looking at my schedule for fall semester, there's not really more than 3 hours of free time during my days, but evenings and my weekends are open. I know students work at these places, but I'm not sure if places allow for short shift flexibility (working 3-4hr shifts instead of the typical 6-8), and allow students to work \~10 hrs a week, or if they prefer students who have more open schedules and can work closer to 20hrs a week.

Ben Shapiro should not be allowed to speak on campus,0,55,"Until I am addressed by the mods I will continue to post this. This is an extremely important issue on campus

First off, yes this is a throwaway, yes it is inherently political, and yes this will likely be deleted or locked within an hour even though it‚Äôs a serious issue.

Ben Shapiro is an outrageously homophobic and racist man. I‚Äôm not here to criticize his economics, but the fact that the university allows someone like him to speak here, ON SCHOOL GROUND. As freshman we are all required to take classes about how racism, sexism, etc are a real and present danger in modern society, and are taught to respect people‚Äôs pronouns and the like, all before we arrive on campus. Free speech is one thing, but he is actively professing racist and homophobic (referring to the LGBTQ community in general here) beliefs. Here‚Äôs a quote from him about his position on trans people:

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt magically change your gender.‚Äù - As quoted in Ben Shapiro, a Provocative ‚ÄòGladiator,‚Äô Battles to Win Young Conservatives

Regardless if whoever‚Äôs reading this is transphobic, the university has publicly said it is not, which is why it teaches people to state their pronouns and for those listening to call them by them. Want more examples? Here‚Äôs a quote from him about the systematic oppression of blacks in America:

‚ÄúBut the idea that every black person now is being individually victimized by the United States is not true. ... Way down at the bottom are white straight males.‚Äù

Same source
I‚Äôll list more at the end of this if you remain unconvinced.

It is completely disgusting that the University is allowing him to speak on campus (if it were some random joint in Ann Arbor, that‚Äôs one thing, but this is a campus that preaches equality and being actively against racism, homophobia, sexism, and the like), and I don‚Äôt care if YAF paid for it. The University should be rejecting him no questions asked, he goes against everything they believe, and shows their willingness to sell out for a little cash or conservative appeal. It‚Äôs disgusting and should not be tolerated

On Campus Jobs over the Summer?,10,5,"I've been looking to see if there are any part-time jobs on campus I could do between semesters and I'm kinda hitting a brick wall so far.

There really aren't a ton of positions available there right now, at least not for my focus (CS, artistic, and IT-related fields). And a lot of the postings that used to be there in the past month had the ""seasonal"" description, which makes it seem like those jobs won't start until the next semester. I've even emailed the Rutgers Cinema about openings using their contact form but got no response so far. 

Are there any other resources or people to talk to about finding a part-time job for this summer?

On-campus employment taxation for international students,3,9,"I am an international student under a J-1 Visa. This month I got an on-campus job at a dining court and I just started yesterday. I had to fill out a ton of paperwork and get permissions and everything is done now, but I am very confused regarding taxation on my employment. Shortly after accepting my job offer I got an e-mail from Purdue's GLACIER service asking me to fill out some forms on-line (I believe one of them was W-4). I have some questions regarding this because I don't quite understand how are taxes gonna work for me.

1 - My hourly wage is $9.00. is that gonna be my final wage or do I still have to substract taxes out of it?

2 - When applying for a job, I claim an exemption to withholdings. I'm not sure what this means but I believe it's a way of saying that I don't think I need to pay taxes on my wage because of my exchange student/international condition. Is this right?

3 - Anyway, when filling out the GLACIER forms, the website determined i was not elegible for exemption claims or something like that. But the generated W-4 form has the ""total number of allowances you're claiming"" section set to 1 and the Indiana W-4 form has also set an exemption claim. So really I have no clue of what's going on and what's gonna happen to my wages and if I'm gonna need to file an income tax detail in April.",d5iv71,Purdue

Normally rent is $535 but I'm willing to haggle and make up the difference to sell the apartment. Its a full year lease from August 2019 to August 2020. Electricity is included in the rent and ISP options are Metronet (highly recommended) and Comcast I believe.

A floor plan is included. The apartment is small but has the basic amenities and is a prime location with low cost for the location.

Are There Any UI/UX Organizations on Campus?,9,10,"Hey, PSU!

I'm currently a rising junior in the Bellisario College of Communications studying advertising with minors in digital media trends & analytics and IST. I'm focusing my career goals on digital strategy and learning a lot through my internships and extracurriculars.

I'm extremely interested in user experience design and even considered switching to the Design + Development track in the College of IST, but didn't like how it seemed to lack a focus on human interaction and the creative side of the field. They finally added an undergraduate major in Human-Centered Design and Development for the fall, which I believe provides solid experience in subjects like UX/UI, but it is too late for me to switch. (I wouldn't be able to graduate in four years and cannot afford extra semesters of out-of-state tuition.)

Does anyone know if there are any student orgs that give students an opportunity to learn user experience skills and work on projects? I know there are various design clubs on campus, but I am unsure if they are more related to graphic design. I would really like to get my feet wet and develop some basic portfolio pieces for my resume and potentially for grad school!

If nothing like this exists, would there be any interest in starting a UX/UI club on campus? I know it is a growing field that not many people are aware of, but I think it would be a great experience to get communications, psychology, and technology majors to mingle and blend their talents.

Prospective student wondering about a few specific clubs on campus (Chess/Esports),1,2,"Hey r/PennStateUniversity,

I've narrowed down my final college decision to either Virginia Tech, Clemson, or Penn State (In-state). I have some time to make my final decision, but I have definitely been leaning towards Penn State recently. I will be visiting all three of my options in the next couple weeks (I haven't been on any of their campuses yet) and am hoping they all live up to what I've seen online.

My main questions having to do with Penn State is about clubs. I am very into eSports and Chess. What kind of video game scene is there on campus? I'd really like to have plenty of people to play and watch League of Legends with. Some kind of established eSports scene on campus would help ease my fears of not being able to make friends easily in college. As far as chess goes, I'd really like to be part of an active club, but in general I'd just like to be able to play against people over the board somewhat frequently. Does anyone have any experience with chess matches on campus?

That's bout it! If anyone would like to help me make my final decision on which school to go to I'm definitely interested in hearing what anyone has to say because I honestly hate making decisions.

Thanks!!",b0m0cg,PennStateUniversity

I keep hearing and reading online that you can park free (no permit) on campus after a certain hour in specific lots on weekdays, and free parking in specific lots on weekends so long as no events are going on.

Can somebody please give a list of which parking lots are actually open for free and during what hours?

I know that IST & Eisenhower deck are free on weekends and on evenings in weekdays.

Random Verbal offense by homeless people on campus,22,36,"What is the best way to deal with randomly encountered verbal offenses? Especially from homelesses on campus?

It happened 15 mins ago, I was walking through the front of Koerner library, and a random homeless just stopped there when I am passing by, and start spiting offensive words to me. Like F*** and more. 

I immediately dropped my backpack and held my skateboard like a baseball bat, in defense position, ready for a physical fight. It might because our size are close (I'm 182 and he's about 185cm), and a meter long longboard is somewhat visually impacting as a weapon, he kept a distance from me and never got closer than a meter. 

He spoke for about 25 seconds and left while talking. Through the whole encounter, his voice was not loud that only people with in 4m radius could hear what he said.

He also tends to challenge me for a fight, like ""Come on, you ****!"". I think giving the first punch (Or smash with my board) would put me out of legitimate defense and will go against the law, so I stayed without saying anything, but telling him I won't fight unless he starts it.

After he walked far enough, I lowered my board, put my stuff back on and continued my walk. There's no physical conflict but I think we all feel angry when someone attacks you with language, knowing you can't initate a fight before he take~ the first move, and he never gives you the chance. 

I wonder if there's a better way to deal with these random encounter of verbal attacks. I thought about pulling out my phone and call 911  or campus security while he's talking, but I think holding a phone on one of my hands will put me in a vulnerable position. It's hard to fight when one hand is unprepared and my focus is distracted to calling help.

Any help will be appreciated.",drs7m0,UBC

I'm cool with leaving you a deposit for the thing if I can grab it back when I return the controller (can give you some $ for the trouble after as well). Otherwise I'd be interested in just buying a controller but that seems like it'd be better if done outside of this sub.",cr1q01,UBC
"Looking for on-campus work? The Dept of Psychology is hiring in IT, communications/web development, graphic design, and software development!",22,2,"Hey /r/UBC, the Department of Psychology has several Work Learn positions currently on UBC CareersOnline and we thought some of you might be interested! Here are some quick TL;DRs of the positions. Unless otherwise stated, all positions are 10 hours/week.

To apply, log into https://ubc-csm.symplicity.com/students with your CWL and click on Jobs > Search in the left sidebar, then either click 'See all jobs' or search for the specific job posting title or ID you are interested in.

Please note that even though we have included links to contact some of the people below, the only way you can be accepted into a Work Learn position is by applying through the CareersOnline website. Emailing someone your resume and cover letter doesn‚Äôt count as a job application!

#WL W19 Research IT Support Coordinator - ID: 868836

#WL W19 Junior IT Support Analyst - ID: 868822

A key component of the IT department within Psychology are our awesome Work Learn students and we're always looking for new students who want to gain some experience working in IT. It can be hard to get your foot in the door in this industry - but if you are the go-to person in your family or circle of friends for IT help (or enjoy fiddling around with technology in your spare time), have good written and verbal communication skills, and are a quick learner ... we would love to work with you!

The two job postings referenced above are almost identical, but the Research IT Support Coordinator will be expected to perform some audio-visual troubleshooting and will get to assist with troubleshooting research technologies, whereas the Junior IT Support Analyst position is more of what most people would consider a basic entry-level IT position. When in doubt, feel free to email us with any questions - or just apply to both!

Live at home or on campus?,5,8,"\*\*\*\*Live at home or off campus but in EL 

Hi r/msu! I'm going to be a senior in spring. I've lived on and off at home and in apartments since I transferred to MSU a few years ago. My parents' place is only 15 miles from school, so it never made sense for me to spend $500/month to live a little closer.

Unfortunately my car broke down last winter and I can't get a car again until next fall. My choice seems to be getting rides to school with my mom or finding last minute accommodation for spring and hopefully getting a car for next year. Honestly I've just been getting rides the last few weeks. It's kind of humiliating but works, but I don't know if I can deal with it next semester due to my schedule (mom goes to work at 6am, comes home 6-7pm when most of my classes are done at 2pm).

I don't really know what to do. In my culture and family, living at home for somebody my age (early or mid twenties) is completely acceptable. I would actually prefer to stay at home, even though I pay all my own bills. At the same time, I can probably offset most of the ""Losses"" of living near school by working part time (I already have one part time job that pays $1,000 per month, it is bascialyl pasive income and requires very little time commitment) + financial aid.

What would you do? I have lived on my own before and do not care about ""independence."" My priority is having money so I can live comfortably, travel, etc but I also don't want to spend most of my semester sitting in the library waiting to go home when i am as old as i am",9vzkjs,msu

I've been looking at the different colleges and I am stuck between Warren and Sixth college (Comp-Sci Major). I know they are building the new Sixth dorms so they will probably be super nice, but the GEs at Warren are a little better. I've also heard that the Warren dorms and apartments aren't as desirable, but I would love if anyone could give some input. Thanks!",dz96q2,ucsd

The top seven bike brands that are abandoned on campus,58,18,"[I'm one of the people who handles abandoned bikes that people leave behind on campus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/8gtec2/moving_out_of_the_dorms_lets_talk_about_your_bike/) After a year and a half of collecting data I'm pleased to present the top seven bike brands that people abandoned and I removed. In descending order of frequency, they are:

* Roadmaster
* Huffy
* Next
* Schwinn
* Mongoose
* Magna 
* Ozone

It's no coincidence that these are some of the cheapest brands that you can pick up at big box stores (e.g. Walmart, Target, Academy). Of course there's bias here, as there are simply a lot of these brands on campus to begin with due to their wide availability and low cost. However, there is a huge difference in the condition of your typical Roadmaster versus a ""bike store brand"" (e.g. Trek, Giant, Specialized) once it comes into my care. The latter typically only need a tune-up and maybe a new set of tires to make them perfectly functional. The former are almost all [rusty, UV-rotted garbage.](https://imgur.com/a/T60E7Pj) I am convinced that the rapid deterioration of these bikes is the cause of their abandonment in most cases. 

For better or worse, almost all bike parking on campus is exposed to the weather (there are some dorms with indoor bike rooms). Your bike is going to get wet and sit in the sun. If you want to get good value for your money, consider a refurbished bike store brand bike that is built with better, more weather-resistant materials. 

Finally, an expanded bike share system is coming to campus this fall semester. If you're not an avid bike rider and aren't sure if you want to own your own bike on campus, consider using Bulldog Bike Share (details to be announced soon). These bikes will be all over campus and will be actively maintained by system staff. ",8qa8ty,UGA

Has anyone held multiple on-campus jobs at the same time? Is that even possible/allowed?

How do you decide between which job will be better for you without working there?

I recently applied to 2 on-campus jobs (Job A and Job B). I had left my previous job because of poor management and stress level related to it. However, I wanted to have a job secured before leaving.

When applying and interviewing, I initially wanted Job B more as it seemed more structured with minimal interaction. Job A got back to me first tho and, although I felt confident I could get Job B, I didn't want to turn down A in case I never received an offer from B. I have since started job A, although a few days into starting I received an offer from job B (which I accepted), but wouldn't be starting until close to the end of winter break.

Both pay a similar amount and money isn't the biggest issue (nor is the experience). The main reason I left my previous job was because it was taking a toll on my mental health and I want to make sure that I pick the job that would take the least toll on me and my schoolwork.

From experience, I've learned not to judge a job until you've left the training phase and are actually doing the work. Because of this, I can't really judge whether or not Job A is alright for me. It would be working for some very high-level school officials, so I know for certain it could be demanding at times. It's also more hands-on.

I haven't been to Job B yet and have no idea how the workload would be, but from what I was told its mainly emailing, documentation, and answering the phone. My only issue would be the time commitment (Job A seems very lenient on scheduling time).

Any Advice?

TLDR : Was offered 2 on-campus job positions (and stupidly accepted both). I have no idea how to choose between them as I have yet to experience both to decide which is a better fit for me.",e6tfaa,asu

Living Off-Campus vs On-Campus for Sophomore Year,5,5,"Hello,

I am currently a freshman in Computer Science, and am living in Tooker House. However, for Sophomore year I do not really want to live at Tooker anymore. Next year a whole new batch of freshmen will come in, and I feel like I won't have any relevant conversations to hold with them. Now onto the questions:

1. Is it better to live off-campus or on-campus during Sophomore year?
2. What are some off-campus or on-campus dorms that you recommend?

On-Campus Housing: The Be All End All Post,49,37,"Just gonna make this as inclusive as possible, feel free to add thoughts in the comments. I'm going to go over both freshman and upper division housing considering the volume of upper division posts recently, and the likelihood of a post increase as we go into the spring semester and potential freshmen get serious about ASU. 


I will only be covering Tempe Housing and Taylor Place (Downtown), so if Poly, West, Havasu (lol) people wanna chime in feel free. I'm not covering Roosevelt Point (Downtown) because I don't know shit about it. I wont' cover pricing, it's up to you to look up the housing options and decide if they're in your budget.


***Freshman Housing***

**Taylor Place**: Pretty solid overall, typical freshman experience. Situated right in the middle of everything at the Downtown Campus. A few floors are reserved for the Barrett community so if you're interested in being around Barrett students that's an option. Every other floor is connected by a staircase (2-3, 4-5, etc...). Rooms are similar to other shared dorm rooms, has liquid/solid composting toilet and regular sized bathroom. Dining hall is acceptable (Better than Hassyampa IMO), and used to provide tupperware for spare food though I am unsure of if this is still a practice. 

**Barrett Complex**: Pretty quality, but a bit pricey compared to other options. Requires Barrett enrollment which makes you take HON 171/272. Rooms types: shared room:shared bathroom, private room:shared bathroom, studio, quad (4 private rooms with 2 bathrooms total + living room). Main room is furnished. Each building/cluster of buildings has a floor with a TV, functioning kitchen and full laundry room. Pool/ping pong available at the front desk in Honors Hall. Hit or miss on social interaction. You either get really social or you get an introvert floor. Cereus/Cottonwood/Juniper are pretty social halls iirc. Dining hall rivals Tooker for the best on campus. Sits in the southeast corner of campus, so it's a bit of a trek if you have courses on the north or west end of campus, but it's still manageable as you can cross campus in 15 minutes walking. 

**Tooker**: Rivals Barrett in quality and price. All Engineering students and similar majors. Rooms are about the same size as other buildings. Free echo dot for living there (they used to do this, idk about now), pretty social atmosphere, lot of public study areas for your floor, pretty well situated as far as getting to engineering courses on the north end of campus goes. Dining room quality is near the best on campus. 

**Adelphi Commons II**: Essentially apartments, it's arranged by clusters because it used to be a sorority complex before the GLV came out. Now it's the the College of Integrative Arts and Sciences + Sustainability haven. It's right next to Adelphi 1, Barrett, and the complex with the campus walmart and other restaurant. You'd default to Barrett or Hassy dining halls from here.

**Adelphi Commons I**: See above, but is essentially alternative housing for WPC. 

**Hassyampa**: There are two sides to Hassyampa, a west and an east. Hassy is one of the apexes of freshman socialization. Rooms are decently spacious but still have a weird stone ceiling. Elevators always smell like weed, even if no one is smoking. Hassy dining hall isn't terrible, but isn't up to par with Tooker and Barrett. If you're in WPC and you wanna be social, this is probably where you're gonna end up.

**Best/Hayden**: For Herberger. I wouldn't live here if I was paid to on account of smaller rooms and communal bathrooms. Oldest dorms on campus along with Irish. **Irish** is in the same little complex but isn't just Herberger. Close to a lot of stuff on campus, so I suppose that's a plus. 

**San Pablo**: Near Tooker, covers a few colleges. Pretty basic experience, but I'd probably opt for PV West if given the choice. 

**PV West/East**: West is better and more social in addition to being nearer to the study area/POD/starbucks/etc... East isn't bad but people generally aim for West. Don't think I've actually met someone who lives in East. North side of campus near Tooker. 

**Manzanita**: One of the nicer freshman housing options, it's just east of tooker and PV. It has it's own dining hall (about the same quality as Hassy) and has a solid social scene. 

**Century (Poly**: Commentor opinion: ""I'm a current freshman living in Century Hall on Poly so here's my take: Dorms are rather basic but modern. You share a bathroom with 2 suitemates, so the bathroom is quite large, but can get cluttered quickly. All the freshman are there, barrett is on 3rd floor but it's gotten big enough that it's overflown to the 2nd floor. Walls are thin so if you're blasting music/doing the sex/talking loud enough it'll be heard. Right next to Citrus dining, poly market, and the SDFC. Classrooms are a quick walk, and even quicker bike/board ride. As for dining, it's the only one on campus so it's rather basic but palatable IMO. Even if you're barrett, on poly you only get a standard meal plan. The Student Union also has some to-go options. Century is rather pricy as it's newer, around 7.5k/sem. Upper div lives in converted officer houses for about half the price.""

*If you have anything to add to these, comment it. My experience is mostly with Tooker/Barrett/Hassy/Taylor Place so other insights are appreciated*

***Upper Division***

*Disclaimer*: NO UPPER DIVISION HOUSING HAS DORM ROOM SOCIALIZATION. IT'S EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS IF YOU PUT YOUR BEST FOOT FORWARD BUT NO ONE IS GOING TO DROP FRIENDS IN YOUR LAP LIKE THEY DID FRESHMAN YEAR. That question has been asked a lot and this is the answer to that. 

**Vista Del Sol**: Apartments. Kinda pricey, rooms are nice and come with fully equipped kitchens. There are different room configurations for shared or private, but most are private room/private bath with connected living rooms. Full amenities included, internet isn't bad. Not super social but there are ways to make friends.

**Greek Leadership Village**: You ***MUST*** be associated with a fraternity or sorority that has a building in the GLV to live here. Rooms and common areas are really nice and you exclusively live with your brothers/sisters. It's close to campus as well and provides easy access to the east end. Only downside is they are still essentially dorms and ASU is scrutinizing your every move. 

**Villas at Vista**: Vista but better. Apartments and townhouse-esque buildings available. Slightly more expensive but just across the street from vista. Very nice overall if you can justify the price, and they're no longer restricted to Greek Life and Athletics. 

**University House**: Run of the mill apartment building, pool in the middle. Gets very rowdy on game days and has a pretty vibrant party/drinking scene, but as a result of it now being ASU owned it and thus *on campus*, it is under scrutiny. Some of the balconies near the top allow you to look into Sun Devil Stadium. 

**Sonora**: Lower end of things, but still acceptable. Just south of Vista, not bad pricing, just a bit farther of a walk. Elevators like to stop working sometimes so if you're on the 5th floor, have fun. 

**Rise on Apache and 922 Place**: University House but on Apache and nicer overall. I have no real complaints about Rise, very nice apartments. Maybe gets a bit loud because most people who live there like to have a good time. Pretty social overall.

*Rise on Apache Commentor Opinion*: "" They‚Äôre known for having the worst management by far of the complexes in the area and will have water or electricity cut out for extended periods of time occasionally.""

**McClintock International Commons**: Meh

Upper division students can choose to live in communities such as: Tooker, Barrett, Hayden, etc... but those vary by experience.

I'll update this periodically as I get more information, just a basic outline for now. Comment with your experiences and I'll make edits.

Happy Innovating!

Atheist club(s) on campus?,12,8,"Ok so just to preface this, I respect those who believe in religion I just find myself not believing in a God, afterlife, or any thing religion related at this point. 

I was raised Mormon so it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt choose this for myself or that I‚Äôm totally foreign to to concept of church and a faith community. The problem that I keep finding is that a whole lot of my friends prior to my ‚Äúfaith transition‚Äù if you will, were Mormon and although I have a few exmormon friends, most of them are just in entirely different life stages than I am. 

Also a lot are very angry that the LDS church (understandably if you‚Äôve lost 10% of your income for several years of your life because you were indoctrinated and socially required to give, basically lied to about several church history aspects, check out /r/exmormon for more), and I think a lot of the dwelling on this anger is pretty toxic to where I am in life. 

So basically like some people in college I just have no friends in college and making them is hard. All of my classes are basically huge classes still which is hard to talk to people when you don‚Äôt know if you have anything in common (ok yes the degree, but that‚Äôs not a lot to go on). I think the only thing I really miss about religion is how easy it is to make friends, and the many social activities I participated in. 

So does ASU have an atheist club on campus? For anyone who knows, is it all centered around religion bashing (not preferred) or is it more chill and activity oriented or something entirely different? If there isn‚Äôt a club is anyone interested in unofficially trying to make one and see how it goes?",ao7a8l,asu

"On-campus housing, off-campus housing, or commute to ASU Tempe campus?",10,25,"Hey guys, so I‚Äôll be going to ASU Barrett this fall as a freshman. I already applied for housing (Agave), but I never submitted the application and I‚Äôm starting to have second thoughts about on-campus living. I‚Äôm almost positive that it would be significantly cheaper for me to just rent a room in an apartment or house nearby and go to school. The main issue is the meal plan. I‚Äôm a small Asian girl and I seriously do not think I‚Äôll spend $5500 for a whole school year‚Äôs worth of food (and that‚Äôs not even three meals a day smh). I‚Äôm also am considering bringing my car with me on campus, so I don‚Äôt really want to pay for parking fees either. On the other hand, I live about 25 minutes away from ASU, and I could commute to school, but I‚Äôm honestly only planning to dorm for freshman year for the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù.

What do you guys recommend? (Also, do I even need a car on campus?)

On Campus Housing Availability for Upperclassmen,0,1,"When I went on my campus tour around Christmas time I was told that on campus housing for upper class men was not guaranteed by my tour guide.

All I could gather was it seems like Bothell may have a bit more capacity with \~ 5 dorm style buildings. Tacoma's Court 17 is at capacity and has a wait list right now. They can accommodate 290 students which seems like a smallish percentage of the overall student population. I really don't know if Bothell can accommodate more.

Want to be part of a community on campus? Look no further than Unite UW!,54,20,"I know what you're thinking. This is probably just some shameless self-promotion of a club. But no, it isn't. I'm posting on Reddit today to talk about a life-changing experience that I had throughout my first year at UW. And that is what Unite UW is. 

Maybe you've seen our advertisements around campus, maybe you were at the Uniters of UW photojournalism event in the HUB (if so, my username may be familiar), 

This amazing program has been one of the most intellectually and personally stimulating experiences I have gotten in life. It's an on-campus cultural exchange program, run by the Office of Student Life. The program aims to engage students in quarter-long cultural exchanges (through weekly meetings, bi-weekly hangouts, and a big retreat during week 3/4 of the quarter) to enhance global understanding, overcome barriers and boundaries, inspire lasting international relationships and ultimately unify the experiences of domestic and international students at UW. I've gained so many beneficial people skills from participating in the program, I was able to be my genuine self for the first time, while also feeling safe and accepted by everyone, and made a ton of amazing friendships along the way.

This past year, I was pretty depressed. A mix of personal problems in my life and harassment/death threats experienced at UW. I tried to commit suicide twice, ending up in a hospital for hurting myself the second time - but there was always something positive that stopped me from doing so. I reached out to all of the friends I've made throughout two quarters of participation in the program, and still do so that they can understand my progress through the insane journey that is my mental health. Unite UW is more than just a club or a group of friends, it's a family. A family that does what families do best - care about others.

And I don't regret signing up for Unite UW.  The people there encouraged me to continue being as outgoing, positive and friendly as I am, had me understand that it‚Äôs okay to be not okay, were there for me and inspired me to have the increasing desire of being there for others.

Most importantly, everyone made their best effort in making people feel like they belonged. And it worked.

If you have any interest in the program, you can message me or discuss it/ask questions on this post. 

Also check out their website:  [https://depts.washington.edu/uniteuw/](https://depts.washington.edu/uniteuw/)  and maybe apply for fall if you're moved by this at all:  [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEnzn15WnqX1CVuuycxU0NHDd6k3QIFgZ0zjLDJcb3BI-7CA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEnzn15WnqX1CVuuycxU0NHDd6k3QIFgZ0zjLDJcb3BI-7CA/viewform)",cne96j,udub

On-campus job dilemma,3,14,"Hey, Huskies!

I am moving to Seattle this fall to pursue my graduate degree in Information Management at the University of Washington this fall. To offset my living expenses, I've been applying to on-campus jobs. I was recently hired for a Dining Assistant position by Pagliacci at Local point which pays 16$/hr. I've already completed the Workday action items for this job. Now yesterday, I was offered an interview for the Office Manager position at UW Graduate and Professional Student Senate (UW GPSS). This will pay me 18$/hr but I'm confused about going ahead with the interview. 

Pagliacci will be more physically taxing but it'll allow me to just switch off mentally and earn my living. With this other job, I might have to get more involved with the organization. I'm not sure how well it'll go with the academics in my first quarter.

What do you guys think I should do? Should I stick to Pagliacci or go ahead with the interview and potentially get the Office Manager job?

For reference, here is what the job entails:
Acting as a public face for GPSS by serving administrative tasks, such as being present at the front desk to greet visitors and answer questions, answering the telephone, and managing all inquiries received through the primary GPSS email address (gpss@uw.edu).
Assisting in regular activities of the five GPSS Officers. This includes keeping track of the main office hours schedule and holiday schedules and managing conference table and meeting space reservations.
Supporting the GPSS Secretary in preparation and management of GPSS Senate and Executive Committee meetings. Tasks include roster updates, ordering food/snacks for meetings, meeting set-up, meeting clean-up, and other duties as assigned.",cxqsup,udub

Hiring On-campus Weekend Job,13,0,"City Grind Espresso in Henry Art Gallery (on campus!) is hiring a barista for weekend shifts. We are the only independently owned cafe on campus. Our ideal barista has at least one year of food-service experience, preferably some of it making coffee. You should have a love for exceptional coffee and want to make great coffee drinks every time. You need to have a friendly, outgoing demeanor with a good sense of humor, and an ability to work independently. Solid barista skills are a strong plus. A willingness to tackle the less-glamorous, behind-the-scenes tasks required of being a barista with thoroughness is required. We are hiring someone who will work Saturday and Sunday 10:30 am- 3:30 pm. The shifts are generally pretty quiet so you'll have an opportunity to get some homework done but customers will come first and of course, there is some side work. We start at $15.00/hour and all the coffee you can drinks on shift!

If interested, please email citygrindespresso at gmail or stop in the cafe with a resume.

About City Grind Espresso

City Grind Espresso has been operating within the same two blocks of 5th Avenue in downtown Seattle for more than 20 years. In June 2016, we opened a small cafe in Henry Art Gallery on the University of Washington Campus. We believe that a strong community is the basis of everything we all do, so City Grind strives to be a focal point for ours. In practice, this means creating a comfortable environment where anyone and everyone can enjoy a great beverage, a tasty bite to eat or simply soak in the light streaming in the giant floor-to-ceiling windows at City Hall or discuss the impact of the latest exhibits at The Henry.",cz80qn,udub

Gov Inslee's talk on campus On climate change / any classes on climate science on campus?,15,10,"Hey all,

today I was listening to a climate change panel attended by Gen Cheney, Adm Fallon, Gov Inslee, Gov Whitman. 

I'm particularly drawn to the part of the talk where national security issues and climate change refugee issues are discussed.

The goal of the night is to enjoy and explore the new game, and the competitive focus will be toned down compared to usual. Feel free to drop in if you want to try the game out or meet some of the region's top players.

We're expecting the event to be pretty crowded, so you want to make sure you have an in when you get there just send me a DM or ask someone who looks like they know what they're doing for Aias the Shulk player. I'll be bringing my own setup and will hook you up with a controller and make sure you get some games in if you tell me you came from Reddit.

Hope to see you there!

Edit: Our TO posted in the comments with more details about the event. Make sure to check it out!

"As an older alumni, I would like to hear from current FSU students how they feel about the racial climate on campus.",3,12,"I want to start off by saying I am glad the fsuacb website was shut down. It was toxic and symptomatic of a much larger racial undertone. I would see the n word used and all types of hate. I did enjoy some of the drama between frats and sororities and all the roasting of each other on the website. Greek life is still mostly segregated on campus all though I have maybe 7 black friends in all or mostly white fraternities. The statue of a slave apologist being proposed to be taken down was a sign of progress to me. 

I grew up in an upper middle class area of Tallahassee on the north side. The racism is mostly under the surface instead of overt. Growing up and even now in my current residence white people would stop in the street if I was outside my house to see if I really lived there. I've had the police called and accused of breaking in my own g35. Some white neighbors are pleasant. Others wouldn't speak if you waved. I get angry glares as they drive by and see black affluence. 

FSU hasn't been desegregated as long as people think. There are still remnants and aftershocks and growing pains within our university. Over all the FSU community supports each other regardless of race. We are all seminoles. I would like to hear from students of all ethnicities about the current racial climate. ",b35ftz,fsu

Have You Ever Graffiti'd on Campus? (Narratives Project),12,6,"Hi All, 

I am attempting to focus a school-project on the kinds of graffiti students have made on campus, and the ""stories"" behind them. I am looking for specific stories behind these graffiti pieces we've made as students. Whether that's detailing how boring a class was and that's why you doodled on the desk in front of you, or something more intricate like to you and your freshman-sweetheart carving your names in brick. The project will be presented in still-images with voice-overs.

 If you feel comfortable in answering anonymously, please DM or comment below your answers to these questions (if you'd like to have an in-person recording that would be awesome as well! You would still remain anonymous in the project):

1. What did you draw/write? (If you have/can take a photo that would be great to send me) 
2. Where? (as specifically as possible so I can find it and take a photo of itself and the setting surrounding it) 
3. Why  did you draw/write it? What was the reason? What meaning is behind it that no one would know just on looking at it? (ex. Boredom during class - was it the subject, discussion, or teacher-, you wanted to make a memory with a friend, or you thought it was cool ‚Äì add  specifics to these answers please!) 
4. (Optional answer, for accurate voice-over of your answers) Male or Female?

A warning about using the new Pace Bike-sharing service on campus.,19,6,"For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, you've probably seen some white bikes with baskets on the front sprinkled in bike racks around school. These bikes are managed by an app that allows you to rent them for short periods of time before parking them at any other bike rack. The app uses bluetooth to lock and unlock the bikes with an electronic system mounted to each one.

If anything happens when you are riding a bike and you can't lock it back, even if it is something *not your fault*, you are held liable for the bike until you can get it locked somewhere again. If your phone dies and you cannot lock the device again, you *will* be charged the normal time-rate until you can get the device secured. 

I just had to call their support line because I couldn't get the bike to go into locking mode to end my ride. I did all the normal troubleshooting before calling and couldn't get it to work. While doing some more troubleshooting with the rep and becoming late for my class, the rep let me know that I would be liable for *any and all damage* that would come to the bike until I could get it locked. When I asked what I could do if the troubleshooting didn't work, she told me that I would need to keep the bike with me and wait until their engineers were able to solve my issue. No discussion about compensation for my time/still being charged the regular time-rate happened. Even positioning that this was not my issue, it was with their system, they told me I would remain liable.

Most importantly, **the support line has no way to manually lock a bike from their end. The only possible way to interact with a lock is through local bluetooth.**

This is a startup that has not thought things through when it comes to the technology they use. Take caution in using their service. It's great for what it is, but incredibly unforgiving if something goes wrong.",7pyqcn,fsu

There's a man on campus running a money scam,99,28,"Some people here might already be familiar with this guy, but I'm writing this post to give a general warning so that you don't get naively scammed out of money like I was today.

A well dressed Caucasian man in brown khakis who goes by the name ""Will"" has been for at least two years apparently walking around Oakland, Shadyside, and the surrounding area scamming people into giving him money. He claims to be part of a law firm and invents a story that he's been locked out of his car. Asking for around $10-$20, he mentions needing to pay a locksmith and promises to ""triple"" whatever you give him. His conversation starts off with him asking for directions and than transitions into needing money.

He approached me today at 1:45pm when I was walking down North Craig Street in front of St. Paul's Cathedral and told me this story. It was raining, I wasn't really paying attention, and he seemed professional, so I give him $20 foolishly thinking that I'd be repaid. He told me to wait and that he would be back in 15 minutes. I gave him my number and from his cellphone he called me so he'd be in my contacts. His number was 412-613-2054, but he does not reply to texts and it goes immediately to voicemail. It may be a burner number.

From a forum post I've read on Nextdoor of other people mentioning being scammed by him, this is the general description that matches what I saw:

-Caucasian

-Brown hair

-Roughly 5'11'' and 180 lbs

-Brown khakis

-Buttoned down shirt with tie

-Leather shoes

-May or may not wear a long coat

-Repeatedly mentions that he's a lawyer, talks very fast to catch you off guard

I will be reporting what happened to me on Monday to campus police. Apparently he's been reported on before, so I'm doubtful that this will do much. It's my own fault for not paying attention and it should serve as a lesson to be more careful about being accosted by strangers on Pitt campus. At the very least, I hope that an alert goes out so that more are aware of this scam that he's running.

If anyone here can provide further information, it would be greatly appreciated.",c9p8ld,Pitt

"Biking on Campus (for new and returning students, alike)",25,24,"As someone who bikes and drives around campus, I've seen things from both sides of the coin and just thought I'd get my word out/vent a bit.

**Biking**

You're not a pedestrian.  (You are a vehicle and should carry on as one.  Red lights, stop signs, etc. all apply to you. Thanks /u/Pyyii)  Technically, you shouldn't be on sidewalks, cars don't drive on sidewalks, though to say I've never done it would be a blatant lie.  There are times I feel unsafe on streets and will hop onto sidewalks until I am more comfortable.  While on the sidewalk though, remember that you're the outsider.  This isn't your territory.  Here, you should ride at pedestrian speed and proceed as you would as if you were walking.  Better yet, hop off your bike and wheel it along until you feel safe re-entering the streets.

While on the streets, it's generally understood that you can't keep up with the flow of traffic (especially on 5th as traffic there can move quickly), but it is expected that you make a conscious effort to keep moving.  Don't coast or cruise along as you would on a relaxing afternoon ride.  Why spend longer than you must on the chaos that is 5th?

Additionally, SIGNAL!  NHTSA standardized hand signals can be found [here](http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/8009-HandSignals.pdf)  (2MB direct PDF download from NHTSA).  Given this, I would estimate that most full-time drivers don't recall this from their driving test at the age of 16 or so.  A simple left arm/right arm to show where you're going can help a lot.

And for your own good, yield to aggressive or uneducated drivers.  Remember, it's entirely possible to be right AND dead.  Cars weigh ~15-25 times more than you and your bike.  The biker usually loses.  

Branching from this, please don't shoot across cross walks simply because pedestrians have the right-of-way to walk.  Drivers gauge their turns across cross walks based upon nearby pedestrians.  When you come flying through many times faster, it's often impossible to see you coming because, remember, you're not anticipated.  In this case, it's entirely possible to be dead AND wrong.  A double loss.

Finally, lights.  Use some sort of a light from the moment it begins to become darker.  The more visability the better, IMO.  The bike shop on S. Bouquet undoubtedly sells lights as I'm sure Target and Dick's do (at the Waterfront). The reflectors on your bike are probably there due to some legal mumbo-jumbo and not as a cure-all for drivers seeing you at night.

Late addition:  Learn what the all-white painted bikes mean and notice them. [Ghost Bikes of Pittsburgh](http://ghostbikes.org/ghostbikemap/Pittsburgh)

**Driving**

As a driver, when you see someone biking on the streets, the are a vehicle, too.  They are entitled to a lane just as much as you are.  Don't attempt to pass on single lane roads unless there's AMPLE space (4+ feet is a rough rule of thumb) and/or the rider has waved you past.  Like I wrote above, you weight ~15-25 times more than the biker + bike and that person will lose the collision.

Though less common but still a concern of bikers, drivers and passengers need to open doors carefully into traffic.  A biker will yet again lose that collision.  You're opening a door into traffic, as bikes constitute ""traffic"".  Just like opening a door into traffic, yield to bikes when entering traffic whether it be while turning or leaving a parking space.

Could possibly include open bartering (i.e. - ""will trade a meal at XYZ for a ride from station to Oakland"").  Simple crowd-sourcing kind of implementation, plus an interesting way to meet people and do some good for fellow students.

* Puppy rentals.  I know the university does the ""therapy dogs"", but imagine being able to rent a puppy for an hour and play with it.  C'mon, you know that sounds like fun.  (Note:  Looks like this [already exists](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/03/jenna-miller-byu-student-puppies-for-rent_n_2232657.html) at a school out west)

* Strip club.  Jager bombs.  Yup.  (Because obviously this would succeed off of only college kids with all our money... >.>)


Just wanted to get some creative conversation going while I sit here waiting for my internship to end so I can go binge drink to certain death with everyone else who's finally back in Oakland.  Who knows, maybe you'll find out what you've always wanted already exists...

Cheers and Happy Move-In to those of you coming back.

Multi-Level Marketing Encounters on Campus,29,35,"Hello Badgers,

Recent alum here. I am doing research for a story covering multi-level marketing companies on college campuses. Have any of you (current students or alumni) come in contact with anyone who wants ""just five minutes of your time"" to offer ""an amazing business opportunity?"" During my undergraduate studies (2013-2017), on multiple occasions, I have seen nicely-dressed students prowling Union South trying to reel students in.

Although not technically illegal or considered a ""pyramid scheme"", multi-level marketing companies ride a line between being an opportunity and a scam. For financially vulnerable populations like college students, these companies' methods of recruitment-for-profit become much more enticing and potentially damaging. I hope this story may shed some light on MLMs practices, their questionable motivations, and how students can spot them and help others from getting sucked into their trappings.

Any thoughts or experiences you wish to share are greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Collection of all known information re: Swat Team on campus,37,8,"This is what is understood so far. A swat unit pursued two suspects, who pulled over and fled on foot through campus from nearby the union/footbridge area. Both suspects arrested, one outside the DCC in an area still populated by students, by swat agents in prepared, military style gear, wielding assault rifles, assisted by K9 units. 

This was reportedly related to an arrest of 4 people (unclear if inclusive of the two who fled in the direction of campus, but likely) at a residential spot on 15th. 

The amount of prepared police presence and equipment indicates a planned raid of individuals expected to be armed and dangerous. The incident is suspected to be drug-related, possibly of several major dealers in the area. 

Only after the arrests were completed was RPI able to send out an alert, simply referring to a traffic stop followed by foot pursuit rather than the prepared swat raid followed by a chase through campus involving armed SWAT officers as caught on camera.",dijrkq,RPI

Save RPI Greek Life: Seeking Leaders on Campus,38,0,"**We need you!**

Hello everyone! After next semester, many of our members will be moving on to graduate school or senior year of college. Save RPI Greek Life is seeking students, Greek or non-Greek, to continue advocating for the Greek community and necessary reforms on campus. If you are interested, please reach out to our group at [saverpigreeklife@gmail.com](mailto:saverpigreeklife@gmail.com). For more information on our platform, please check out [https://savegreeklife.xyz](https://savegreeklife.xyz). You can also DM us on Reddit.

&#x200B;

**What RPI has done so far**

\- Banned alcohol and social events with alcohol from Greek organizations and imposed strict, two year suspensions for those that violate policy.

\- Eliminated the SPAM program (peer monitoring for Greek parties)

\- Created an arbitrary recruitment checklist and restrictions on recruitment without consulting students

\- Required administrative approval for all rush events as well as documented justification for the events

\- Misrepresented the Greek community in a negative manner that has affected recruitment and campus image

\- Banned recruitment for the Fall semester, then altered course and deferred recruitment until midterms. This affected the abiliy of many students to participate in rush and recruitment

\- Associated Greek housing conditions with mental health issues and stated that Summer Arch is a ""core issue"" with Greek Life

&#x200B;

**What we have accomplished so far**

\- Reached and sustained communication with thousands of alumni through social media, email, and phone calls to make them aware of RPI's recent sanctions against Greek Life. Hundreds of alumni called and sent letters to RPI as a result.

\- Obtained large amounts of data on Title IX, 990s/other financial data on Greek houses, meetings, and other information from our supporters.

\- Reached out to local media and recieved press coverage regarding RPI's Greek sanctions.

\- Distributed shirts on campus and placed posters during campus events (we also documented the widespread and expedient removal of our posters by RPI Public Safety).

\- Reached an active social media presense of over 2,500 students and alumni through our group and associated social media accounts (does not include official Greek Life social media). Maintain an alumni mailing list with over 100 dedicated alumni.

&#x200B;

**What else can be done?**

\- **Making our group more relevant.** Besides outreach and communication, we have not held any public events on campus. We need students that can gather support, network, and work closely with other student groups to plan public events and advocate for the Greek community.

\- **Fostering unity within the Greek system.** Save RPI Greek Life has been banned or heavily discouraged within numerous Greek organizations and only members from around half of Greek organizations have been involved. We want to expand our impact and make Save Greek Life a well respected student-run advocacy group for the Greek system.

\- **Spreading the word on campus.** We need to make sure that campus is continually postered next semester. (We will be sharing new posters on Reddit before the start of the semester).

\- **Reinventing what we do.** A lot has happened to the Greek system within the past semester. If you want to get involved, know that any students and alumni are welcome. We are not a radical group and we are looking forward to getting more people involved on campus!

RPI-Forge: An on-campus Makerspace with 3D printers and a Laser Cutter available to all RPI Students,33,8,"Hello Everyone!

As the semester begins to spool up I want to tell you about the RPI Forge. The Forge is a student run club that is open to all members of RPI, regardless of year or major. We are located in **CII 2037** (Take the spiral staircase in the DCC and make a right) and have 6 3D printers and 1 laser cutter. We have been open since 2016 but we are now able to handle a larger volume of students.

One of the goals of the Forge is to provide a makerspace to the students at RPI with volunteers who are able to help anyone use the machines provided. There is no experience necessary and our volunteers will help you understand the ins and outs of any machine you want in a few minutes. Another goal is to provide a space to collaborate with a conference table and a smart board.

There is a $10 membership fee to join and we only charge for materials used after that (ie. Plastic spools for the 3D printers) However, if you bring your own materials, there are no charges after that. We support most types of ABS and PLA spools. The laser cutter is free to use after paying the membership fee.

If you would like to sign up, [please use this link](https://goo.gl/forms/AW2lmUOcSgeKAo713)

**We will be opening at the beginning of next week (1/22/18)** and we are hosting a General Body Meeting on 2/9/18 at 4:15 (room TBD) for all prospective members.

[Our hours of operation can be found here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=azJyNm9zamptczZscXQ0MWJpNWE3ajQ4bjBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). Make sure to go to next week. We will be adding more hours as we get more volunteers. If you volunteer at least one hour a week to helping out in the forge you will receive key card access that works from 9am to 9pm on weekdays. 

We look forward to working with you! I'll periodically check this thread to answer any questions you have. You are also free to show up to the Forge in person to ask any questions or email us at rpi.forge@gmail.com",7rekqi,RPI

I visited the counseling center throughout the spring semester and the tips that I received were somewhat helpful but I don't feel like I'm going to really get anything else out of  future sessions.

I emailed her about scheduling the first meeting, and explained the above to her ^. I've had pain since February so she's seen me with my cane and everything.

I really really don't want to bother her too much, but I also dread taking the walk to the building (even if I manage to take the 144), and the stairs at the front of the building, and the stairs to get to the basement. 

TLDR, are there any rooms on campus that would be relatively quiet/private, that I could possibly ask this professor to meet me at? I adore my prof and again, really don't want her to go out of her way. The issue is the only place I could think of was McLennan/a room in a library, but that feels kind of indignant for a prof?? I have no idea. I'm finally beginning to take my pain seriously, but I don't want to hurt my relationship with her or cause her any inconvenience. So any suggestions for accessible/appropriate locations would be greatly appreciated. <3 ",8hi1l2,mcgill

Email from Provost Manfredi about sexual violence/misconduct on campus,26,1,"> Dear McGill students, faculty and staff,
>  
> Since my message of 10 April 2018, I ‚Äì along with many other members of McGill‚Äôs senior administration ‚Äì have had numerous discussions with members of our community about campus sexual violence and sexual misconduct. While these conversations have not been easy, they have been critical to deepening our understanding of this matter, and to our growth as a community committed to a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for all.
> 
> Concerns expressed in recent weeks have focused on the importance of establishing a clearly identified site, outside of any Faculty, for reporting incidents of sexual misconduct and sexual violence. They have also centred on questions concerning intimate relationships between teaching staff and students. To address these concerns, we will take the following immediate steps:
>  
> First, McGill will appoint a special investigator responsible for receiving and investigating all reports of sexual violence or sexual misconduct. The special investigator will be at arm‚Äôs length from the relevant disciplinary authority in any given case (e.g., Faculty Dean or Dean of Students). The special investigator will be in office by Fall 2018.
>  
> Second, an ad hoc committee will be struck to examine and make policy recommendations on the issue of intimate relationships between teaching staff and students. This committee‚Äôs mandate and composition ‚Äì which will include strong student representation ‚Äì will be presented for approval at the May 2018 Senate meeting. It will begin its work immediately thereafter and report to Senate within 6 months.
>  
> Third, as requested by the Principal at Senate‚Äôs April 2018 meeting, I have developed Guidelines on Intimate Relationships between Teaching Staff and Students. These Guidelines clarify existing regulations and policies, which will remain in place at least until the work of the ad hoc committee is complete. They remind us of the standards and expectations to which teaching staff are held in their relationships with students. Everyone is urged to read these Guidelines carefully.
>  
> Moving forward, we will update the McGill community regularly about our progress on these and other measures to address campus sexual violence and sexual misconduct. 
>  
> I close with a reminder that, as recognized when McGill adopted its Policy against Sexual Violence in November 2016, the work required to address campus sexual violence and sexual misconduct is necessarily ongoing and iterative. My message then was that we can and must do better. We‚Äôve since worked hard, and taken some important, positive steps. I am especially appreciative of the work of students and of the critical contributions and expertise within the Office for Sexual Violence Response, Support and Education (O-SVRSE).
>  
> Just the same, we can still do more, and we can still do better.

To hell with all these anxious first and second years trying to figure out their McGill careers. As a jaded fourth year, all I want to know is where the best place to read for pleasure is on campus. Here are the things I think make a great place to read:

* **Comfortable slouching**. A comfortable place to get my slouch on is arguably the most important thing when it comes to the perfect reading spot.
* (At least relative) **Silence**. I don't mind a little 'moving around' noise but the incessant conversation of the average McGill student about how hard they're going to fail a class, how desperate they are to get into med school, or how drunk they got on Saturday can be an unpleasant distraction.
* **Atmosphere**. This one's kind of subjective, but it's always nice to read in a place that looks nice and doesn't make you feel like you're breathing the stress coming off of the people around you (*cough* McLennan *cough*).

Some of my personal favorites are the quad and the bench-lined path to the right of the Redpath Museum entrance, which are useless during this season but nice in the fall. Today I tried the group study area in the Redpath building, and while the slouches are both wonderful and abundant, the noise is not great and will only get worse as the semester wears on.

Pro-Chinese Government Propaganda in this Sub and on Campus: Observations and Patterns,323,44,"**Introduction**

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I‚Äôve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China‚Äôs authoritarian government (hereafter, the ‚ÄúCPC‚Äù for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, ‚Äúthe complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,‚Äù involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, ‚Äúthe resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,‚Äù would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, ‚Äúthe retraction of the ‚Äòriot‚Äô characterization,‚Äù ‚Äúthe release and exoneration of arrested protesters,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests‚Äù are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China‚Äôs part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It‚Äôs hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I‚Äôve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China‚Äôs propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don‚Äôt want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users‚Äô arguments. I also don‚Äôt provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality‚Äîwhich will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government‚Äîbecause the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we‚Äôre all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&#x200B;

**Using the term ‚ÄúBrainwashing‚Äù**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term ‚Äúbrainwashing.‚Äù Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? ‚ÄúBrainwashing‚Äù is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China‚Äôs extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren‚Äôt brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government‚Äôs propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.‚Äù Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we‚Äôre on the topic of manipulative terminology, it‚Äôs worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as ‚Äúriots‚Äù and ‚Äúrioters.‚Äù Other tactics, like using ‚Äúwestern values‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù or using ‚ÄúChina‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese people‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthe Chinese government‚Äù get their own sections below. 

&#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn‚Äôt a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don‚Äôt matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors‚Äô demands, the response is usually something like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care either way, because they‚Äôre not going to get their demands met anyway.‚Äù Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors‚Äô demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong‚Äôs fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as ‚Äúwestern‚Äù or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world‚Äôs largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don‚Äôt want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy‚Äîthat people should control and be protected from their own government‚Äîis not incompatible with any culture, it‚Äôs merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don‚Äôt let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn‚Äôt make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It‚Äôs the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. ‚ÄúHow can you be against Nazi‚Äôs marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can you criticize that person‚Äôs remarks? Even if they‚Äôre sexist, what about their freedom of speech?‚Äù

The answer, of course, is not that we‚Äôre against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn‚Äôt mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors‚Äô message**

&

**Focusing on the protestors‚Äô symbols rather than the protestors‚Äô message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors‚Äô message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection‚Äîthe focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I‚Äôm sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one‚Äôs own meaning. But let‚Äôs humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they‚Äôve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don‚Äôt know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors‚Äô use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don‚Äôt let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard that much about it, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn‚Äôt surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. ‚Äúthe government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other‚Äù). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur‚Äôs own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We‚Äôve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don‚Äôt persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn‚Äôt have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we‚Äôre that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don‚Äôt give them an inch of respect, because they aren‚Äôt giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it‚Äôs abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, ‚Äúwhy would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?‚Äù

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren‚Äôt the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren‚Äôt these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn‚Äôt invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven‚Äôt actually made a case for why they shouldn‚Äôt be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn‚Äôt land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China‚Äôs economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China‚Äôs economic growth over the past few decades. Let‚Äôs breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that‚Äôs a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let‚Äôs take a look at the causal claim that China‚Äôs growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China‚Äôs growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it‚Äôs not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn‚Äôt surprising. The question isn‚Äôt why it‚Äôs doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we‚Äôre talking about growth rate, sure it‚Äôs high, but it‚Äôs easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China‚Äôs government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

I just thought there must be some like minded people on campus who disapprove of what these people are doing.

Looking for UCD on-campus housing Transfers interested to join SHA group,5,6,"Hello, as the post says, I made a SHA group for an on-campus housing. 

For now I‚Äôm just searching for people who are interested in rooming together as I need to read more into the process.

About me, I‚Äôm a Neurobio, physio, and behavioral major transfer who is currently striving towards medical school (possibly pharmacy or PA if things don‚Äôt pan out). My favorite shows include Psych, Brooklyn 99, Rick & Morty, and Planet Earth II. I feel like I‚Äôm just above average cleanliness, and just below average socialness starting at a new school. Likely will try to spend most of my time studying, and doing some school extra currics.And I actually haven‚Äôt visited the Davis campus yet.

Looking for others in the same pre-med boat, but not a requirement. Other desired qualities: relative cleanliness, not super loud past 2am, and some interest in going to the gym.

I would also love any feedback from the veteran UCD redditors about housing or tips for transfers coming to UCD in general!",bnw8at,ucdavis

Have you ever felt lonely on campus before? I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences,43,22,"Over this semester, I‚Äôve had a fair number of conversations with a professor of mine about, generally speaking, about building social relationships on campus. Part of this was fueled by my own sense of loneliness; I‚Äôve struggled with paralyzing levels of social anxiety that makes it hard to function in unfamiliar social situations, so I‚Äôve tended to shy away from them even though I know it would be in my best interest to form social connections during my time as a student here. However, what also struck me was how he claimed a lot of people on campus knew how I felt, how they felt just as lonely as I did. It felt tragic, that there were so many lonely people on campus who would love to meet others who could understand how they felt, but no clear avenue to meet them.

I know how I‚Äôve handled this sense of loneliness in the past: I retreated to the Internet. For me, it was a way I could interact with people without taking in too much stimuli that overwhelmed me in face-to-face scenarios. I only had to react to somebody‚Äôs written words, and when I felt comfortable enough to voice-chat with somebody, their voice. I felt comfortable expressing my inner thoughts, my fears and insecurities, when I was able to hide behind a computer screen. In person, I was too afraid to break through the walls of empty platitudes that my professor calls ‚Äúautistic friendliness‚Äù (a rigid predisposition to be friendly; personally not the biggest fan of the term). I‚Äôve made some amazing friends, several of whom I‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting in real life despite living states apart, and who I love like siblings.

But in real life, all I can do is pretend to smile and be polite when I meet somebody new. The fear of rejection is so strong, I use ‚Äúautistic friendliness‚Äù as a shield. What if somebody thinks I‚Äôm pathetic for being such a social loser? What if somebody thinks I‚Äôm not desirable as a friend? As much as I love my online family, I need to find healthy offline relationships as well. I know a lot of people on campus would relate to my experiences. I remember being able to have a conversation about this with somebody one time, who confessed they wished they could wear a big ‚Äútalk to me‚Äù sign on campus because they felt the same way.

I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs anybody here on this subreddit who‚Äôs felt similarly or has had similar experiences on campus. I know how hard it is to be able to express this offline, but I hope asking this online may give some people the courage to answer more honestly. I hope hearing others who feel the same way can help both others, and myself, find confidence.",bebvhc,ncsu

1.How much are we gonna charged per day during the time we live in Syme22? Or we simply don‚Äôt need to pay during hurricane.
2.If it does charge us, is it going to charged from Sep, 12th or the day the actually moving in?

Same goes if you hate how the only drink you can get from the vending machines are the super unhealthy Coca Cola drinks at $2 a pop!

Provost Joan Gabel from UNC is the presidential finalist and UNC has the same policy in place where meal plans are mandatory and supplied by Aramark while they have an exclusivity contract with Pepsi. See if she has a plan to do something different.

Bring up how you care about University Dining Services becoming independent!

Help us get a president that cares about the things that peeve us off!

The venue is in the Coffman Theatre tomorrow, Monday the 10th at 10:00-10:45 for the open house and 10:45-noon for the forum.  

Edit: Provost Gabel is from USC, not the northern one, but USC uses Aramark and Coca Cola. It would be more accurate to say Aramark and Coca Cola uses USC (abuses would be the most accurate).  

I appreciate how everyone else is also a bit pissed that we've been forced to drink sugary diabetes inducing poison while getting gouged for it for the past several years.

- No cleaning of bathrooms

- No replaced items in bathrooms (e.g., soap, towels, etc.); which items are not offered?

- Garbage disposal; in the dorms employees would come and take out the trash, is that still offered, or is it on the tenants of the suite?

PSA: Apparently there is a sex trafficking ring active on campus,72,22,"From one of my professors:

 Hi everyone! A few weeks ago a student told me that she was approached on campus here at LSU by a couple asking her to worship with them and when she looked up where the service was supposed to be, the place didn't exist. She later found out that this is a common sex trafficking tactic that is occurring on campuses around the country.

A student in our class emailed me this morning to tell me that the same thing happened to her sister on campus yesterday and that there are additional students who have experienced this, too.

So please, stay vigilant, and if this happens to you or one of your friends please file a police report ASAP. I spoke with LSU PD this morning and they are aware that this is going on broadly, but they need help with immediacy so that these people can be identified. Please stay safe!

A Documentation of the Best Places to Shit on Campus (Men's Restrooms),186,87,"Unfortunately, this record can only contain reviews on places I have shit, therefore, expect several edits to this post. If you have your own reviews of halls not listed, please add to the archive.

Student Union - Second Floor: Serves its purpose. Not particularly awful, but not exactly an eye-opening experience either. 5/10

Allen Hall - First Floor: Smells kind of funny, and looks like it holds the chamber of secrets. The stalls are dark, but hey, maybe you're into that kind of thing. The backpack hooks work just fine, and the doors lock, which is more than can be said for most places. The toilet paper is awful though. 7/10

Patrick F. Taylor - Any are good honestly: An unforgettable experience. The stalls are clean and all lock properly, lighting is good, all the backpack hooks don't cause the door to swing open like other places, and I swear the toilet paper is actually decent quality. The fact that there are several bathrooms here only adds to the magnificence. My personal favorite is the one near Panera Bread. 10/10.

Middleton Library - First Floor: A strange experience. Only some of the stall doors lock, and the whole place looks like a news headline waiting to happen. The toilet paper is the same shitty paper from Allen, though at least the bathroom is usually quiet. 3/10

Tureaud Hall - First Floor: A nice, clean, quiet place to shit. the stall doors lock in my experience. The thing of greatest concern is that a few of the stalls have glory holes, but hey, who doesn't love a neighborly chat through the glory hole while you and your boys shit? 9/10

Lockett Hall - First Floor: A nightmarish hellscape. The restroom is filthy, none of the stall doors lock, the toilet paper has the strength of freeze-dried kleenex, and the stalls appear to have been designed for tiny gremlins. To top it all off, the toilets soak you with a waterfall of water when you flush. It also has a weird massive urinal that looks more like a bathtub. 0/10

Edit: Coates Hall now included

Coates Hall - First Floor: Have you ever been in a 7/11 at midnight, and experienced how off the place is? That's what this bitch feels like at 7:30 in the morning, just a toxic air of unholiness about it. The stalls are pretty massive, which is a huge plus, but the door of the handicap stall often blocks the path to the urinals, so you have to play a minigame to access your piss bucket. The mirrors and sinks are in pretty rough shape and the toilet paper is plentiful. I was unable to locate the glory holes in the bathroom, much to my disappointment. 6/10

Edit 2: The floors I am reviewing have been clarified, and I have added a few more

Williams Hall - First Floor (Female Restroom, Not my experience): The main door is reportedly always open, and there are only three or four stalls. They share many of the same designs of Lockett stalls. The overall room is tiny, it smells weird,, the lighting isn't bad and it is usually pretty clean. Toilet paper sucks, as per usual. Even the handicap stall is small, so expect no saving grace, and the doors are a disgusting orange color. 5/10.

Student Union - First Floor (Unisex), across from McDonalds: One of the first bathrooms I ever used on campus, so forgive my inevitable nostalgia bias. It is a single person bathroom, which is always welcome, and the room is fairly well lit. The restroom isn't exactly the cleanest, and again, the toilet paper sucks, but its what you gotta do to get some privacy around here. The walls are pretty thin, so don't blow it up too hard if you don't want stares and/or cheers when you exit. 8/10

Help brainstorming a name for my new organization on campus!,0,0,"Hey Tigers!

A few girls and I are starting a new organization on campus. As of right now we are using the name Tiger Sweethearts, however, if we can think of a more original creative name we would love to use that instead.

The club/ organization will be a sisterhood that is dedicated to philanthropy and scholarship. I understand many Greek Sororities on campus also concentrate on this, however the Tiger Sweethearts will be for girls who would like to do volunteer work for the community as well as better themselves with their ""sisters"" without having to go to an exchange every week.

There will be a rush process but it will be entirely based off of GPA, a single paper for the girl to explain how she can contribute to the organization, and just three rush events. Nothing will be based on appearance and the members will be forbidden from saying anything negative about the girls they are rushing.

The philanthropy is to better the state of Louisiana and the community of Baton Rouge. Every interest and major will have a volunteer opportunity catered to them. We have the Garden Project in Baton Rouge, Volunteer Health Corps, Brave, and many other local organizations to work with. The Tiger Sweethearts will be making opportunities available to the sisters through planned (optional) volunteer projects.

Scholarship wise we will be providing opportunities for girls to meet with other people in their majors, form study groups, trade notes with people who have already taken the class, and more group oriented opportunities such as guest speakers from graduate schools and different careers. We will be working hard to help every girl excel in school.

This organization is meant to foster a feeling of community and will work with the ""pay it forward"" idea of helping others. Kindness will be expected and drama and cruelty will not be tolerated.

The officers and I still need to complete the full constitution for the organization, but if anyone is interested, please send me an email! We still have openings for the founding leadership positions!

TL;DR If anyone could help me brainstorm a name for a sisterhood focused on community philanthropy, scholarship, and kindness, please let me know your ideas!",1oasxb,LSU

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Indiana University and state and local health officials are investigating a confirmed case of measles on the Bloomington campus. Public health officials are working to track down those potentially exposed to measles during the period from the student‚Äôs travels to Bloomington on Jan. 2 until the student‚Äôs diagnosis and self-isolation on Jan. 6. This student, a resident of the McNutt Residence Hall, arrived before the start of the semester to participate in new student orientation.
 
The university is working with the Monroe County Health Department and the Indiana State Department of Health to identify and directly notify anyone who may have been in close contact with the student and to implement measures to help prevent the additional transmission of the virus. 
 
Measles is a serious disease, which in extreme cases can lead to hospitalization and even death. It is extremely contagious among the unvaccinated. However, most students, faculty and staff at IU -- and most residents of Indiana -- have received necessary vaccinations or are already immune to measles. Students at Indiana University are required to have two doses of the MMR vaccine -- and the documentation to prove it -- before enrolling for their second semester of classes. If you need a measles vaccination, contact your primary-care provider or the IU Health Center. If you have been exposed to the infected student and require a vaccine, it will be provided through a partnership between the university and the Indiana State Department of Health.
 
Measles is caused by a virus so is not treatable with antibiotics, but the same hygiene practices that can help prevent the spread of influenza and other contagious diseases can help prevent the spread of measles.
 
""Frequent handwashing throughout the day and sneezing or coughing into tissues or your elbow help prevent the spread of many serious communicable diseases, including measles,"" said Dr. Diana Ebling, medical director at the IU Health Center. ""This is particularly important in classroom and shared living and dining spaces.""
 
Measles facts:
 
* Two doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine are about 97 percent effective against measles. If you are unsure of your vaccination records, check with your primary-care provider. Even a single dose of MMR up to 72 hours after exposure to someone with measles can prevent it or greatly reduce symptoms.

* Health authorities declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world. 
 
Students with symptoms should stay home, isolate as much as possible and call before going to the IU Health Center at 812-855-5002 during office hours or 812-855-4011 after hours. 
 
If students have any concerns about possible symptoms, they should contact the IU Health Center or their primary-care provider.
 
More information is available at https://protect.iu.edu/environmental-health/public-health/communicable-diseases/measles.html. The federal Jeanne Clery Act requires the university to notify the campus community about this measles case.

Mumps cases on campus,19,2,"Just got an email regarding a few mumps cases reported on campus, here's a friendly reminder to wash your hands frequently and get to the doctor's office if you feel that you might be coming down with anything serious.



*From the email*

Indiana University is investigating a cluster of mumps cases on the Bloomington campus. Five total cases have been confirmed since December.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mumps cases nationwide are at a 10-year high, with 46 states reporting cases in the last year. IU is taking all precautions to protect its students, faculty and staff, including offering immunization to potentially exposed persons.

The university is working with the Monroe County Health Department and the Indiana State Department of Health to identify and directly notify anyone who may have been in close contact with the students. They also are implementing measures to help prevent the additional transmission of mumps. Additionally, IU advises that the campus and surrounding community educate themselves about the symptoms, transmission and prevention of mumps.

‚Ä¢ According to the CDC, symptoms for the mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. Mumps is spread from direct and indirect contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets, which can be transmitted by sneezing and coughing. People with mumps can spread their infections for up to two days before and five days after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, anyone with symptoms should stay home and avoid others to prevent the further spread of illness.

‚Ä¢ Mumps is caused by a virus, so antibiotics are not indicated. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection but can range from 12-25 days. Generally, mumps is a mild illness, and some people may not have any symptoms. While complications and more serious issues can result from a mumps infection, they are generally rare, with a 1 percent to 3 percent complication rate.

The university encourages university members to check their vaccination records with their primary-care provider. Currently, the best way to prevent mumps is to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR. Two doses of vaccine are only considered around 88 percent effective at preventing infection, so some people who have been fully vaccinated with two MMRs may still contract mumps.

‚Ä¢ Practicing good hygiene habits -- such as regularly washing your hands with soap and water, sneezing and coughing into a tissue or your elbow, and avoiding the sharing of drinks, food and utensils -- is a good way to prevent illness and transmission.

‚Ä¢ Students with symptoms -- even if they have received a MMR vaccine -- should stay home and immediately call before going to the IU Health Center at 812-855-5002 during office hours or 855-303-2631 after hours.

‚Ä¢ If students have any concerns about possible symptoms, they should contact the IU Health Center or their primary-care provider. Treatment for mumps is geared toward alleviating symptoms. Bed rest, a soft diet and a pain reliever for aches are often recommended.

Again, you should stay away from others if you think you may have mumps.

So me and my sibling (I'm a sophomore, they're a freshman) are signed up to live at Campus View next year, which is an RPS on-campus 2 bedroom apartment.

They call themselves the ""young people revolution"" in order to ride the waves of young people who are actually trying to make changes in our society. The sad truth is that most people who join will lose money or just not make the amounts that they thought they would.

Major Cell Upgrade on Campus,15,13,"Will become active in August.  Will ""guarantee"" full strength coverage on 95% on campus.  Will be carrier agnostic.

Memorial Stadium is to be wired for a maximum capacity of 55k users.

This info is breaking via a video conference going on in the CIB at this moment.  Will update post if any other pertinent information is given.

EDIT:  Basically what is happening is IU will have it's own cellular infrastructure (think IU Secure), which all the carriers will tie into.  There will be antennas placed everywhere on campus, and inside buildings.  The antennas inside buildings will look like smoke detectors.  The exterior antennas will be camouflaged somewhat.  What tlmasonaea said is true.  Not all carriers will be joining this from the start.  From what they said, Verizon will be the first to start on this system, with AT&T and Sprint to follow.  The reasoning is more budgetary than anything else.

The hope is that since a majority of users have data plans, this will take a significant load off of IU Secure.  The single fact that blew me away from this was that the cell phone companies are making a total of 180 million a year in revenue from users associated with IU.",sombj,IndianaUniversity

Get involved on campus this fall! (and a shameless plug for IU Ski and Board),9,8,"Hey Guys! First the advice since I'm sure none of you have any interest in snow or winter in general. If you are a new student on campus this fall (or even an old student), do yourself a favor and get involved in something... anything really! Rush, play a club sport, do something with your residence hall, or within your major. IU is a HUGE school and you can make it so much smaller by joining something your passionate about. You'll meet people with the same passions and have a great time. The one thing I regret is not getting involved on campus sooner than I did. It can be temping to not leave your dorm sometimes, but there are so many options available to you at a school like IU, so take advantage of it. I'm sure some of my other Hoosiers can echo this.

Well I went in to talk about a problem I had with a class and was considering dropping. He was straight up moving his shoulders around and rolling his eyes giving me a whole lot of fever saying, ‚ÄúWhy?? It‚Äôs the last week.‚Äù

Long story short, I gave him the short version of the big situation I was in. He kept cutting me off and therefore didn‚Äôt understand the situation because there was A LOT more than what I mentioned. 

Basically I was worried that I responded to an email from a professor in a rude manner and was afraid it would affect my grade. (Trust me there‚Äôs a lot more to it. But this is all I said.)


He said verbatim, ‚ÄúNo one cares about how you feel‚Äù

Then he brought up my zodiac sign since I guess he saw my birthday on the monitor and said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúSee you‚Äôre a [zodiac sign]. You‚Äôre emotional.‚Äù

Then he continued (almost verbatim), ‚ÄùYou‚Äôre being too emotional and that‚Äôs going to get you in a lot of trouble. You have to learn to control that. You can‚Äôt act or say something based upon your feelings. This is just life advice.‚Äù 

Wtf Miss Cleo, I didn‚Äôt come here for you to read my fortune.

I left saying ‚ÄúThank you for the great advice,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt mean it and I really should have said something about what he told me.

I didn‚Äôt care about what he told me because 1. He makes me uncomfortable to speak to 2. I know who I am 3. You didn‚Äôt even listen to me or take the time to understand the situation.

But you guys...can you imagine if he said this to someone else! Like HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!!! Tell that to the wrong person feeling depressed and you can push them over the edge!!

Indian or Ugandan community groups on campus?,4,12,"Hi fellow Trojans! My name is Tip and I am a Grad student who has started a small project where I have been getting used skateboards to some underprivileged skate communities in India and Uganda. Gathering the gear has been rather easy but shipping is where I am having the most issues. I have some ideas to make this easier and I wanted to see if there might be some groups on campus I can discuss this with. Does anyone know if there are Indian or Ugandan community groups? Uganda might be a long shot but I would imagine there might be an Indian group. Thanks for any input or advice!

Edit: Not sure why the downvotes but maybe I should add some clarity. I am not looking for individuals who are international shipping experts, I am looking for individuals who are going to India or Uganda and might be interested in taking a box of gear. A 30lb box recently cost me $175 through USPS to India and $250 to Uganda. A 50lb on a flight is usually free or max $50. Even if it isn't a USC student going, I was hoping through this that I might get directed to other community groups in the SoCal area that could help. I appreciate the comments so far and just looking to help out skaters who are less fortunate. You can check out the project on instagram @give_skate.",dgm5dd,USC

Best/worst places to poop on campus?,131,44,"I've been compiling a list of good places to poop on campus, and here is my non-exhaustive list:

* The Village. Usually no one in there besides the workers, and there's quilted (yes, quilted) toilet paper. Most toilets on campus only have single, or if you're lucky, 2-ply TP. 
* Fertitta Hall. Lots of stalls and pretty clean. That speaks to the professionalism of our business school. 
* TCC. Similar to Fertitta Hall in its cleanliness and usually not too busy. Worst case is that you have a high school tourist that tries to make conversation about the life on campus at the stall or urinal (makes sense since tours start at TCC). 
* RTH. Very nice floors to look at while sitting on the throne. Usually pretty good except for socially autistic Viterbi students.

The worst places to poop, in my opinion, are:

* KAP. Reminds me of my high school gym's bathroom. Really dated tiles that can be sticky. Has a noticeable stench too. The people that use these toilets usually don't flush. Also, single ply toilet paper (explains the excessive use of TP in each stall).
* Doheny and Leavey. Probably a more personal thing to me, but hearing the various sounds of the bathroom can be disturbing after/while studying in a quiet atmosphere. 


Does anyone care to add to this list?

"The mural about misogyny on campus makes no sense, and IMO, narrow-viewed.",42,83,"Talking about [this](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/43805/). Does it really make sense to say there is misogyny at USC? Women are the majority of both undergrad and graduate students, by a noticeable margin. And which gender has more influence/power? There are far more groups and resources for female students than male students. Think of it this way- a student would be able to start a women's group without any real trouble or opposition. But if someone tried starting a men's issues group, it would likely be protested and shut down very quickly. If only one gender has absolute freedom of assembly and speech, how does it make sense to say that gender is the disadvantaged one? This mural is itself proof- nothing prevented it from going up. I can imagine someone replying to me by saying this post is ""mansplaining"", but really, how does that make sense? The minority group on camous wouldn't even be allowed to start a group for themselves by the majority group- and if they tried, they'd be accused of ""mansplaining.""

Also side note- why say ""dismantle whiteness"" and not ""dismantle racism""? It's as if being white is a bad thing- I know the answer I'd get is something like"" because whiteness is a social construct and a system of oppression"", but really, those long-winded answers and fancy sounding phrases are just made up and mean nothing.",8brd9n,USC

Stolen Husky Spotted On Campus,41,6,"EDIT: BEAR HAS BEEN RETURNED TO HIS RIGHTFUL OWNER! Thank you all so much for your help!

Hi all,

(I'm posting for my significant other who is one of your fellow students)

Yesterday (02/02/17), my SO met a man who had a beautiful, large, pure white husky/wolf dog outside of Wallis Annenberg. The man introduced the dog as ""Bear.""

Cut to today, my SO and I were walking along Exposition when we spotted a LOST DOG sign that featured a photo of beautiful, large, pure white husky/wolf dog named Bear. She had told me about the dog last night so I commented on the missing poster. Just to check, she called the number of the owner and sure enough, the owner had NOT found the dog. 

I just wanted to spread the word so we can help return this animal to its rightful owner! I reported this to campus security but they didn't rush out of their chairs or anything.

**If you see this man and/or dog, please immediately report it to campus security.**

The man with the dog is Hispanic, mid to late 40's, 5'7""ish.

Here is a photo of [Bear](http://imgur.com/a/GelXQ)

Send me a PM if you would prefer to contact me via cell phone as we are currently in contact with the owner.

Some Questions for some MIT Graduate Students,7,15,"Hey guys! I was accepted to a Ph.D. program at MIT with the Chemistry department, but I deferred my enrollment to start Fall 2019. As excited as I am to move from IL to MA, I wanted to be prepared for the transition as well as get some of my questions answered about what to expect when I get there while also help me in my move planning.

1. I've read that bringing my car is essentially useless in the Cambridge/Boston area unless I want an excuse to not drink, but I have a motorcycle I will be bringing with me as I will not have any way to store it and have someone reliable take care of it (i.e. ride it and run it occasionally) during my extended time away from home (plus, I don't want to part with it). Is it possible to pay for a parking permit and have it with me near my dorm in a covered lot/garage for several months? If not, is there any storage facilities nearby campus I can keep it at that you know of? 
2. As an incoming graduate student, how easy was applying and getting graduate housing? I recall reading on the webpage that you need to be fully registered, but, as a new grad student, will registration take place before the application closes for housing? Or is there an exception? Or will I be ultimately stuck rushing to get paperwork in next August when I arrive with my belongings to find housing? I am concerned because I will be funding my entire move only through money I am earning at a full-time job, and I would like gauge how much I should aim to save up.
3. I have the understanding it is nearly unheard of to live on-campus at MIT for more than a few years as a graduate student, but is it possible? Renting near campus without roommates is insane compared to my current rent in the suburbs of Chicago (which can be somewhat pricey still). For those of you who transitioned from on- to off-campus, what suggestions would you have to make it easier? Were you more involved in social events your first year and able to find roommates with friends? How did you find a place? How did you find your roommates?
4. I am looking to visit the area before the visiting weekend in March 2019 since I have never been to MA. Is there any places you would suggest I see or go to? It will likely be on a weekend, so I don't expect to see much relating to the MIT facilities.
5. What is something you like about MIT, and what is something you think could be better? Is there anything I should be mentally preparing myself for?

Beginning July 9, users who are near or exceed the quota will see a notification when they access their MIT Dropbox account warning that they are near or over quota, along with a link to storage reduction tips.

"Culture shift, sadness",48,10,"I‚Äôve been at the Institute for a long time, and I‚Äôve been fortunate in that I‚Äôve worked in different areas of campus (which gives me a broader perspective). I had some interaction with campus in the Chuck Vest era. Today, it feels like MIT‚Äôs culture has shifted significantly since that time.

While it‚Äôs difficult to describe a ‚Äúfeeling,‚Äù MIT seems less quirky and tolerant. There are more layers of bureaucracy, whereas MIT felt more open and a little bit grassroots in the past.

The tenor on campus has also changed. Faculty who used to be known for their warmth and support seem jaded and anxious. MIT has always been hypercritical, but that attitude came from a relentless desire for excellence. It‚Äôs started to feel like we all engage in criticism for the sake of criticism. 

I also miss our culture of service. It used to feel like everyone at MIT was rowing together towards a great, common mission. No matter one‚Äôs role, people took pride in their work and there was less elitism ‚Äî all good work was recognized. It‚Äôs been hard to find people like that now.

I at times wonder how much Presidents and administration impact a place. I‚Äôve heard that there‚Äôs a lot of Harvard influence on campus, due to hires from Harvard into the administration. But I don‚Äôt have anything to really substantiate that.

I feel sad for the culture shift and disappointed that we‚Äôve lost touch with the old MIT. It‚Äôs true that nothing quite stays the same at a place that prides itself on inventing the future. But I didn‚Äôt anticipate a seismic shift in our culture and values.",8phm1v,MIT
Testing different monitors at MIT,4,4,"Hi all,

I'm a new grad student and I need to buy a monitor setup. The thing is, I'm not sure what I want - two 24"" monitors vs one 32"" monitor vs an ultrawide monitor. I was wondering, are there any places on campus I could go to to sort of use these monitors in person and try to figure out what I might like? Black Friday is coming up soon, and I'd love to try some setups before I buy a new monitor. 

Thanks!",9vrzg3,MIT
"MIT is gutting Senior House. All current residents must re-apply to stay there, GRTs are being let go, and the Institute is turning it into freshman housing",134,99,"Full letter going around the sh mailing list:

-------------------------------

From: Cynthia Barnhart <chancellor-reply@mit.edu>
Subject: Sharing the decision on Senior House
Date: June 12, 2017 at 3:05:32 PM EDT
To: <@mit.edu>

Dear ...,
 
I write on behalf of MIT's senior leadership to inform you of our decision and our plans to support you.
 
The turnaround we launched last June engaged you and a number of faculty, staff, and alumni in work to promote personal wellbeing and academic success in your community. As you know, we received credible and concerning information this past semester and launched a review. A few weeks ago, we informed you of our findings that serious and unsafe behaviors and activities occurred in the house during the turnaround. Unfortunately, these behaviors and activities have served to fundamentally undermine our shared goals for the safety, health, and academic success of all Senior House residents.
 
The senior officers and I have met with many of you to discuss this matter, and we have received and read many emails on this topic. Before making our decision, we carefully listened to and reflected on what we heard. I hope that, through this dialogue, you gained an appreciation for the position we are in given our responsibility to provide all students with safe and healthy residential communities.
 

**Decision & Support**
 
We believe that significant change is needed and have made our decision based on our concern and care for present and future residents of the house. The details of our decision are:

All residents who wish to live in Senior House during the 2017-18 academic year must complete an application to be a member of the community. You will see that we are seeking individuals who are committed to contributing to a residential environment that supports residents' academic and personal development.

Because the process will be very selective, many of you will want or need to make alternative housing arrangements for next year. Please know that we are committed to identifying supportive and welcoming options for every member of your community who wishes to live on campus. You can learn more about the relocation process and indicate your housing preferences here. (Also note that, even if you complete a Senior House application, you still need to fill out the housing preferences form so that you can secure a holding assignment while your application is reviewed).

We will work to find you room assignments in other residence halls as either individuals or as part of small groups of friends. Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson has established a relocation team led by Dean David Randall and Associate Director Jen Hapgood-White to provide guidance and support for you throughout this process. If you have questions about another residential community, moving off-campus, dining, financial aid, work study or any other topic associated with moving, they can help starting today. To reach this team, please email residential-support@mit.edu.


**Moving Forward**
 
In addition to students whose applications are approved and the New House students already scheduled to move in while their building undergoes renovations, a cohort of first-year students will reside in the house next year. We are currently developing a program for first-years focused on the personal wellbeing and academic success principles and goals of the turnaround. The program will feature strong faculty and staff engagement as well as opportunities for peer mentorship.
 
While some of you will be disappointed with our decision, I hope you will understand it is firmly rooted in our care for you as students and our concerns about the health and wellness of your residential environment. The senior officers and I are obligated to protect our students' wellbeing and to require accountability when the facts of a serious situation warrant it.
 
We have also worked to respect your privacy and to keep this matter as confidential as we can. We appreciate that you have done the same, and that you have engaged with us throughout the entirety of this process. With a decision now made, we would like to continue to keep what prompted the review and the review's findings private.
 
Please remember that Dean Randall and Associate Director Hapgood-White are ready to help you right now and can be reached at residential-support@mit.edu. Dean Nelson and I are also here for you if you want to talk about the future at any point over the summer.
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Barnhart
Chancellor

What does Senior House / 70 Amherst Street look like now? What is the culture?,13,17,"Hi everyone, 
I am a new incoming graduate student currently evaluating my options for on campus housing preferences. 

I'd like to learn more about what Senior House / 70 Amherst Street looks likes now. I know a little bit about the controversial history of Senior House, but what is the culture of that building today now that it is no longer officially Senior House? Is it just like any other residence hall now? Is it more conventional?

I am asking because I need to choose between this location, or The Warehouse/Syd. Pacific. The location of 70 Amherst is great because all of my classes will be a 5 minute walk away instead of 25 minute walk. Plus, its a little more affordable. If I could learn more about its current culture, I think it would help me in making my decision.

Also, if you have any general advice or feel particularly strongly about any of these housing options, please let me know your thoughts! 

Thanks for your help! ",8ab2cv,MIT

Hacking's silent death,49,12,"A lot of people have criticized the administration's silencing on Senior Haus as the destruction of MIT culture. While an awful and convoluted situation all around, there's a bigger threat to our collective culture and experience, which is the new security restrictions placed on hacking locations. For those of you who are alums/not currently on campus, they have put guards on pretty much every roof access point and are entirely replacing the most common door to small dome. Basically, you need to be able to lock pick now and no combination of hotel key cards and L-slides are effective.

&nbsp;

I feel like this discussion is something that we can only have anonymously (or semi-anonymously) because, by my own admission, hacking is entirely illegal and dangerous. MIT has full moral high ground here.

&nbsp;



But, hacking is such an integral part of the MIT experience that I can't imagine going to school there without it. I never did any of the more dangerous places, and like most people didn't do any of the fun pranks, but some of my best nights were hanging out on top of small dome with friends on a warm autumn night. It's how I got to know many of my friends, and a relatively big reason why I decided to come here.

&nbsp;


Let's talk about the elephant in the room. The cause for this sudden change in policy is Nick Paggi's ('15) untimely death. I was a '15 too, and while I did not know him personally, a lot of close friends were effected and I wish the best for them and his family. But, at the risk of being very insensitive, what he did could only be described as foolish. At best you could say hacking in the rain is ill-advised, let alone doing an incredibly risky move for fun. His death got a lot of press, and the administration is responding to it, which I respect. 

&nbsp;


But I don't think the accident justifies the destruction of a cultural mainstay. Hell, they even use 'hacking' as a main talking point on their student guided tours. The administration has always known that students climb small dome, 66, stata, walker, etc. They have likely caught many people. But, they have always trusted our judgement and turned away. That spoke a lot to how the administration used to treat the students. 

&nbsp;


I just wanted to see what the community thought about this change and open up discussion. Although I may never go hacking again, I feel like such an important aspect of life at MIT is being expunged for the administration to wash their hands of Paggi's death. I don't think that's fair, but I also don't think there's anything we can do about it.

Incoming Freshman and transfer students: Get involved on campus!,47,10,"Yes, college is a time to learn the skills you need for any future careers. But it's also a time where you can meet many different people. The best way to do that is to join a club or attend events on campus. Here's how to do it:

1) Go to ""Cat's Back"". The first week of class during the Fall semester starts the ""Weeks of Welcome"". During this week and a half, the university will have multiple events that are designed to introduce you to the different resources and groups that are on campus. One of those events is ""Cat's Back"". During Cat's Back, a huge number of representatives from different clubs/frats/sororities/intramural teams, etc. will be located in the rec center and a lot of them will be handing out information and possibly signing up members.

2) Go to sporting events. I can't recommend this one enough. Going to a football/basketball/baseball game is a great way to make friends and meet people. Also, don't believe that you shouldn't go to a game alone. You may go into the game alone, but could leave the game with new friends.

3) Look around campus. I've seen people on here complain that there's ""never anything to do on campus"". There's always SOMETHING going on, you just have to put in the effort to find it. No one is going to knock on your door every weekend and tell you what's going on.

Also, try and make an effort to go to at least 3 events on campus. DON'T be that person who's like ""I don't care about sports or doing things with other people. I'm only here to study."" Taking a break from studying won't hurt you. In fact, it can make your studying better.",c8rnqu,UniversityOfHouston

Some Thoughts on Campus Sustainability,70,12,"College students produce an enormous amount of waste especially during move-out season. There‚Äôs a disconnect between what I hear from students at Northeastern about their concern for the environment and what I see when I walk down Columbus Avenue; piles of trash blowing in the wind, keyboards, chairs, a semester‚Äôs worth of Gatorade bottles stuffed into an impressive array of plastic take-out bags. I don‚Äôt want to play any kind of blame game here because the reality is that there is no single group to blame. We are all complicit in this, from the President‚Äôs Office to the bunkers of Steast. There are no winners, we are all losers at the end of the day. What I do want is for students to do what they say and say what they mean. Put your money where your mouth is. If the oncoming climate catastrophe means anything to you, then the hot spell we had in February shouldn‚Äôt be a joke. The plastic bottles that litter our campus shouldn‚Äôt be just part of the scenery, they should be front and center. It‚Äôs depressing to watch a generation of passionate Northeastern students slip into the cycle of single-use plastic waste that we claim to care so much about. 

What I hope Northeastern students will do is look around every once and a while. See what you‚Äôre doing to fight climate change, fight unsustainable living on and off campus, and fight for a culture of environmental compassion at Northeastern. There are so many ways to be better, and I‚Äôm trying everyday to reduce the impact I make. That can start with simple things like eating less meat, walking or biking instead of ridesharing, bringing your reusable bags to the store (any store, not just Trader Joe‚Äôs), and taking shorter showers. It can mean thinking twice before you purchase those double plastic wrapped sandwiches from Outtakes or a pack of plastic water bottles that‚Äôs enveloped in even more plastic.  We have the power to choose how we spend our money (or our swipes or whatever) and there‚Äôs no good reason for us to yell at the administration that we want a more conscientious campus if we are actively feeding into the problem. It‚Äôs not wrong to think that large scale change needs to come from the top, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop us from being better at the bottom.

Recycling seems to me like the wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing. In the holy triumvirate of reduce, reuse, and recycle, one of these things is not like the other. Recycling in Boston is not strong, a lot of recycling is low quality or contaminated and it ends up being shipped abroad to low income countries where it‚Äôs incinerated. There‚Äôs a hidden environmental justice catastrophe lurking underneath the shiny veil of recycling. I hope that Northeastern students (myself included) will learn more about recycling, what it really means and how it really works. [This particularly eye-opening report is a good place to start](https://wastetradestories.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Discarded-Report-April-22.pdf). I again don‚Äôt want to give the impression that I think students are the problem here. I‚Äôve thought for a long time that it would be great if Northeastern taught freshman ‚ÄúLiving Sustainably in Boston‚Äù as part of their major‚Äôs College 101 course. That at least would have been more valuable for me that what I did hear in Biology at Northeastern. I wish I could comment on what Northeastern is really doing for recycling on campus, but unfortunately the system seems pretty opaque to me, and for a university that prides itself on innovation and its green campus, what happens with all the recycling on campus is not very transparent. 

Anyways, I hope that this move-out season goes well for everyone and that we all think about the impact we are having on Boston. Gentrification is an issue, but so is plastification. If you have anything you want to add or point out, feel free. I'm happy to learn from you.",bi17vp,NEU

If you're not on the explorer pass (2 hr rental periods) and do not return it to the docking station within 30 minutes, your credit card will be charged $2.50 per additional 30 minutes.

More importantly, unattended bikes (and other objects of value) get stolen VERY quickly on campus. If you do not lock it with a solid lock (a cable lock does not count), it WILL get stolen. BlueBikes are a favorite amongst the homeless as personal transportation devices.

*If your BlueBike gets stolen and is not returned within 48 hours, you may be charged* ***up to $1,200*** *for it as a lost bike fee!!!*

Please stop leaving them around campus unattended. These are not LimeBikes/AntBicycles and must be returned to a dock. You will cry when you see your credit card statement.

&#x200B;

I was watching videos on campus tours for NU and personal testimonies by students there and I know that I should take everything with a grain of salt because there are all kinds on all campuses but there was one video that DID concern me and it was of a blue haired girl (there are a lot of different blue-haired girl NU videos btw). She was complaining about how the campus promotes rape and the stress levels were unbearable and the psychiatric help provided by administration was crap and campus police are useless and whine whine whine. Fair enough but here's the thing, her comments were by other NU students and they were consoling her affirming that although everything she was saying was true that blablabla. It seems her commenters were agreeing with her albeit trying to calm her.

I wanted to know if this seems normal to everyone; will I be saturated with this kind of b1tching and moaning by snowflakes or is that a rare case? Do you guys see a lot of that kind of radical left complaining and protesting about 'EVERYTHING' or was this example just par for the course as is expected on all campuses?

I think I could handle a bit of it like water off a duck's back but if it's going to be saturated and bombarded by that nonsense then I'll just stick with RPI. I'd appreciate any input, thanks guys.

1. Anybody know what happens when you call that number they have on their website? (I've been trying for six weeks or so but I'm still working on getting past the part where you press ""call"" without immediately hanging up lol. So I thought maybe knowing a bit about it might help)
2. If I ever get to it, where are you supposed to make that ""Brief Screening"" call? There's nowhere private that I've been able to find on campus, and it's not something I really want to do next to my roommate.
3. It sounds like CAPS is mainly intended as a stepping stone‚Äînot for kids who have like a decade of depression/anxiety treatment history‚Äîbut is it still worth it to reach out for a referral to a community provider?
4. Sooo, I've heard different things about their approach to suicidality. Would you recommend just sticking to the hotlines and stuff for that part? (Also want to emphasize that I'm not in danger or anything, I just need to know.)

Thanks a ton to anybody with info.",dqetvz,UVA
Incoming Exchange Student wondering many things,15,13,"hello all

I'm coming to UVA from the UK this spring and I have some questions.

Firstly, what is the average number of classes taken per semester (specifically by juniors majoring in history)? Is it 4 or 5? Are you supposed to aim for 12 credits or 15?

Secondly, re: on-campus housing, what are the best halls to apply for if you're an exchange who won't know anyone? Any good halls for meeting new people and socializing (although not necessarily big alcohol-related parties)?

Thirdly, for any other internationals, I need to travel to UVA from London. What is the best (easiest and least stressful) way of doing this?

Thank you very much",dq7uaf,UVA
Culture at UVA,26,11,"I'm a senior considering applying EA to UVA. I've been doing some research about the school, but I figured it's probably best to come directly to the students here to ask questions :) I'm hoping someone can answer a few questions I have!

Nearly every review on [niche.com](https://niche.com) begins by talking about the high percentage of rich/ privileged students. Is that stereotype felt by students on campus in everyday life? 

Some reviews say some students are more in it for the social life, however I've also been told UVA is of high academic rigor. At UVA, are you surrounded with students eager and ambitious to learn and lead, or do you find students are more focused on the football games/ greek life/ etc.?

Finally, how hard are the classes? Does school work consume all your time?

[Guide] Connecting to Eduroam from Linux,29,3,"Tested on Arch Linux with `netctl` and `wpa_supplicant`. Should work on any system with either `NetworkManager` or `netctl`+`wpa_supplicant`. 99% of people reading this will have `NetworkManager` with some Ubuntu-based system; things are a bit easier for you. Only works for University members who can acquire a .p12 certificate (faculty, staff, students).

**Step 1:** If you haven't already, connect to Welcome_to_UVa_Wireless and [register your device's MAC address](http://netreg.virginia.edu/). You can find your wifi card's MAC on most modern systems with `iw dev`.

**Step 2:** Connect to wahoo. This is straightforward with `NetworkManager` or `wifi-menu`.

**Step 3:** Generate and download a .p12 certificate. You can get this [here](https://in.virginia.edu/limited). You will need your credentials to get this. Download it and save it to a secure location with strict permisisons (600). Note that this page **does not work** if it detects that your web browser has an unsupported (I.E. Linux) user-agent string. Use a [user-agent switcher](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=user%2Dagent%20switcher) for your browser to spoof it to Windows or something like that.

**Step 4:** Download [Eduroam's setup tool for Linux at the UVA Main Campus](https://cat.eduroam.org/). Yes, this exists, yes it is as easy to use as it sounds, no, UVA does not hand it out through their main site. [Direct Link](https://cat.eduroam.org/user/API.php?action=downloadInstaller&api_version=2&lang=en&device=linux&profile=3614).

**Step 5:** Run the tool; you must have `python` and `openssl` installed. Point it to your .p12 file. Enter the password you just used to generate the certificate. If you have `NetworkManager`, your journey ends here and you should just be able to use the generated profile. Switch to it with via command line or GUI.

**Step 6:** If you use `netctl` you have some more work to do. The tool will spit 3 files out into `~/.cat_installer/`: `user.p12`, `ca.pem`, `cat_installer.conf`. Move `ca.pem` into `/etc/netctl/`, or some other convenient location you can remember. Again, this file should have strict permissions.

**Step 7:** Create a new `netctl` profile in `/etc/netctl/`. Name it whatever you want, I chose `YOUR_DEVICE-eduroam`. Here is an example profile:

```
Description='UVA Eduroam Secure Network'
Interface=YOUR_DEVICE
Connection=wireless
ESSID='eduroam'
Security=wpa-configsection
IP='dhcp'
WPAConfigSection=(
        'ssid=""eduroam""'
        'key_mgmt=WPA-EAP'
        'pairwise=CCMP'
        'group=CCMP TKIP'
        'eap=TLS'
        'ca_cert=""/etc/wpa_supplicant/ca.pem""'
        'identity=""YOUR_ID@virginia.edu""'
        'altsubject_match=""DNS:wireless.itc.virginia.edu""'
        'phase2=""auth=""'
        'password=""YOUR_PASSWORD""'
        'anonymous_identity=""""'
)
```

Of course, replace entries in all caps with your respective names.

Note that `WPAConfigSection` is just the lines of `cat_installer.conf` verbatim where each line is wrapped in single quotes `'`. The reason I told you to download the tool instead of just copying this config is because the network configuration may change in the future, and the setup tool will always work with any configuration changes, while this post may end up out of date at some point. Also because the tool generates your .pem file for you.

Now run `sudo netctl switch-to PROFILE_NAME` or `sudo systemctl restart netctl-auto@DEVICE_NAME` depending on which one you use. You should ""just connect"" to Eduroam!

**Cleanup**: You should delete/shred the `~/.cat_installer/` directory, or secure the files within. These files can safely be deleted without affecting your ability to connect.",d2spgw,UVA
Considering UVA for semester abroad (from Europe),8,14,"Hey everyone!

I'm an engineering student in a Danish university (but I come from Italy) and we have the opportunity to apply for an overseas semester-long exchange program. I would love to do a semester in the U.S. so I looked at the list of available unis and UVA is one of them.

There are a couple of American unis I'm looking at, (mainly UVA and San Francisco State University) and I need to prioritise between them for the application, so I wanted to ask a few questions to you guys about UVA and the area. :)

* Is it a good school academically? (specifically the engineering part if someone from there reads this)
* How much on average would the rent be for a room/apartment in the area of the uni (max 45 min commute)?
* Is Charlottesville in general a nice place to live for a 21 year-old? In terms of social life, whether it's easy to make friends etc. :)
* What kind of atmosphere is there on campus?
* What kind of weather do you get in the fall/early winter? (that's when I would be doing my semester abroad)

Is it often an ""elephant in the room"" or is there open discourse about these issues? How has policy adjusted in handling these problems?

2.) I'm privileged enough to be selected for the Echols Scholar program. What is the experience like for Echols scholars? Have you found it to have changed your university experience? 

3.) If you could permanently cure the university of one mistake first-years commonly make, what would it be?

4.) I don't have a particular major in mind at the moment. When do I need to have this down if I want to set on the path to one of UVas more competitive schools?

5.) How socially necessary/beneficial is it for me to be involved with fraternities? How much of a time committment is it? Is there a stigma against frats now?

Perspective from a recent alum,26,4,"Since the RS article, the tone and sense of community in this subreddit, obviously, has changed quite a bit. Additionally, I've heard the student body on Grounds has felt very divided as well.

To the posters who are current UVA students, I can only offer this perspective as a young alum: I imagine that as a current student, every criticism of the university or the Greek system feels like a personal attack. These are the institutions through which you met your best friends or your significant other. Through these institutions you found your passion and self-confidence, you've come into your own.

As you get older, these criticism are going to sting less. It will feel less like a personal attack and more of what it is intended to be: constructive criticism of the blind-spots in academic institutions and the social structures that comprise it

My advice? You will be all the more happy for it if you can reach that level of self-awareness and introspection sooner rather than later. 

This is why I can look back fondly on the 4 years I spent in Charlottesville and still agree that UVA and UVA's Greek life isn't perfect. This is why I can read [Jia Tolentino's article](http://jezebel.com/rush-after-a-rape-on-campus-a-uva-alum-goes-back-to-ru-1682251600) for what it is, and not put up walls of defensiveness. 

*Rolling Stone Pt. II*, this article is not. It's a pretty well-written reflection on UVA from a UVA and ISC alumna. It is critical at times, but to be honest, parts of the UVA and the Greek system *are* worthy of a little criticism/mockery. The freaking TJ wankfest! The puritanical rules around girls' rush! Second-year bro power-tripping on a filthy couch in a doorway! A lot us *are* rich white students, who *are* sometimes (as anyone ages 18-22 often is) clueless about the experiences of others!

Don't take all well-meaning criticism of an institution as a personal attack. Being able to recognize and reflect on faults is a skill that will help you in your personal and professional life. This is an excellent chance to start honing it now.

Another First Year Planning for His Future... (housing and study abroad),4,3,"Hey guys! I'm a first year in the College, having a good time here at UVA. Right now though, it's somewhat of a stressful weekend what with all the planning I have to do. So I'll boil it down to two main topics:

1. Second Year Housing - I've heard not so great things about living on-campus next year (eg. long walks, no air conditioning). Would you guys recommend quickly grabbing some friends and signing a lease on off campus housing, or has your on-campus experience been good as well? This will be super helpful to the dozens of first years browsing here frequently as well haha.

2. One of the main things I've been looking forward to at UVA is the potential to study abroad. Being in Chinese and potentially majoring in Foreign Affairs, I have particular interest in visiting China and potentially another country as well. But my question is when. I know each semester carries its own pros and cons when it comes to study abroad, so I'm trying to get some anecdotes to back up my decision.

Marsh says UVA Medical Center staff lost or destroyed critical evidence needed for his client‚Äôs sexual misconduct hearing, evidence that may have kicked the accused perpetrator out of UVA for good.

""There's a sense of betrayal not only by their victimization by fellow students but there's a sense of institutional betrayal,"" he stated.

The federal complaint says University of Virginia Medical Center staff lost photographs taken by the sexual assault nurse examiner and there were inconsistencies in the descriptions of the victim‚Äôs injuries.

Marsh says not having that critical evidence left his client without justice and a rapist on grounds. Now, two and half years after the incident, he says the victim is still waiting to find out if UVA violated Title IX - a law that requires gender equity for men and women in every education program that receives federal funding.

According to the complaint, third-year UVA student ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù was raped during the early morning hours of December 2, 2011, in the suspect‚Äôs apartment.

Marsh stated, ""It was a fairly calculated and brutal attack on this woman.""

Doe's life at UVA changed that night after meeting a fellow student at a debate society meeting. In an authenticated online post originally published in UVA's student newspaper, the Cavalier Daily, Doe writes: ""He offered me a beer. The next thing I could remember was waking up in a sun-light room, naked, in pain, next to him.""

According to Marsh, a drug may have been used. ""We believe that she was drugged using a date rape drug and she was pretty viciously raped by this person.""

On December 5, she reported the rape to Nicole Eramo, the chair of the university's sexual misconduct board. That same day Doe went to the Martha Jefferson Hospital emergency room for treatment. In the following days she was tested for AIDS at the UVA Student Health Center and reported the rape to the Charlottesville Police Department.

The complaint shows that on December 8, Charlottesville police took her to the UVA Medical Center, where she underwent an exam by Kathryn Laughon, a sexual assault nurse examiner.

""It‚Äôs a fairly graphic process of making these images, with dye and special cameras and an intrusive examination."" Marsh said.

Marsh says when the time came around for the Doe's sexual misconduct hearing, the photographs taken during the exam were nowhere in sight.

""There was a long process of trying to figure out where are the images, who has them, where did they come from, were they made, where were they kept?"" Marsh stated.

Marsh says that's not the only place where things went wrong. According to the complaint, Laughon wasn‚Äôt consistent in describing the injuries. Documents state Laughon told the victim's mother there was ‚Äúa jagged tear of the hymen.‚Äù But, later she told Eramo that there were ‚Äúno injuries.‚Äù

The complaint also claims Eramo shared confidential medical records from another medical facility with Laughon. It states: ""Laughon accessed protected medical information to which she was not entitled, and shared protected medical information without consent of the victim."" The complaint further explains there is to be no sharing of information with individuals other than those to whom the victim has given written authorization.

According to the complaint, the records didn't all make it to the university-run sexual misconduct hearing, including photographs that Marsh says were crucial for his client to seek justice.

Eramo did acknowledge their importance. ""Sometimes those medical records or photographs can be very helpful,"" she stated.

UVA isn't alone; it is one of 55 schools being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints. Click here for more information and a list of the schools that are under investigation.

Eramo says since the start of UVA's academic year, 31 students have come to her office to talk about a sexual misconduct incident. Nine of them have filed a complaint with the university, formal or informal, and some of those victims aren't staying silent. UVA Victims of Rape is a website devoted to issue.

Emily Renda was raped four years ago, just six weeks into her freshman year at UVA.

""I definitely didn't feel that what happened was anybody else's fault but mine for a very long time and that really limited my motivation to report or go forward,‚Äù she stated.

Renda has devoted several years at UVA to educating others about sexual violence, even serving on a White House task force aimed at preventing sexual assaults on campus.  As for UVA being under federal investigation, she says, ""It‚Äôs a great opportunity for intense scrutiny of not only our policies, our procedures but as students, how we treated each other.""

One of those policies is UVA's student honor code. It says that if you lie, cheat, or steal, you'll be kicked out of the university. So what about sexual misconduct? When asked if anyone had ever been expelled for that, Eramo said, ‚Äúnot in my 10 years here.‚Äù

UVA staff wouldn't comment on the case, however, they did later send a statement in an email. It reads in part: ‚Äúthe university has been working with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights since summer of 2011 on its review of our policies and practices in the area of Title IX/sexual misconduct. The university has worked to provide OCR any information needed, and will continue to do so."" Click here to read the full statement.

As for the suspect, Marsh says he later became a teaching assistant at the university. While NBC29 cannot confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement, a spokesman with UVA says if a student goes through a hearing process and is found not responsible, then the case is closed.",2niugp,UVA

Average GPA for transfer?,5,5,"Hi, I'm looking to transfer to SEAS as a Systems Engineering major.  My school doesn't offer the major nor conduct any research in the area. I'll be applying for the fall of 2015. So far, I've completed three semesters of school (I'm taking the fall 2014 semester off to work fulltime due to finances). Currently, I'm attending a state flagship on the east coast (non-Virginia resident) as an statistics and econ major. My overall GPA is 3.65 with 59 credits completed so far. I'm concerned since my GPA seems to be on the lower side. I had two good semesters, my first (3.85 w/19credits) and third- 4.0 w/22credits. However, my second semester, my GPA slipped to a 3.07 (18 credits). I don't have any excuses other than underestimating my course load and having a poor work ethic. I've learned my lesson since. I also have two great recs and am involved on campus (research assistant,club president,etc.). GPA based on stats classes is ~3.9, but econ major GPA is 3.45 (1 C+, and B, remaining As/A-s). I have completedthe prerequisite courses for engineering (Calc,chem, physics,etc.).

Considering applying to UVA,3,2,"Greetings, all. I'm currently finishing up my second year at TCC and will be graduating next spring with an associates in Social Science. I've got a 4.0 GPA, and from what I discovered all of my credits (with the exception of 2 classes) will transfer over. That being said, I won't be able to transfer as part of the articulation agreement since I haven't taken any foreign languages in college (I took three years of Spanish back in high school that a majority of other universities will accept). My goal is to be an English major, with the intent of becoming a teacher.

I know that generally SAT test results are required when applying, but I've also heard that if they were taken more than a certain number of years prior to applying then they aren't necessary? I graduated high school back in 2008 and actually never even took my SAT.

Is there anything I should know about the application process, or about UVA in general? How is Charlottesville? How difficult/large are the classes in general? I've heard that UVA is very challenging (which I like). How's the social life on campus? Party scene, bars, etc? Thanks in advance for any help.",3kasea,UVA

My Coach Bennett Story,45,2,"I put this up on Facebook but I feel like others beside my small group should know.

Quick back story before the wall of text. I'm 29. I was born, raised, and currently reside in the Charlottesville metropolitan area(Albemarle county). I've been to countless UVA football and basketball games, going back to Welsh and Gillien. My mom has been a nurse at UVA for over 25 years. I have an uncle, a great uncle, a cousin,  and a grandfather who have attended UVA. However, UVA fandom did not rub off on me. This story is one of three Coach Bennett stories that I have, the other two are just seeing him in public.

My Tony Bennett Story.

As many of you know, I am by no means a UVA athletics fan and I wont be jumping on the bandwagon just because they won the Tournament. However, a couple years ago I worked for Papa John's delivering pizza and our delivery area covered the UVA campus. I got a delivery assignment for around 30 pizzas to the Batten School on McCormick road. I parked behind the car that I essentially followed the whole way there. As I was pulling the bags from my car, I looked up to see Coach Bennett exiting the car. I was following him as he was going the same direction as me. It became clear we were headed to the same destination and he held the door as I carried the pizzas in. I met up with my person of contact for the order and followed them into a large room where I became aware that Bennett would be speaking. A short side note is that each pizza bag holds 5 pizzas. To ensure the quality of the pizza, a driver shouldnt carry more than 2 bags as they can be awkward to hold, causing pizzas to slide around and get damaged. So this delivery was going to require multiple trips to the car due to the amount of pizzas and that they had also ordered several 2 liters. For each trip to and from, the door was held open not by the person of contact, not by the students who were arriving for Bennett's lecture, (ironically the Batten school is for leadership) but by Coach Bennett himself. What impressed me most was the entire time the people facilitating the lecture, including my person of contact, were so focused on kissing his ass and doing everything they could for him, that they didnt see the irony in him helping somebody so far beneath him in the pecking order of the event. Will I become a UVA fan? Probably not. Do I respect Tony Bennett for the simple decency of helping the lowly pizza delivery guy? Absolutely. So congratulations to Coach Bennett on the Championship and I hope Miami beats you next year. :)",bcy4rz,UVA
After Graduate Opportunities for UVA Engineers (current HS Senior),9,12,"Hi, current High School Senior here:

&#x200B;

I currently deciding on accepting admission between UVA and Virginia Tech engineering. I am leaning toward UVA engineering for the theoretical and critical thinking approach to teaching, engineering-business minor, and campus live.

My one biggest concern is the opportunities after graduating from UVA engineering appear to be less distinguished than that of Virginia Tech graduates. Could any UVA engineering seniors/graduates speak to this?

Which one is better: UVA or UC Berkeley?,1,11,"Hey guys, I'm an international student who applied to 14 US colleges, and got rejected and waitlisted by a ton.

Rejected: UPenn (ED), UChicago (ED2), Brown, Dartmouth, USC, NYU, Emory

Waitlisted: Boston College, Purdue, UCLA, UC Berkeley

Accepted: UC Davis, UC San Diego, UVA

Berkeley waitlists very few people, and since their yield is quite low, they end up accepting about half of their waitlisted students (last year was 54%). Assuming I get off the waitlist, I was wondering which university would be better between UVA and Berkeley for an international student.

I applied for economics at UVA (want to go to McIntire later) and at UC Berkeley. I'm thinking of eventually working in finance, and while I know UVA is a feeder for Wall Street firms, I find it hard to forgo Berkeley's arguably better international reputation so easily.

UVA Pros:

1. Literally called a Public Ivy for a reason

2. Really good economics program, and McIntire is also a great business school and isn't as competitive to get into

3. Charlottesville seems like a nice university town, so I won't be stressed all the time as I am in high school (IB diploma student). Definitely nowhere as stressful as Berkeley, where I have to compete with crazy-competitive Asians from the Bay Area and competitive countries like Singapore, China, India, etc (I'm Indian myself but I have spent my entire life in other countries) to get into the business school and to get good internships.

4. Good social scene (but I'm borderline nerdy, so while I do have many friends, not many of them are the kind of people who get drunk every weekend and are super social)

5. Campus is so beautiful

UC Berkeley Pros:

1. Arguably better international reputation than UVA (not really a dealbreaker as I plan to stay in the US after graduation anyways)

2. Greater international student population (easier for me to integrate into the community)

3. Another Public Ivy, and arguably better at economics than UVA

4. Campus is so beautiful like UVA, but there are also more things to do in Berkeley than in Charlottesville.

5. Not as much focus on Greek life (I'm not really sure how dominant Greek life is at UVA, but I hear it's pretty popular and that to get into McIntire or Wall Street, being in a fraternity is almost mandatory)

I can't think of any other pros for either university, and I'd like your input on this. I would also appreciate any insight from international students at UVA regarding your experiences.

Thanks!",b774f5,UVA
Best place to hold a PhD defense?,3,4,"I'm looking for a room to hold my PhD defense in the next few months and while I would love to have it in the Rotunda, it's totally booked for the dates I have available. Since I'm a grad student and therefore don't know the whole campus as well as many people on this sub I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for an alternate location. Ideally the room will hold 40-50 people comfortably without seeming empty (no 200 person lecture halls), and will have a nice UVA/historical feel if possible. It has to have equipment to have a powerpoint projected as well as audio via a microphone.

Thanks!

Premed in UVA or GMU?,2,11,"Hi everyone! I'm a sophomore at LBSS and I plan on staying in state, and following a premed path. I've already gone to GMU for a campus tour and will soon go on one at UVA. I'm in need of advice from someone other than my parents, who really want me to go to GMU because it is closer to home. UVA is only 3 hours away from our house, so I really don't see the issue. Anyways, what would you say are the advantages of UVA over GMU, to convince my parents? The price of UVA is obviously more, which is a con. The admission rate is also really really low, what does UVA like to see? I can answer questions about myself if that can help. I'd really like to get into a well known medical university (Johns Hopkins would be amazing!) but will going to UVA give me a better or worse chance of getting in when compared to GMU? Also, anyone in the premed program, any tips for what to do in high school to prepare? And any general tips/advice from y'all? Thank you so much!! - rani",amtj7x,UVA
First time attending a UVA game,13,25,"First off, if this sub is more for academics, I understand. I‚Äôm also going to post in r/Wahoowa in case that‚Äôs a better sub for this kind of stuff.

My girlfriend is a student at Liberty, and I‚Äôll be visiting her next weekend. We will be traveling to Charlottesville for the Liberty/UVA game on November 10. Neither of us have been to a UVA game before, but she‚Äôs fairly familiar with Virginia‚Äôs campus.

Basically, I‚Äôd like to know if there‚Äôs anything I need to be aware of with a typical UVA game. So here is a list of questions:

Will we be required to get to campus a certain way? 
What is parking going to be like? Will we need a parking pass?
Is there a food place we have to check out? 
Are there cool traditions we should know about? I‚Äôm particularly interested to see if there‚Äôs neat marching band stuff - I marched in college. 
Is there anything else that we should know ahead of time?

I just graduated from Penn State, where there‚Äôs so much going on in a typical game day. These are things you have to know if you want a successful PSU game experience. So I figured I should check on these with UVA.

Thanks, and congrats on your ranking in all the major polls! Following UVA from afar has been fun this season, and I‚Äôm really hoping to see you in the ACCCG.",9t9n6x,UVA

Deciding between VT and UVA,12,26,"So some background: I'm a current high school senior accepted into UVA's College of Arts and Sciences and Virginia Tech's School of Neuroscience (and Honors College)
I'm facing a serious dilemma: I have no clue which one I should go to.

I know I want to study Neuroscience. I work an internship in the Sontheimer Lab at the VTCRI (for 2 years now) and I absolutely love it. My sister is currently a third year at UVA studying biology. I live in Roanoke, so Blacksburg is about 45 minutes away while Charlottesville is a strong 2 hours. I've played in my school's marching band and absolutely want to continue playing in college, as well as possibly joining a school's jazz ensemble. 

My family is originally from Michigan and, for the most part, are avidly against VT. They hate the colors, they hate the fans, they really dislike the school in general. My mom is pretty actively trying to convince me to go to UVA; she quotes statistics about acceptance rate, UVA's ranking, the sports programs there, the nature of the marching band, and especially claims UVA would be a much better place to earn a degree from. I've gone through high school with UVA as my ideal school. When I think of a college campus, football game, class, or marching band, I think of UVA, as going there to see my sister so often has embedded that thought into my mind. I absolutely don't hate VT, in fact I'm entirely open to going there (of course there's still thoughts in my mind about VT being somewhat inferior but that's besides the point). I'm not entirely sure about the nature of the VT Honors College though; I don't know if they'll offer me scholarships. I've only been to VT's campus a few times. I don't know much about them, but I know there's a wonderful opportunity for me there. Ideally, I want a school that'll set me up to either go to a good medical school or earn a PhD. I want a school with good student life, and one that I'll get something out of academically, where my degree will get me far in professionally. 
Here's what I need to know (and I understand you'll be biased towards your own school):
1. What do you not like about UVA?
2. Looking past your own bias towards the other school, what do you actually admire about VT?
3. Why did you pick UVA as your school?
4. Looking past the statistics and facts, do you think getting a degree from UVA will actually make you more qualified and prepared than someone from Tech?
5. What are the connections you've made with professionals and the outside world (like people who might hire you) like?
6. If you were in my position, which one would you choose?

I'll answer any follow-up questions you might have, like what I value or what I've done in school. I'm not looking explicitly for a persuasive response for UVA or VT, but I'll still take it into account.
(For those who tell me to visit both, I'll be attending DOTL on 4/2 and the VT event on 4/7 with a visit with the Honors College)

Thank you to everyone who responds, and I'll probably be posting this on other subs.",87ih5p,UVA

I recently explored the fine arts building while on break from studying for hours in the library and it made me remember how much I really appreciated art and art history and how I was always looking to make time to practice my drawing skills. I saw they had flyers for live figure drawing labs but those are reserved mainly for fine arts students. However, I did see the guest art lectures the fine arts department will be hosting at the Harn Museum so I'll be attending those. So now I'm just wondering, what libraries on campus host good drawing books and resources? Are there any leisure courses for art (besides painting) or live drawing sessions I can walk in and participate on that I don't know of? I already looked through the catalog at Library West and it is hard to find good drawing instruction books (I did find a few on Japanese manga drawing and artist biographies) but not much more than that that pertains to my interests in learning. Thank you.",d04djt,UFL

"This is an obvious recommendation...for the love of God, intern or work on campus (those desk jobs are great)",16,5,"I went to CAS and got less than zero guidance from my department to intern. I paid for it dearly. Not a single adult I engaged planning out graduation said, ""Have you interned yet?""

You're lucky to be going to a college where publishing groups here, start-ups, and consulting firms have college recruiting programs. From there you can network. 

Ask your adjuncts and professors for help and make use of career services. 

I realize for those of you dependent on funding this might be difficult but if it means taking longer to graduate, it's worth it. 

And if you can take an academic advising workshop on something like Excel or programming, I would do so. That wasn't offered to me; currently it's only offered at Stern.

I focused more on classes because I was struggling; it was stupid. 

If you can get a job in the president's office for something like tuition remission or work as an admin aid or a student administrative aid job through career services (go ask about it), then do it. You can study and do homework at those and it counts as administrative experience. Even better if you, say, get a job related to something more complex, like planning events for an institute of one of the colleges and working with a budget, creating reports, etc.",6q0ylc,nyu

Political atmosphere on campus,0,4,"I have been attending NYU for a few semesters at this point, and I have found that the atmosphere here has become unbearable.

Ironically, I feel like a Jewish person must have felt in Germany in the 1940s.

Specifically, I am a trump voter. I don't have the most conventional viewpoints regarding politics, and some of my discussions regarding creating a white ethnostate may have turned a few classmates off. However, I always thought NYU would be an open and welcoming place for discussion and sharing opinions.

Today my bike was stolen on campus for the second time. How can I get NYU involved to protect students who fall victim to these thefts?,1,9,"I arrived outside of the Courant building for my 8am about 10 minutes late and decided to lock my bike up the bus pole right outside of the building (As many do daily). I put my uLock through my back tire rim and locked it on the other side of the pole. I came outside from class at 9:15 to see that my bike was missing and only my uLock remained unbroken on the ground around the pole. This basically means that someone **took the time** to dismantle my wheel around the lock. 

Living in Soho housing, biking is a very integral part of my day and commute. I sincerely wish that there was some sort of safety net for students who have something like this happen to them. I am also aware that there is an NYU bike storage area behind the Tisch building. However it is not always easy for students to go back and forth through the congested area several times a day. I fully understand that there is risk parking your bike outside in NYC, but **students should feel confident that they can secure their belongings outside of the very buildings in which they study**. Three weeks ago my SO had her bike stolen right outside of the NYU Health Center despite being locked to the scaffolding. Of course, someone came by and dismantled the scaffolding itself and walked away with the bike. This happened in plain view and **directly in front of the building**, in such a way that it was surely captured on camera, as in my case. 

I just think that it is very sad that NYU will essentially tell their students, ""that sucks"" and do absolutely nothing about it. They will ""investigate"" the theft, but only as a means of ""improving their own security."" -NYUPS Officer. This is now the **second** time that my bike has been stolen in front of an NYU owned building and also the second time that I will have to figure out alone how to replace it. I think that NYU should offer students aid in these situations. With the resources at NYU I think that we should help students replace their stolen items, especially if there is stone-cold proof of larceny. Or in the very least, we should employ better tactics of campus security. (Ex. extra cameras outside, **MORE ACCESSIBLE BIKE RACKS**)

Thoughts regarding free speech and censorship on campus.,14,36,"Sorry that I'm late to the party on this one, but it slipped my mind until now.

I'm an NYU alum and have been following, to some extent, the recent Chick-Fil-A fiasco.  As most of you know, NYU houses the only Chick-Fil-A in the state of New York.  

When I was a student there, and continuing to this day, there was constant pressure from LGBT groups to ban Chick-Fil-A on campus due to their anti-homosexual stance. 

While I certainly don't agree with CEO Dan Cathy's opinions about homosexuality, I do believe that he has a right to those opinions. The opinions are held in earnest and they were likely a product of his upbringing and subsequent lifestyle choices.  They may not be what liberal 18-22 year old college students want to hear, they may be offensive, misguided, and even immoral, but this is his legitimate worldview. 

With that said, it bothers me that people are trying to ban the company on campus because they disagree with the opinions of the organization's CEO.  Chick-Fil-A exists at NYU because it turns a profit.  If the university was losing money because of Chick-Fil-A, or if Chick-Fil-A was losing money by having a location at NYU, it wouldn't exist, its as simple as that. This means that despite homophobic comments, NYU students still choose to eat at Chick-Fil-A.  Most students probably don't support the ban of Chick-Fil-A.  If they did, they wouldn't eat there and Chick-Fil-A would no longer have business and would be forced to close up shop.

In that light, it seems to me that efforts by LGBT organizations to ban Chick-Fil-A from campus are the opinions of a minority being forced on the majority without consent.  If students continue to eat there, the demand exists.  If this were a democratic process (and it can be, through the free market and voting with your dollar) then Chick-Fil-A would no longer exist once the majority of students decided that it shouldn't.  **As it stands, this is an effort by a small organization to circumvent the general opinion of the student body and ban an organization because you don't like what the CEO has to say.  This blatantly flies in the face of free speech and general democratic process.** Reddit in general scoffs at efforts by conservative groups to ban and companies after PRO-LGBT remarks, why is the reverse acceptable?

A boycott is great - if it works Chick-Fil-A will be forced to cease operating at NYU.  Educating people about Chick-Fil-A's homophobic stance is also great, if it strengthens the boycott, all the better.  But what it **not** okay is ignoring the rest of the student body and NYU community and trying to disallow speech that you do not agree with.  Free speech is free speech for all, even when the opinion is unpopular. Trying to ban free speech you disagree with is a tactic of repression.  We should be focusing on educating the population on the issues that are important to us - not sweeping the opinion of the other side under the rug.

I'd like to hear opinions on this.  I'd appreciate it if the discussion doesn't center around me being a homophobe, which I'm not, or around grammatical errors, which I'm sure I made.  I'm legitimately interested in what people think about this.

My concern is that I won't be doing free weights with the right form as a beginner, which might lead to injury and lack of effectiveness.

2. Is there any of the following at either/both of Palladium/Coles: smith machine, tricep extension rope/cables, power cage, curl bars, chest press machine, butterfly, cable cross over machine?

3. Is there some kind of personal trainer for hire or lessons offered at the gyms that I could take if I'm having trouble as to how to use some of the equipment? Any assistance at all?

4. For those of you that workout and are on a meal plan, if I'm trying to gain weight and mass, what should my diet look like, especially logistically what dining halls meals are best for bulking? And also cheap places with large portions around campus?

5. And lastly, what are the peak hours in the weight room at Palladium and Coles (in the past?) Are there certain times when athletes/teams train that I should avoid? What are some of the NYU weight room etiquette and unspoken rules that I should beware of?

Any CAS CS majors frustrated with Wasserman's job-hunting resources?,34,11,"Given the school's reputation, the (high) quality of our classes, our location to the industry, and how much this shit costs... I'm really surprised and disappointed at how little Wasserman Manhattan does for CS students. Some points I noticed while focusing on getting myself hired in a new-grad position:

* On Campus Recruitment (OCR) has a negligible selection of tech firms. I signed on right at the start of recruitment season and the only big-name tech company I saw was Microsoft. MasterCard is also there but that's about it. The rest of the listings are all consulting firms or law offices. So now we need to deal with exploding offers, vague interviewing timelines, and all the other BS that goes on with recruiting when your school doesn't stand in your corner. 

* The career fair was just as bad. I could count the big name tech companies on one hand, and some of those felt like an afterthought. The Tandon career fair I've heard is much better, which is understandable. If they're not going to let us into that one, which is again understandable, at least don't schedule it for the *same exact date* so tech recruiters have a chance to visit both. 

* Handshake does nothing that public job boards don't already do. Its only purpose is to give desperate teaching nonprofits a platform to beg undergraduate students to consider them.

* The events are also lacklustre. Pretty much the same firms as OCR and the career fair, and not much is focused on tech. 

* I haven't met anybody at Wasserman Manhattan who actually knows something about the tech recruiting scene. Sure, it's nice to get my resume reviewed, but when they don't know what anything on there means it only goes so far. 

How do you all deal with this? I have very few friends or family graduated and working in tech that I can ask for advice/referrals from when it feels like all my peers have a massive network. I have no recruiters I'm communicating with because the career fair was a wash. I just feel blind and hopeless because the ""amazing job center"" we have here is utterly failing me during the critical recruitment season.",d8evls,nyu

Commuting from Long Island?,11,18,"First year applicant here. I guess it‚Äôs kinda Risky‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to reveal where I‚Äôm from but Long Island is big and I‚Äôm sure NYU gets a ton of apps from here. The commute takes about an hour and 45 mins via public transportation on a typical day. I feel like that might be too much. I did a program at NYU and the commute was pretty exhausting and I was spending nearly 4 hours of my day just sitting on trains. A lot of Long Islanders do the same commute but they‚Äôre mostly people who go to the city for their 9 to 5 jobs so it‚Äôs not like they have to study and what not. I feel like college is too rigorous for me to spend all that time on trains. It‚Äôll cost me so much time to study, and also to sleep!! And I‚Äôve already heard people complain about commuting to NYU from Queens, which has to be at most half of the time of my commute (I‚Äôve gone to NYC from Queens multiple times so I know). At the same time, tuition is already so expensive, I don‚Äôt see myself getting good financial aid, so idk if an additional like $20k is worth it when the commute is at least doable.

TLDR: if my commute to NYC campus from where I live is almost 2 hours (4 hours a day going and coming) will dorming be worth the additional cost?

Also, you don‚Äôt have to live nearby NYU or know what it‚Äôs like commuting to answer. That would give the best insight, but just knowing how much time you spend on campus studying, what scheduling classes is like, etc, is good enough for good insight.",clmaxy,nyu

NYU Welcome Week/Freshman Questions,6,8,"1. Do I have to stay on campus for welcome week or can I just commute from home?
2. Is there an actual place I can ask this other than the NYU Reddit?
3. How mandatory is the NYUReads book/assignment?
4. How necessary is the community service activity during Welcome Week? Is there a penalty of some sort for missing this or any other ""mandatory"" activity?
5. What's the deal with the cohort?

I'm in CAS and am a commuter, so I‚Äôm not looking to have a bunch of back and forth trips.",ceixrf,nyu
