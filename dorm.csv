Apartment or dorm again as a sophomore,5,9,"Okay so I am currently a freshman living in Newman this year. So far I like living in Newman because I have met some nice people and some good friends, but I don’t really want to stay there again for a sophomore year. I am not catholic and while the dorm doesn’t force religion down my throat or anything, there is a vibe that I don’t particularly love. I wouldn’t really want to live there again as a sophomore.

Three of my friends have reached out to me regarding apartments, and I believe i would enjoy living in an apartment next year. However, my parents are not a fan of the idea and would prefer for me to live in Newman again.  So I am not sure what to do because I am not loving the idea of living in the dorms again. 

Is moving into an apartment too early as a sophomore? Do the majority of people live in dorms again? Should I stay in Newman because of the perks (good food + location)?",db13kj,UIUC
Dorm changing,29,24,"I literally just moved in to uiuc on the 22nd and I was already low key annoyed by my roommate as we both have very different perspectives on living as he is an international student.

It even sounds like he has trouble breathing as there are a lot of gurgling noises and weird exhales. I have literally not had a good nights sleep in 4 days. This really sucks because I literally just got settled down.

I also already confronted him about it in a nice way and we talked for like an hour and him being unconscious, there is really nothing he can do about it. I have tried dealing with it multiple diff ways and I really am concerned that waking up in the middle of the night and then not being able to fall back asleep is going to affect my performance in school because it has already stressed me out even before classes have started...

At this point I’m over her & can’t change rooms unless I find someone that already wants to switch because housing is at capacity right now.

Therapy Dog for finals stress,49,13,"Hi everyone; just a quick question! 

I have a therapy dog (passed his test in August) and I was thinking of bringing him around campus to see if anyone would want to interact with him before finals as he could possibly help people feel a little less stressed. My original idea was to bring him around the quad on Reading Day but I realized there may not be a ton of people out given that most will be studying in their dorms/apartments. 

Question is this: Would it be better for me to bring him out on Reading Day, or maybe next week when finals are actually happening? Either way we're happy to be outside for a bit, thankfully my finals were all just papers so I'm done with those. I could bring him out both days, of course, I just wanted to know if general interest was preferred for Reading Day or next week? 

*I won't be bringing him into buildings as I haven't asked permission to do that, so we'll be outside.*

**tl;dr: My dog likes people so much he got a certificate for it; would Reading Day or Finals Week be better for people?**

How to meet people here (serious question),17,16,"I know this gets asked here a lot, but all the answers either say RSOs with no further explanation or are jokes, so I'm hoping to get actually helpful responses (RSOs are a real option, but it's a bit late to join one and I don't really think it would help my problem).

My problem is that this school is just so big. I went to a slightly above-average sized high-school but of course it was puny compared to this place. Making friends there was so effortless because I saw the same people five days a week. After high-school, all my really good friends went to other schools and I've lost contact with them, and I don't really want to contact any of the people that I do know who actually attend here, nor would I be able to. So I was really hoping to make at least some new friends this semester, but so far I've had no luck. I'm pretty worried about that, since I'd imagine its much easier to make friends as a freshman then as a sophomore, especially because there is no chance in hell that I would live in a dorm room again.

Although I'm not in an RSO, I spend a lot of time outside of my dorm (I really hate that place). I eat in the cafeteria, go to church, study in public spaces, etc. Also, it's not like I have extreme social anxiety or anything. I get along fine with my roommate and lab partners, but there is sort of an implied business-relationship there. I actually did meet some friendly people at certain times, in the cafeteria or in large lecture halls, but after its over I never see them again (and this is a rare occurrence anyway, and I'm mad at myself for blowing these chances). Usually, my shyness is high enough that I never want to initiate small talk with random people (and I wouldn't know what to say anyway), so this only happens when someone else comes up to me. The fact that I don't know anyone here also makes it difficult for me to go to events since I don't want to go alone. I've gone to the movies a few times alone, but that's not really a place to make friends. I was planning on joining an RSO at the start of the semester, but I couldn't decide on one and I think it wouldn't help me much anyway (eg everyone else already has their friend group, and I wouldn't see people often enough to become friends with them). Now it's too late to join any, but if you have suggestions for low time-commitment ones where I could easily make friends, I'll consider joining next year or semester.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I'm looking for any suggestions of how to meet people and make friends, since I'm sure I'm not the only person here who is having this issue, and probably some people figured out what to do.",diivul,UIUC
Get a humidifier,98,9,"It’s cold as shit outside now and that means it’s dry as shit inside. It’s going to get annoying and inconvenient real quick that your hands and your lips are always cracking and you get shocked every time you touch a doorknob and you wake up with a sore/dry throat every morning and your skin is super dry all the time. I just feel the need to spread awareness about humidifiers. Running them, especially at night, during the winter makes my quality of life so much better. It’s especially helpful in the dorms where you have absolutely no control over how much the heater is on.  This is just an awareness post that you don’t just have to suffer. Also if you do get one you really need to make sure to use filtered/distilled (putting it through the Britta filter has always worked for me) water to avoid covering everything nearby in calcium dust and you also need to clean it every so often with bleach or hydrogen peroxide so you’re not spewing mold and bacteria around.

I'm about to graduate -- my thoughts on how to make the most out of your 4+ years here (An exposition from a sober ECE man),283,36,"Original inspiration for this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/bpeoew/ive_graduated_time_to_spill_the_beans_a_ranty/

It's a great thread, and I doubt this will be even half as popular. Still, I felt compelled to write something like this. As they say, learning from your own mistakes is good, but learning from someone else's mistakes is even better.

0) Lift weights and work out regularly. This is point zero for a reason. I started lifting regularly a little over a year ago, and in that time, my body has changed in very noticeable ways. But I started for the psychological benefits, and continue to do it for the psychological benefits. The motivation has to come from within. It can't be external.

1) Eat healthy. This is also extremely important. On a college campus, temptations abound everywhere. But you can't live off a diet of free pizza and perform your best. You are what you eat, literally. 

2) Go to class. This one is a no-brainer. Go to class even if the lectures are recorded. Force yourself to pay attention in class, even if what you are learning is boring or nonsense. Chances are you won't learn half as much if you only watch the recordings.

3) Do some drugs, but not too many. Understand what you're getting yourself into. There's a lot of information on the internet. I can vouch for weed and psychedelics. Booze is mediocre at best. I wouldn't touch cocaine or anything harder with a 20 foot pole. 

4) Visualize the person you want to become and actively work toward it. This requires a bit of introspection. 0, 1, and 3 may help you here. A good thought exercise is to work backwards from this ideal version of yourself to where you are currently.

5) Compare yourself to the person you were yesterday, not to what another person is today. You may feel a tinge of jealousy when you overhear someone deciding between internships at Facebook, Google, or Goldman Sachs. Ignore it. You don't know anything about this person's life except for that small fact. They could be struggling massively in another area of life. People love to share what makes them look good, and hide what makes them look weak or incompetent.

6) Keep your home clean. For the love of god, don't live in your own filth. It is not attractive. A gunk-free home means a gunk-free mind.

7) Cut yourself some slack. Life is life. Shit happens. Everyone has bad days. One bad day does not equal a bad semester. I felt pretty crappy after getting a 0% on a CS 225 programming exam once. But I still ended up with an A in the class.

8) Live in a social dorm where you can meet like minded people. I opted for a dorm that was historically known as a quiet, engineering-focused dorm. In retrospect, it was the worst decision of my college career. I stumbled socially my freshman and sophomore years, and even went through a depressive period. I managed to turn it around and am pretty happy with my life now. No regrets, but I can't help of occasionally thinking of the ""what ifs.""

9) Perhaps the most important point. Stay true to yourself and your values. Don't be someone you aren't. Constantly strive toward being a better version of yourself, not a different person entirely.",coyxtm,UIUC

Can we do anything about the new dorm contract cancellation policy?,116,10,"The old cancellation policy (before 2017):

> If I want to terminate this Contract for any reason other than those specifically described in sections 11a through 11i below, I must submit my request ... **on or before: April 15, 2016** ... for the Academic year contract

The new cancellation policy (after 2017):

> If I want to terminate this Contract for any reason other than those specifically described in sections 11a through 11i below, I must submit my request ... **within 30 days of signing** the contract during the Housing Sign-Up process (October 4, 2016-April 15, 2017)

Continuing students are encouraged to sign for a dorm as early as possible, even if they are considering moving to a non-university apartment the following year. This was good advice for plenty of reasons (e.g. popular dorms fill up quickly, friendships and living arrangements can fall through, etc.); students could just cancel their contracts if they decide on an apartment.

However, under the new policy, cancelling outside of the 30 day window will result in an **$8000+** charge. The only ways to avoid this charge are to get married or leave the university. This is absurdly unethical on so many levels:

1. This change in policy was (and still is) unannounced. I have multiple friends who were told to sign for a 17-18 dorm _last October_ who were unable to sign for an apartment once they figured out their living arrangements for _a year later_. 

2. To reiterate, these are kids _straight out of freshman year_ who are being told to sign for a dorm ""just in case"" without being warned of the new policy. Moreover, how are they supposed to know their future living arrangements _a year in advance_? 

3. The charge itself is exorbitant and unnecessary. There is no reasonable explanation as to how cancelling a dorm lease 8 months before the start would cost the university $8000. It's clear that this change was made just to trap students.

4. Students who want to stay in the dorms sophomore year and don't get trapped by the contract are _still_ unaware of the new release policy. Chances are, they will want to move to an apartment the following year, but they are at high risk of getting locked into their ""just in case"" dorm contracts junior year.

This is grossly unethical. Is there anything we can actually do to get it changed?",9dc9dw,UIUC

Got written up for bringing drunk roommate back to dorm,79,9,"This happened a couple weeks ago. It was the weekend and one night, when I was chilling in my room, I got a call from one of my friends that my roommate was blacked out at a frat party and needed to be brought home. Rushed over to the party, tried to get him as sober as possible, and then I brought him back to our dorm. The security monitor was at the desk and when we checked in, she let us know that she had to notify the RA that one of us was intoxicated. We went up to our room, and the RA was there waiting for us. This RA in particular has had a past of giving students a hard time and excessively writing up people for minor violations. The RA asked for our IDs, asked my roommate if he was fine, and then left. I didn't think much of it until today, where I received a conduct violation letter, for which I was written up for alcohol consumption, violating policies while under the influence of alcohol, failure to comply with an RA, and for being a threat to health and safety to others in the dorm. Keep in mind that I was sober the whole night and exhibited no behavior that would persuade the RA to believe that I was intoxicated. Who can I contact to not only clear up this allegation, but to also have the RA face some sort of consequence? This is a clear misuse of power and a pretty serious situation.",e25i9u,berkeley

Personally for me, I think my peak is (and always will be) second semester of freshman year.  Granted, I'm only a sophomore, but I think nothing will compare to my second semester because not only did I establish an amazing friend circle and was already acclimated to to the onslaught of academic rigor from the preceding semester, but the dorm environment allowed me to have access to an infinite number of on the fly social interactions and impromptu hangouts/adventures -- many of which will live on to be some of my most memorable times here.  

Even though I still have an amazing social circle its much harder to initiate social events and ""get in the groove"" of going on adventures since everyone lives all over the place.  

Moving out of the dorms really made me realize what a privilege I had last year and the large gaping void that's now in my life. As a result, I'm making joining extracurriculars/clubs my number one priority next semester.  

So far, this current semester is my worst semester here. Academically I've fallen into a huge slump (can't get motivated for shit) and its way less social.  I'm dying to press that reset button in ~3 weeks.

I was told that a person will have to verify my dorm situation and see if I am eligible to get my port activated. So a person came in and inspected everything and said that my port will be activated. A week past nothing happens and a few weeks later I called again and made a ticket on SAIT helpdesk. I had to wait a week for an appointment for someone to simply walk in the dorm and verify that I am eligible(this took 3-4 minutes). So again I am eligible, but apparently I need to make an appointment with the engineering team to come in and activate the port in person. It's been 2-3 weeks now, there's no response at all to my ticket. There's no ""engineering"" team that reached out to me and no more response from the SAIT helpdesk.

However, I'm used to partying literally every weekend (if i dont go to a party, i get lit by myself) but it seems like there's a huge drought of parties here if you're not in a frat.

So, what's the best way to get bids and/or get lit without being in a frat? I'm def rushing next semester",dgjja1,berkeley

Why are quiet hours less strict than courtesy hours?,7,2,"The dorms are in ""24 hour quiet hours"" now for finals, so I decided to look at the code of conduct to see just what that entails. It says that during quiet hours unreasonable noise is prohibited in and around all residential facilities. It defines unreasonable noise as ""any noise that disrupts or potentially disrupts the lives of residents or neighboring community members"".

Meanwhile, courtesy hours (which are always in place) are broken by ""any noise that disrupts or potentially disrupts the sleep or studying of other students"". 


So what's the point in even having quiet hours when you're already supposed to be quieter than they allow?",e8gzji,berkeley
$300/month to sleep on your dorm room/apartment floor,26,17,"(I changed the price to $450/month but I'm not sure how to edit the title so...) 

I anticipate a lot of contemptuous comments, but I figured this would be worth a try. I'll pay you 300 bucks a month to park my sleeping bag on your floor. If you think we could get away with it, I feel like this would be a win-win for fellow financially challenged, college debt-saddled young adults. I mostly keep to myself and I'm remarkably easy to live with; besides, I'll usually be out of the house at my job or working with professors at Berkeley. I realize that you would need to know a lot more about me, so please PM me if interested, and I'd be more than happy to provide you with more info. Thanks for reading!",9ivx6c,berkeley
Having trouble making friends.,78,34,"Hey guys. I’ve talked a good amount with people in my GBO group but haven’t really clicked with anyone. And whoever I do end up talking a lot with in GBO, just dips the next day without telling me anything. It feels like people already have groups of friends, but nobody’s invited me out for food once. It doesn’t help that I’m in the mini suites and my floor is quiet. I’m worried for what happens after GBO events end, since I’ve been going to a lot of them. With the activities then at least I have plans and people to hang out with. I’ve actively been trying to talk to people and they seem receptive and nice, but not enough to like, actually invite me to hang out with them. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. My roommates are really nice, but they knew each other from before so I feel a little excluded. I feel hella awkward whenever I tag along with them and their friends. 

I know there’s already been posts about this, but it’s so difficult for me to make friends in my dorm floor because it’s mini suites and like, nobody ever has their door open and they rarely hang in the lounge. So how should I go about making friends? Sorry to be so depressing! I had super solid friends in high school, it’s not like I’m antisocial or anything lol. Just stuck in a rut it seems.

Edit: I’m feeling a lot better now! Wrote this earlier in the evening when my roommates were out and I had nothing to do. After my GBO late night event people on my floor were actually chilling in the lounge so I hung out with them. They were pretty cool! And ofc, all of you guys reaching out was much appreciated. I just hope this continues :)",cviqum,berkeley

Best/Cheapest housing option to be able to cook for myself?,16,14,"I’m a freshman rn, thinkin about sophmore year and beyond. I feel like it’s stupid that I’m paying for the meal plan because the food honestly sucks here. 

My friends and I were thinking about a co-op, but then I read about the workshift hours and the fact that the house cooks for eachother (and it’s mostly vegan?). That sounds fine and all, but I’d rather have a cheap option that allows my friends and I to cook for just us. 

I heard that the Wada Apartments at unit 2 were a good option, as it’s a room of 4 or something and it gives u a kitchen too. 
I can’t really figure out what the pricing difference is, but how much would I be paying for the year in a co-op vs the apartment? 

I also heard that the co-ops like to party, drink, smoke, and are messy at times. I’d prefer to have something quiet and more secluded. As for cooking, I know how to cook and whatever, so do my friends, so I feel like it’d be better for us to just be on our own.

Moving to Berkeley as an international student,14,17,"Excited to be moving to Berkeley as a freshman, but just have a couple questions since I'm international and need to set up stuff like bank and mobile.

2. SIM card: I'm planning on using T-Mobile Magenta, adding a line for my roommate. Is T-Mobile service good in the area, or should I consider AT&T instead? My phone doesnt support Verizon or Sprint to my knowledge.

3. What can I reasonably expect to accomplish in a day and a half, given that my move in time is afternoon of Aug 19, which gives me a day and a half before orientation starts to get these bank and mobile stuff done? Is there anything important I'm forgetting?",cqndki,berkeley
Can anyone in/associated with IT spill the tea on if Berkeley does rogue AP detection?,18,10,"/nerd shit

My dorm straight up doesn’t get WiFi and I’m getting really irritated. I don’t have that much mobile data and my laptop is maxing out at 1-2Mb/s when it can actually connect. It’s the same for all my roommates so it’s not just me. When I head out to the hallway though I instantly hit 50-75Mb/s.

Seeing as I have no intention of spending the entire year out in the hallway, I was planning on breaking school IT policy ASAP and setting up a very low power WiFi network off the wired connection in our dorm so I can actually use my phone. I’m concerned though about being detected since I know that many enterprise wireless solutions have the ability to detect and locate rogue networks very quickly and accurately. Can any of y’all who have done something similar/are near IT/in STS  share details? Is the “no random wireless networks” just a policy so they can kill your network if it’s a problem or does IT actually seek and destroy rogue networks?

Worst UT roommate and/or dorm stories?,86,54,"I’m mostly just curious and want to hear bad stories from, specifically, the 40 acres. 

Last year, I lived in Kins, and the girls in my hall were notoriously terrible. Loud every night, crabby, little respect for their neighbors, mostly STEM (it was for the WINS freshmen, so I was one of maybe two or three non-stem majors), always going out to party (every night. especially weeknights) and coming back drunk, and always sneaking guests in late. 

My worst memories are from the bathroom. Yes, a shared bathroom for an entire wing of Kinsolving. I hoped, pleaded, prayed, that it would be an okay experience. 

It was not. My neighbors constantly left toilets unflushed, clogged, with blood or feminine hygiene products still in or on them, or left hair on the shower wall, and left their panties on the floor more times than I could count. It gets worse. Finals week of the spring semester, I am awaken one morning to the sound of yelling cleaning staff. 

Turns out, one of the girls diarrhea-d on the floor. She left it there. She didn’t even get it in a toilet. Just on the floor. 
My RA was so sweet. She told us about how we’d been known as the worst floor all year, and how that kinda sucked. 

Kins was a pretty great dorm, but the people in my wing were not. At least I came away with some good stories. I think my main goal is to find someone with a bad story from Moore-Hill, considering I’ve only ever heard praise from my friends who have lived there. I’d love to read any bad stories tho.

Just remembered I got into some trouble with SJS for showing up drunk in the dorms when I was a freshman. How does this effect my grad school background check?,15,6,"So I’m in the process of applying for grad schook and UT is one of my choices. I was digging through my UTexas email from undergrad earlier today and I saw that I had to meet with SJS during my freshman year many years ago due to a possible violation of the code of conduct . 

I then remembered it was because I came to my dorm super intoxicated and couldn’t swipe in properly. Next thing I remember during that fiasco was that I was in my dorm room and the cops were around me taking my information. I didn’t get cited or anything (which I’m extremely grateful for) but I did get summoned for a meeting with an SJS staff member. Since there was pretty clear evidence that I was intoxicated (dorm front desk, cops, etc) there was no way for me to “deny it”. I was young and didn’t know any better of course (also word of advice don’t eat Thai food and lots of liquor 🙊).
I do remember the punishment was to take an alcohol edu course based on my email (not sure if they do that still).

I know this may sound silly but does anyone know is this stays on your UT record? I got by with the bare minimum punishment (definitely slap on the wrist) luckily but at the end of the day I did “violate the code.”",bmsdfh,UTAustin

I’m not very happy here. I spent a year of my life trying to get into McCombs and it’s not how I expected it to be. I feel like a lot of people are just trying to climb a ladder. Also, I hate the whole networking thing. I’ve only been here for two months, so hopefully things will get better. 


I’m commuting from home and the drive is anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. At my old school, I lived on campus. It took 5 minutes for me to get to my classes and the library. Now, at minimum, it probably takes me an hour to get from my house to the McCombs building or PCL. If I can figure out how to manage my time, commuting will save me so much money. My family is willing to help me get a dorm in west campus, but I don’t want to put that burden on them. 


At this point, I’m not sure if I can pass my classes. On my first round of midterms, I failed 2/3. On the one I didn’t fail, I got a 72. I took another midterm today, and I’m pretty sure I failed it. I have another exam next week worth 25% of my grade. I don’t have very much motivation to study for it, but if I can get it together I can probably pass the class. It’s not that my classes are impossible, I just can’t find enough time or motivation to stay on top of things. 


My mental health has hit a new low. I just want a week to sit back, collect my thoughts, and do nothing. I would really like to withdraw from the university or take a semester off. Also, I’ve been to CMHC, but I didn’t tell them that I’ve thought about killing myself.

I have also paid my $50 on campus application fee. I have now received the housing and dining contract offer and being asked to pay another $300 advance payment. I think I need to do this in case I don't come off the wait list of the private dorm.

"During an inspection, are the residences allowed to look through your drawers/your stuff? What are the protocols?",39,43,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My roommate is honestly kind of shady, so inspectors are checking out our dorm. I don’t know for what reason because he’s not telling me, but that’s that. 

All I know is that they’re supposed to let you know 24 hours in advance before they start the inspection, which they have.

I’m not hiding anything not allowed in the residence, but I do have some valuables and personal items that I would rather not show to the world.

(I know you all probably think it’s something like a dildo or lewd pictures of feet, but no, I have my cat’s ashes in a jar among other things that I don’t wanna explain to the inspectors).

"Rant: Duty Dons got me close to moving outta REV, geez",0,16,"Imma just put this rant here. Feel free to tell me your dorm horror stories in the comments to make me feel better. I’m tired, angry, and petty. 

Alright, so I’m a first year and I live at REV, and right now there’s some bullshit “23-hour quiet time” policy for exams. I get it. It’s a busy time and we’re all first years diving nose deep into our first round of exams. 
Anyways, it’s 12:20 at night, my roommate is gone for the evening, and I’m sleepy as hell. So, I turn on some mindless YouTube comedy or whatever. I don’t want to put in headphones cause, a) I don’t want them to get tangled around my neck if I fall asleep and b) I’m too broke for AirPods. But, I’m not a scumbag, so I put the phone at half volume and call it a night. 
About 15 minutes later, I get a knock on my door. It’s the duty dons. So my half awake ass stumbles out of bed. Their knocking becomes more abrasive, and I tell them to give me a second (to which I could hear the one person outside scoff). I was literally trying to get some pants on. Y’all need to chill.
So, apparently, my phone on half-volume is “too loud”. In my own room. On a Friday night. 
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure there are no exams on Saturday...
So I angrily turn it off and apologize to the duty dons for the noise. 

But then I get to thinking... I live on the corner between my Don and one girl who has a room to herself (her roommate dipped). The wall that my bed is against is nearest to her washroom, so it’s unlikely that the Don heard me and complained. (Plus, she’d just ask me to my face to be quiet... she’s a sweet girl and I feel she’d be kind enough to not make a hassle for the Duty Dons). 
So I’m thinking, it must be my other neighbour. Now this frustrates me, and here’s why:

1. She has repeatedly been loud and had a number of people in her room, to which I have never complained about until last night. (I’ll explain why I complained in point 2.)
2. This morning, my roomie had an exam at 9. My neighbour was being loud af at 11 o’clock at night, so I simply walked over there, knocked on her door, explained my roomie’s situation, and asked her and her friends to quiet down a little. (Her friends didn’t. My roommate just used ear plugs and didn’t complain.)
3. A couple weeks ago I literally fixed her mini fridge out of my own good will. Like... just to be nice. 

If my suspicions are correct (which... cmon. You can’t hear my dinky ass phone playing a YouTube video at half volume down the hall), then this chick really be out here snitching on me after I have literally fixed her fridge. 
I ain’t tryna start beef, but one more arbitrary visit from the duty dons and I’m complaining. I did not pay a stupid amount of money for a weird cinderblock room with shit neighbours and a hallway that constantly smells like ass and weed.",e7akzu,uwaterloo

Some co-op general questions,0,9,"I’m currently a grade 12 student interested in a psychology co-op program, plus I’ve already toured the campus and everything so I’m definitely applying here. I was just wondering a few things about co-op:

1. On the website, it says that your living situation changes every 4 months, what exactly does that entail? What kind of living situation is it and does that mean that I’ll have to move all of the stuff in my dorm to my new living situation and back? 

2. Is co-op worth the extra year if I’m planing to go down a medical route afterwards? My concern was that it’ll take an extra year for me to “start my life” in my career, but will that really matter?

3. What kind of social science co-op jobs are available? I’ve seen in other places that they’re hard to find.

"After almost 9 years of this BMath degree, I FINALLY DID IT REDDIT!!! I'M GRADUATING!!!!!!",590,72,"I started this journey to get my degree back in Fall of 2010....and today it's official....I'm going to be getting my degree this coming June!!!!!!!!! I'm absolutely thrilled. Since I've been here for so long, I've also compiled together this post of a pseudo-summary of some things I wanted to highlight and mention.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG POST INCOMING....

&#x200B;

**N Bad Things I Went Through During My Degree:**

* Nearly failing out completely in first term and being put on academic probation
* Broke up with my high school partner
* My dad's cancer diagnosis and him losing his fight
* Having bronchitis like clockwork almost every 4 months for a period of like, 5 years (it sucked)
* My mental health deteriorating so much that I had to petition to clear an absolutely abysmal term that would have caused me to fail out otherwise

&#x200B;

**N Good Things I Went Through During My Degree:**

* I met and got together with my current partner (we're still together almost 8 years later!)
* I got tested and accommodated for my learning challenges with AccessAbility Services (I would still write that CS 116 midterm again, because having that feeling like I could FINALLY succeed here was WONDERFUL)
* I got the support I needed (after a quite a bit of trial and error) to get my mental health back on track and to finally get some hang of this academic thing
* I switched programs into one I actually enjoyed and could take the courses I actually enjoyed as a result (Math Studies flexibility for the WIIIIIIIIIIIIN)
* I finally left my dorm room and joined some clubs that I loved to be a part of and made friends!

&#x200B;

**N Changes to Math/Campus in General Since My First Year in 2010:**

* M3, QNC and EV3 are no longer under construction and other buildings have popped up
* The approved calculator policy went from having like, 40 calculators to 1 and then to 3 (ZOMG AM I GLAD IT'S 3)
* Pink-tie stickers for approved models of calculators are no longer a thing
* Chocolate bars in the vending machines are no longer $0.75
* JobMine only accepted HTML resumes....but at least it worked reasonably enough
* Most every assignment and work report had to be handed in in a tangible, physical, printed format (now it's like...almost everything is submitted online via Crowdmark)
* OMGUW was the go-to place online for campus shitposting
* The Math Faculty used to automatically exclude fails from your averages and you could choose to exclude courses to keep your average up (they don't do that any more because it was an unfair system prone to abuse and misleading performances)
* WDs are now no longer counted as course attempts (THANK YOU!)
* Communication courses weren't a thing and everyone had to take the ELPE
* Orientation Week was a week long (and I actually had a lot of fun at mine....the events were different which probably helped)
* Suicides are now more talked about on campus (I remember in first year how there was a suicide in residence and how EVERYONE wanted to keep it hush hush to avoid copy cat deaths)
* Probably a lot more, but this is getting pretty damn long now :P

&#x200B;

**N Things that Haven't Changed:**

* The Geese
* PD is still frustrating to complete/get through (would only really taking recommend PD 9 - Ethical Decision Making if you get the chance though)
* Tuition increases (except for the MathSoc fee...in my time here it actually *decreased* for a period of 3 years)

&#x200B;

And now for some academics for the curious....

**Highest Grade**: CO 480

**Honourable Mention for Highest Grade**: My last work report (when work report grades were a thing on your transcript; the grade is actually higher than my highest course grade)

**Favourite Course**: CS 200 (one of, if not, the most USEFUL course too, would highly recommend)

**Least Favourite Course**: CS 436 (flipped classrooms are NOT my style, hated it SO much)

**Lowest Grade**: PHYS 121 (take physics in high school before taking this course my dudes)

**Honourable Mention for Lowest Grade**: STAT 231 (because my final exam grade was not included in the final grade calculation, it WAS eventually corrected, but it's still the lowest final grade I've ever received...lower than my PHYS 121 grade)

**TL;DR** \- A lot of shit happened and changed on campus in the time I've been here, but I'm happy I made it this far and can call myself a true, future Math Alumna!

Feel free to AMA about my time here! I do my best to share from my experiences as honestly as possible (though I may not be able to respond right away, busy day ahead!).

As for what I'm doing next, I'm sticking around for a couple more terms to do some post-degree stuff and take classes I still wish to. Best of luck to all those still trudging along. You will get to wherever you wish to go in your own time, and you are supported <3

EDIT: HOLY HERA!!! Thank you so much for all your well wishes and comments <3 It has been such a joy to read them all. I'm still doing my best to reply to all the questions that are coming in! I write very long things on reddit in general, in case you can't tell, so it may take a bit before I can get back to you. My inbox is open nonetheless, so if there's anything else you'd like to ask feel free to do so! Special shoutout and thank you for the Gold as well! That was quite a surprise. I'm still just so happy that I've made it to this point and I'm so happy I've been able to share it with you. Love and hugs to you all <3",bptqso,uwaterloo

1st Year Math Advice On Etiquette,0,10,"**1. Don't make the rest of the class cringe by asking big brain questions**

When a first-year class starts off with a student asking the prof ""if this obeys the ZFC axioms"" or showing off their knowledge of ""Dedekind cuts,"" you know this student's gonna b cringe. Even the profs know it, as they stare at the student with a face that says *I don't remember asking u a goddam thing* [(photo evidence of prof reaction)](https://i.imgur.com/1vWaB8T.png)

&nbsp;

**2. Don't try to date the TAs, no matter how handsom they are**

I understand that you waterlooers are coming in with... minimal dating experience... but dont make this school more awks. These TAs may just be in their 20s doing their PhDs, but a lot of them are married and ur probably underage anyway. Wait until 2nd year.

&nbsp;

**3. Don't make eye contact with us upper years**

I'm stressed from all the harder courses and the co-op search and I don't need moar stress by being disrespected by frosh. Keep you eyes to yourselves and approach us when you make it past frosh year, froshie. Yeah I know, I used to be a first year too but that was like over 2 years ago and I've now seen the light of the upper yrs.

&nbsp;

**4. If you need to feel the breeze down low, just do it in dorm**

I know the ventilation isnt as good as in your tiny dorm as compared to the outdoors or public places, but the gear lab just isnt the place to put your pants down. We mean no offense and you may be attractive and all down there, but we're just too busy doing actual lab work",cvycyd,uwaterloo

I would really love to have some friends :/,8,2,"Hello all,

Just wanted to vent about my friend situation. During my first year, I literally made no friends. I joined clubs and consistently went every week, talked to people in my dorms, as well as interacted with people in class. I made many many  acquaintances rather than friends. The most we would do was go have lunch together. I literally spent every Friday night alone in my room studying because I never had plans with anyone. Even sometimes I would suggest a plan and they would just awkwardly laugh and kindly decline. I wouldnt say theres really anything wrong with me? I am pretty geeky and do stuff that everyone does like watch movies, binge netflix, and play videogames. I have a good gpa and thats literally all I have going on in my life. My family is half way across the world ( I am Arab) and I have no one here. I am starting second year soon and I tremble at the thought of having no friends for another semester. Most of my acquaintances generally hung out with people from their own demographic which is fine but I just feel so out of place all the time. Can someone give me advice of what to do, beyond the normal "" Go to clubs and talk to people in your classes""? I really just want to learn and change if I have to so please no harsh criticism :(

Thank you, I love you all and I hope you have a great start to your week! :)",cvjg2x,uwaterloo
my 1st yr at waterloo - switching from trent to here and i love it here,184,16,"I switched from trent u (worst experience of my life lol) and transferred here. and i was a bit skeptical because of all the suicides i hear about and its scary academic repuation and how big the school was  but after my first year here, i can really see how they try really hard for their students to succeed and rly love going here lmao

&#x200B;

my first semester here was awful let me tell u. i bombed my first midterm (15%) yep i got a fucking 15 percent LMAO. my parents announced their divorce! my mom was diagnosed with cancer. my hs bf cheated on me LOL !! my dog died!! so yes my mental health was crippling and i stopped going to my classes. i missed about 3 weeks of classes after my midterms and found myself locked in my brick dorm room. 

I then got an email from one of my profs , saying if I was okay because he hasnt seen me in a while (this was a class of 400!!!!) i was a little stunned ya know???? like wtf, i thought they didnt even know me, i never talked in class or ever even approached the guy. he doesnt even take attendance. 

Then my academic advisor emails me a few days later saying a few of my profs were concerned for my absences and was asking if everything was okay and what not. She then gave me resource supports at the school , counselling, therapy , even my don was getting involved. I met with a councillor at needles twice a week and he really helped me sort out my problems and even helped me out organizing and prioritizing my work. My don would check up on me and would just talk things out with me!! i felt very supported . my profs would also check in on me once in a while and ask me what was up

Exams came along and my home life wasnt getting any better , my profs offered extensions and even rescheduling a couple exams for me. i never had this at trent. they kind of ignore mental health altogether. 

&#x200B;

2nd semester was better. i improved a lot and still saw the councillors ! the profs are really flexible with extensions if u tell them what is going on and ask ! when grades came out, i got an email from my academic advisor saying she was very proud of how far i'd come and improved !

I am an international student and I'm not quite sure what to prepare or expect in terms of paperwork (eg student visa) or university workload. I've never been to Canada but I think I'm somewhat familiar with the climate because I come from Switzerland.

I don't have any friends who went to university in Canada (I would've asked them) so I thought I'd ask my doubts here in the hopes that someone might respond. 

Any tips and tricks in terms of choosing a dorm or university in general? Stuff that makes you go ""I wish someone told me this before I started"" haha. or advice for paperwork or university in general? 

Thanks in advance",biagqd,uwaterloo
Updated Pros/Cons of each Res at Waterloo?,4,8,Hey! I'm a long time lurker who just got into engineering and am looking for more information on residences.

Pets in student residences?,2,9,"Long story short, I have pet worms for a vermicomposting system as well as two medicinal leeches for purely educational purposes (and maybe a bit of entertainment), and I’m looking to get a single residence at UofW.

I know that pets aren’t allowed in the residences, but I’d really like to keep these critters and they just kinda sit like sausages in a container. Would they in anyway make an exception to these? 

No one in my family likes touching them and I don’t trust anyone to take care of them either. I know it might gross some people out, but hypothetically if I were to get a dorm room to myself, would this be okay? 

If it makes any difference, I’m an environmental student and I have a huge love for invertebrates; I’m super interested in introducing the topic of vermicomposting to the community. 

This is extra, but I also have a few hundred plants - are plants allowed in the residences? I’m not gonna bring like 500 of them, but I would like to bring some of my favourite ones (20-50 or so? They’re mostly small succulents).

Also wanted to know if anyone knows of any quiet residences with single rooms that’s nearby the campus. I am hypersensitive to certain senses such as noise, smell and touch (artificial light too - I practically live in a void of darkness), with noise being a huge trigger for me (looking to get a diagnosis of some sort soon!). I don’t care about the food part as I’m a picky eater who happens to also be vegan, so I’d prefer to cook for myself anyways.

Potential AFM Student wondering about residency,2,27,"Hi all, I got accepted to UW for AFM and am wondering about which residence I should live in.

I read about V1 and LLC, and wanted to know if it is the best choice. The only thing I don't like is that the meal plan is mandatory, but the dorm consists of a kitchen.

UWP is suite style, however, I heard it would be difficult to meet befriend other people. I also heard about MKV being a very sought after residence. 

I would prefer living in a single room just because I'm a light sleeper, but I would like to meet other people in my dorm as well. I would also like to know about the social and nightlife at Waterloo.

Please let me know the pros and cons and which residence is usually preferred by AFM students, and what would be best for me!",balro0,uwaterloo

Built a University chat website with a Waterloo network!,12,16,"Hey UW!

&#x200B;

In my free time learning how to program React websites I built a University chat website very similar to Slack and Discord. I just created a UW network where you all can go to discuss your courses and anything else going on in Waterloo. It is broken up into three sections:

&#x200B;

Courses: a place to collaborate with your classmates. Courses have two sections - Chat and Questions.

&#x200B;

Channels: Channels can be created for anything! Group projects, hobbies, clubs. For instance, I create some for all the different dorms on campus - V1, REV, MV, etc.

&#x200B;

Direct Message: Single or group chats with your friends

&#x200B;

Let me know if you find it useful or not! Its just a side project so may have some bugs but think you all would find it pretty cool! You can check it out at [skooled.io](http://skooled.io)

Oversea Student Looking for Advice,3,2,"Hello guys,

I am going to start Master of Applied Science in Fall 2019 at ECE. I am an international student and I have never been in Canada before. I will probably arrive the Waterloo at the end of August. I really need your help and advice for anything related to Waterloo and Canada itself. 

I will get a funding around 1200 CAD per month, so can I live with this money? Do you know when the Fall 2019 Tuition fees are announced and will there be any significant increase? I have checked Waterloo's accommodation website and it seems there are some shared rooms whose rent is around 400-700 CAD. What should I specifically look while checking the rooms? I don't want to stay in dormitory because I have been staying in the dorm for 5 years and I am bored of it :)

I really appreciate for your help. I sincerely wish good luck for your exams!

(Story) Mental health is not a joke,595,34,"I was going back to V1 dorms at 1:15 am and i heard this very low crying noise. I looked around and found some dude crying in the corner in the freezing cold at 1:15 fuckin am! I approached him slowly, asked if he was okay and I kid you not, the way he looked at me gave me shivers. I’ve never seen a sadder or more grim look on a human in my life. It looked as if he was soulless. 

After staring at him for a while, i instantly put my hands on his shoulders and he broke down crying. I saw a sharp object in his hands which is when I knew what was happening.

He kept crying, and all i could think about was to take that damn sharp object from his hands. I gave him a hug as he cried, and was very careful at all times on the object’s location. I won’t lie, I was scared shitless. 

I asked him to go into the common room because it was freezing cold, and we went inside. I kept patting him on the back, saying everything was going to be fine, and finally took the sharp object from him.

Then he started to talk, and it broke my heart. His girlfriend had broken up with him a day before Valentine with text, his dad  passed away last week from a car crash, and his mom was in a critical situation from the car crash. He is an international exchange student, and he he hadn’t talked to anyone except the cashier lady in the past two month since he has no friends here.

I talked with him a lot, saying dumb shit like “I am sorry”,  because i couldn’t understand how this human was still functioning after all of this. He seemed very sleepy from crying, so I told him to get sleep, and I promised ill visit him early in the morning to which he agreed.

So why am I writing this? i don’t fucking know. I just felt a heavy load on my heart that I needed to share. Mental health is not a joke, please seek help if you need it and know you’re not alone. ",7ycyap,uwaterloo

"How do I tell my roommate to stop jerking off every night, because he's not subtle about it.",54,21,"So I sharing a dorm with another guy. My roommate is a nice, quite type of guy. In my opinion he can be a pussy at some times and I feel like I could really kick his ass... And to that fact his girlfriend that he's been seriously dating for some time decides she wants a ""break"". This was only a month or so ago, so at the beginning of the year they were bumping uglys and everything was fine.

But now that he's clearly not getting any, I guess he has a bunch of sexual frustration built up. Okay, I get that. BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO JACK OFF WHEN IM TRYING TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU. Even last night, he had a friend over. So two other men in the room besides him. I thought tonight would be the night of peace and quiet. Nope.

How do you start a conversation?,42,42,"Have you ever been in this scenario:

Beginning of term, nobody really knows each other in the class, you're sitting next to someone you have never seen. You want to talk to them but you're not sure what to say. They haven't made any effort to start a conversation with you. You hesitate, what if he doesn't want to talk to me? 

After 10 minutes of careful deliberation and sitting in silence while seemingly everyone else in the class is finding their friends for life, you decide to do it. But then you think how awkward it would be if you were just sitting there silently without moving for 10 minutes and suddenly decide to ask the other guy's name. So you don't do anything instead. You spend the rest of the class thinking about what you could have done. You leave class with no friends and go back to your dorm to masturbate.

So my question is how do you start a conversation? Besides asking their name, asking their program, what else is there to talk about? How do you take the initiative to make friends yourself rather than waiting for others to seek you out?",6psqo8,uwaterloo

PSA for first-years bringing bikes,41,23,"This time of year is the most lucrative for bike thieves because of all the new students who don't know how to keep their bikes from getting stolen. Here are some general tips:

- Don't bring an expensive bike. Sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how many bring their $300+ mountain bikes to campus.
- Use a U lock. Chain locks can be cut in seconds and are essentially useless against a prepared thief.
- If possible, bring your bike indoors behind a locked door. If you really must keep it outside, lock it to a rack that is in view of many dorm windows and such.
- Secure your wheels and seat. If thieves can't take the whole bike, they'll take those. 
- Don't underestimate how fast bike thieves can be. A friend of mine went into a store for 2 minutes and her bike wheels were gone when she came out.
- Lock your bike next to more expensive looking bikes. Alternatively, if you don't care about the appearance of your bike, try to make it look as old and beat-up as possible.
- Write down the serial number so that in the case that it does get stolen, it can be reported to campus police.",6ywh28,uwaterloo

Feeling lonely and out of place?,17,13,"I've been feeling lonely and out of place since university has started.

I've hit an all time low and I don't know where to go from here. I feel like the students around me are much more bright than I am, which is probably why I feel discouraged. I shouldn't have ever got into this university, and it's starting to catch up to me.

I'll explain. Back in high school, I was involved in very little extra curricular activities and didn't have the best grades. I really wanted to get into uw because I thought it would be my only path to be successful. I saw that the co-op program was one of the best parts about uw, and so I applied hoping to get in. I knew that I probably wouldn't make it in due admission averages being at an all time high. So I tried to think about ways to get in but I was losing hope.

I was starting second semester of grade 12 when my friend pointed out to me that I have never thought about before: lying on the AIF. I always thought this was a bad idea because they could easily fact check everything. However, he pointed out that the university has thousands of applications and it would just not be possible to fact check every little thing. He also told me that the math faculty recently put more emphasis on the AIF than in previous years. This got me thinking. If I'm going to get rejected anyways, why not just see how much I can push this theory?

So I got thinking. I was reading some posts on /r/uwaterloo about what other people were putting on their AIF and what to avoid. I started thinking about the recent surge in politics regarding being transgender and affirmative action, so I decided to use this to my advantage. I said that I was transgender on my AIF. But this wasn't the only thing that I put though. I had also put down a couple of (now out of business) startups that I had ""worked"" for. I also boasted on a bunch of other things such as awards, the clubs I was in, etc.. I'm not necessarily proud of this, but it got me what I wanted: cs co-op.

But now I feel like total shit. What if my spot went to another deserving applicant? I'm soon going to be competing for co-op positions relative to my peers, and lying on my resume probably wouldn't get me very far. What I put on my AIF just puts me at the bottom. I feel pretty bad that I did it, and I just feel totally out of place right now. I just started my first CS 135 class today, and EVERYBODY but me looked as if they belonged there. Like holy fuck. I also felt down by the course material. The way my professor was talking about java today really put me down. This is the only language I know. But anyways that was not really related to this. I just wanted to vent because I don't know who else to talk to other than my friend who lied on his AIF too.

I don't know if I should come clean about this, and even if I did, I don't know who to come clean to. Should I just continue at uw or would it be just better to withdraw? I'm pretty scared if one day one of the security guards will just knock down my dorm door with the math dean coming in and telling me to get out of this university. I'm pretty scared and I don't know what to do. What do, uwaterloo reddit?",6yrmrx,uwaterloo
Bad insomnia staying in Res?,5,9,"I've been staying in V1 since September, And I've been having the worst insomnia of my life. When I simply can't fall asleep, I wake up several times throughout the night, or when I sleep the whole night, I wake up feeling as dogshit tired as when I haven't.

I've tried practically every remedy I can think of. I've tried drinking hot tea, taking a hot shower, a cold shower, meditation/breathing exercises, humidifier, dehumidifier, air purifier(I have a few allergies), nothing seems to resolve the problem for more than a week. My latest endevour has been taking melatonin tablets, but now it seems like those are now failing me too.

Occasionally I'll have periods of sustainable sleep (if I didn't I probably would have dropped dead months ago), but these are always interspersed with poorer periods, and they range in severity very erratically (it has no bearing on midterm season, exams, etc).

Last semester I booked an appointed with a doctor with health services, but he basically just recited the 'Clean up your sleep hygiene and exercise more' mantra that I've read about on the internet a million times during sleepless nights, and that I have been doing since before this began. When I tried to ask him about other factors he just carted my off.

The weirdest thing is that this ONLY happens in my dorm room. I've slept in numerous hotels and family's homes and had practically zero prior incidences of insomnia. Even when I went home for reading week, I instantaneously slept soundly in my own bed, and the night I went back to res the next week it resumed just as seamlessly (Which I think contradicts the idea that the cause is somehow psychological).

At this point I'm starting to regret choosing to stay in res, as it's made my life objectively worse. The reason I didn't move out last semester is because I would've felt bad having wasted my parents money on the fees.

Has anybody else had a similar experience staying in res, or have an idea as to what's going on?

"""Is it uncommon to spend most of your time alone?"" & ""Is anyone else feeling off their game lately?"" post update a year later",131,19,"Howdy, I wrote those two posts awhile ago under throwaways. Those posts got a good amount of commiseration and input from those who felt similar and now I would like to present an update for those who identify with those experiences.

I am a senior now; I am set to graduate in the spring (or maybe next fall lol). Since making those posts I have done a lot of personal growth and I can take a retrospective on my college experience. It turns out I spent a good portion of it in a toxic mindset. I was jealous of everything; students with better cars, better grades, people talking about parties in class, couples, etc. It got to a point Sophomore year that I never left my dorm. I didn't start out like that but after frustration and set back it escalated into a vicious cycle of resentment and self imposed isolation. That misery continued until I just poured myself into my studies and then Junior year rolled around. 

I started that year with a chip on my shoulder but I met a girl in one of my classes that I got along with. Long story short we became friends then more than friends then a couple. During that time I had thought I had gotten the thing that I had wanted for a long time, a relationship. Little did I understand that a relationship or a girlfriend is not just a thing to possess but a decision to nurture. In the Spring my roommates signed a lease for the next year without me; due to the (rightful, in hindsight) perception that I was using them and taking them for granted. This was the writing on the wall. A few months later my girlfriend broke up with me in large part because of my possessiveness and deluded paranoia about her cheating. 

In retrospect, I can see that I had convinced myself into thinking that if I had a girlfriend or more friends that I would magically feel better. The truth is that I was angry and insecure and I brought those into the relationships (romantic/friendships) I managed to stumble into. I just about had it. Last summer I attended an intensive 5 week long DBT group therapy session; I plunged myself into kayaking with an old friend. I spent a lot of time articulating my thought patterns, I began to notice what specific things sent me down loops and just by recognizing my ""triggers"" it became much easier to get a grip on myself.

This semester is another world; I'm not exactly a social butterfly by nature but I have nurtured the friendships I do have and have planted a few new ones. If you told me Sophomore year that my Ring Dunk would be crowded by friends and family I would have called you a liar. I am still anxious about post-graduation, however this is much easier to deal with now that I am more comfortable with myself. It is true that your college experience is what you make of it, and it is never too late to improve yourself. If I had any real advice it would be to approach everything as a learning opportunity and to not take the relationships in your life for granted.",djsysx,aggies

101 Things I Learned in 4 Years at Texas A&M University: Some Lessons from a Senior,1221,187,"1.	An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal.

2.	However, we do elaborate, collaborate, and borrow.

3.	If you learn from textbooks, then buy them. Otherwise get them from somewhere less wholesome.

4.	Never buy an out-of-major textbook.

5.	On the 8th day, God created Chegg, and he saw that it was good. It's worth the subscription.

6.	Most online quizzes are on Quizlet.

7.	If you're templating, there is no .cpp file other than main. It all goes in a .h.

8.	When doing MindTap for CHEM 101/102/107, miss the question first, take a screenshot (WIN+PrtScn), then retry it with the tutorial it just showed you.

9.	Never take Thomás Erdelyi for anything.

10.	Don't pick an awful schedule ”for the meme of it.”

11.	Third floor men’s restroom in the Academic building: poop with a view.

12.	Basement level ladies restroom in the MSC(if I remember correctly): weird skirt toilet!

13.	The best water fountain on campus is the one on the first floor of the Reed McDonald building.

14.	Dining Dollars aren't real money. What comes from your debit card is. Shop at the Aggie Express for soft drinks/snacks – not vending machines.

15.	The Aggie Express in the MSC is not an Aggie Express and you cannot use Dining Dollars there.

16.	Freshmen tend to have way too many Dining Dollars. Mooch off them aggressively.

17.	Buy all of your scantrons and blue books in the first week of school and leave them in a folder in your backpack.

18.	Don't walk on Walton Hill.

19.	Don't leave your backpack on the ground every night. A spider could crawl in it and lay eggs over the weekend.

20.	You are allowed to hiss other Ags. In fact, other Ags are the second best demographic to hiss.

21.	Don't “boo"" or do the “bullshit” chant at football games. You look dumb and the school gets in trouble.

22.	Bring a towel to the Rec.

23.	At the Rec, NO ONE IS LOOKING AT YOU. If you're fat but you're trying to get swole, good for you. But no one cares or thinks less of you. Go improve that bod.

24.	Similarly, if you fall (off your bike, skateboard, or just walking) and totally eat it, don't be embarrassed. Accept help and check if you ripped your pants. No one will remember that happened to you.

25.	Feeling down? There’s a ramp that leads out of the Quad that Zips like to slide down in their boots, and 40% of the time they fall right on their faces. Good for a quick laugh.

26.	Hide a pillow and a blanket in the stacks in the library. Sometimes you just need a quick nap. 

27.	Being sick only works in your favor if you go to the Quack Shack and get an excuse. Otherwise, go sit in class, get the notes/assignments, and be sad. 9/10 times, I pick the latter.

28.	You don't NEED to go to class or even take notes or even pay attention! But you need to have the ability to gain the information you missed. Plan accordingly.

29.	Bus 26 goes by Whitney's. If you need a good, $14 haircut, go there.

30.	Fuego will always be closed on Monday and Chik-fil-A will always be closed on Sunday. 

31.	You can ask for a drink cup full of Layne's sauce for less than $3. Bone apple teeth.

32.	Fazzoli's has a pasta trio deal on Tuesdays. Lot of food for very cheap.

33.	Learn to cook for yourself. A great way to start is by getting a crock pot. Put stuff in, start the timer, go to class, and come back to a meal that can be enjoyed for multiple days.

34.	The cat box is located on the Aggie North side of Heldenfels. Go look at the cats, don't get bit by the opossum.

35.	Learn the Aggie directions! Pointing at University (Northgate) is Aggie North, Texas runs along Aggie East, George Bush is Aggie South, and Wellborn is Aggie West.

36.	If you see someone with a visitor's sticker, say howdy and ask if you can direct them to something. It's what we do here and it means a lot.

37.	Don't be mean to visiting football fans, especially about taking their hats off in the MSC. Ask them to uncover politely.

38.	Old Army sits down after the band plays and doesn't stand back up until the clock reads 15:00.

39.	We all know that A-R-M-Y spells Army. This isn't a spelling bee.

40.	If you sit on deck 3, row 1 at Kyle Field, you may hit the 12th Man sign as much as you want.

41.	Texas A&M is a baseball school.

42.	Go see people play other sports like basketball, baseball, softball, and soccer. Softball is my personal favorite. 

43.	The Cowboys and the Texans aren't rivals, so stop acting like it.

44.	The Rangers and the Astros are rivals, and you may act like it.

45.	Hockey sucks but it's a sport we play t.u. in so go support them.

46.	When you sit next to someone you don't know in class, ask them their name, hometown, and major (assuming you aren't in a specific 400 level class). People like to feel that others are interested in who they are.

47.	Suck at meeting new people and are generally shy? Offer someone gum! It'll prompt the other person to initiate the conversation and takes a lot of pressure off of you.

48.	Aim to make your close, in major friends by your 4th semester. That way you’ll have your clan of people who can all “compare” answers with you when classes actually get hard.

49.	Classes get harder.

50.	Classes get WAY harder.

51.	You will be in groups for projects where you don't have the ability/knowledge to contribute much, and that's okay. Just try to make your team's life as easy as you can.

52.	YOUR GPA, GOOD OR BAD, DOES NOT DEFINE YOU.

53.	FAILING A CLASS DOES NOT MAKE YOU A FAILURE. You get to decide if you are a failure with your attitude. 

54.	Q dropping is okay. There isn't some almighty, destructive intergalactic being you are keeping at bay by staying in that class that you are 100% going to fail.

55.	Contrary to popular belief, there are stupid questions. Professors all have different tolerances for them though.

56.	Previous class records (anex.us/grades/) are the Bible for picking classes.

57.	If Anex is the Bible, then Rate My Professor is the Book of Mormon.

58.	On TurnIt In, you always have to hit submit one more time than you think you have to.

59.	WEAR. DEODORANT. 

60.	Keep deodorant, a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss sticks, and Ibuprofen in your backpack and thank me later.

61.	Men: shave. If you want people to take you seriously, you need to keep your hair well kept.

62.	Ladies: shave. I get it. Gender norms be damned, but if you want people to take you seriously, you need to keep your hair well kept.

63.	Also ladies: you get to decide if you want to wear makeup. And if someone asks if you are sick, don’t bite their head off. You should have days where you want to impress and days where you just need to be you.

64.	In your house/apartment/dorm, always have 5 things: rope, duct tape, WD-40 (or some lubricant), a lighter, and a really good knife. With these, you could solve world hunger.

65.	Cheat sheets are best when hand written. Write them on card stock and use a 0.4mm or smaller pen. They will look neater and can be passed down.

66.	If you insist on working/studying to music, use a non-vocal album. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSa1OUhsEnc&t=5s is an excellent place to start.

67.	Hand write your notes. Seriously. Unless you have something that makes it difficult for you to write or understand written notes, then hand write your notes.

68.	When you leave the MSC, ask yourself, “Did I wear a hat today?”

69.	Your professors don’t have to play fair. 

70.	Political debates are not worth your effort unless it is for a PoliSci class. If someone disagrees with you, that is okay. The world is going to keep on spinning. 

71.	Find your study space on campus. Pick somewhere you “like” going to. That doesn’t have to be the library. If you don’t want to spend all of your time there, then don’t. Find your own place. Mine is now the garden terrace at ZACH.

72.	Speaking of ZACH, never get too attached to a building. Chances are Sharp will tear it down to build a hotel over it.

73.	There is a beach volleyball net just north of Haas hall.

74.	Group chats are not sacred. Assume anything you write in one is being broadcasted to your fun uncle: he lets you get away with more than your parents but still keep it SFW.

75.	Believe in something that lacks tactility and is bigger than yourself. If you’re Christian, that’s God. If you’re of another theistic religion, it’s who you believe in. If you’re not any of those, believe in yourself and the capacity you have for greatness.

76.	All of you have the capacity for greatness. I have never met an Aggie who didn’t. You just have to figure out what greatness means to you.

77.	Find your “Prometheus speech.” Dr. Shell in the Computer Science department explains on his first day of classes every semester why he loves what he does. I have since adopted it and it goes something like this: “I love Computer Science. The power that we have today seems like fiction from the point of view of 1900’s smartest man. This unbridled power we have created for ourselves is truly like Prometheus stealing fire from the gods. We have the ability harness such an amazing thing. And every day I do my job, I get to control that power.” It’s pretentious and uncomfortably poetic, but if you can’t get passionate about what you do, then you might want to rethink doing it for the next 40 years.

78.	It’s okay to change majors. It’s okay to be here for more than 4 years. 

79.	 Procrastinating is a part of life. I’m doing it as I write this. It’s okay to procrastinate, but you need to know how to jump back onto your work when your laziness itch has been scratched.

80.	Playing video games and binging Netflix are two dangerous actions. I have seen more people drop out of college over their relationship with these two things than anything else. This isn’t high school. Figure out a new relationship with these time wasters.

81.	This isn’t high school, so don’t wear your letterman or your high school ring or I and everyone else are liable to bully you.

82.	In the parking garages, never pull your car through. They ticket for that here.

83.	Advisors can do anything if you cry enough.

84.	An 8 AM with friends is never worth it.

85.	You can write on mirrors with dry erase markers. Keep track of your weight, set daily reminders, or even write little pick me up messages for when you feel down.

86.	You will hurt in college. You are going to want to scream and cry and that is okay. Grieving is not a waste of time but wallowing in self pity is. 

87.	You will pull all-nighters. You are allowed to complain. I highly suggest Starbucks Doubleshots or 5-Hour Energies to keep you going. Just remember if you start feeling an irregular heartbeat, consume more water. 

88.	Relationships can end. Don’t define your life by them. Doing so is a great way to make yourself socially retarded (as in, the dictionary definition). In college, your choices need to be motivated by your own self first, then your significant other, but don’t abuse that.

89.	A little guilt goes a long way. If you start feeling guilty about not studying or about failing an assignment or not spending enough time with friends, you will end up punishing yourself for something that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn’t really matter.

90.	You don’t always have to go out with friends if you don’t want to. If you want to study, do it.

91.	You still do need to go out with friends. Learn when to put your pencils down.

92.	Any struggle you are having, someone around you is having. One of the best things about the Aggie family is that the vast majority of people in it actively want to help each other out. You can depend on them. Conversely, if someone needs someone to talk to, be that person. My best friendships came from being on either side of that situation.

93.	Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. 

94.	Go to Aggie Muster/Silver Taps/Bonfire Remembrance. Visit the Hall of Honor. Stand under the Albritton Tower. Hallow your time. Honor those who came before you.

95.	If Reveille barks, your professor doesn’t have to dismiss the class. This does, however, make your professor a 2%er.

96.	The fastest way from the MSC to the Engineering block (ZACH, HRBB, the Stripper Pole, the ETB (also known as the Emerging Tears Building), etc.) is to walk along to Trigon, then take a right into the Heldenfels parking lot, walk by the cat box, through the library breeze way under the sky bridge, left at the Liberal Arts building, and then you’re at the engineering block. You’re welcome.

97.	If someone bangs out a “Hullabaloo Caneck Caneck” in your classroom before or after class and you can whoop, then WHOOP. Be warned that this can prompt a professor to split up you and some friends like you were 3rd graders.

98.	If you are holding a sign outside of the MSC or wherever, pay attention to who is wearing an Aggie ring. They are probably seniors who don’t have any reason to listen to what you have to say.

99.	Do not forget the water when cooking Easy Mac. Failure to do so will make a lot of people in your dorm very angry with you if it is 3 AM and raining and 50 degrees outside.

100.	Center your life on 6 things: Excellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service. They’re the Core Values for a reason.

101.	Enjoy yourself now. Your time here is short. When you leave, there is no more Aggie legacy for you to make. If you want to be remembered, you have to do something worthy of remembrance.

Edit: My goodness, this is now the most upvoted thing here. Crazy stuff. To be perfectly honest, I wrote this all out of a really sad place. My personal life had really gone down hill what with my girlfriend of six years breaking up with me in January. Tack onto that the fact that I was going to lose two very important identities after I graduate: an Aggie and a Singing Cadet. I think I just wanted someone to listen to what I had to say. I wanted to tell people how to keep from making my mistakes and how to enjoy the things I enjoyed. I don't know if I can express here how depressed I've been in this, my last semester. Furthermore, I know I didn't fully express my mind with this list. I have LOTS of other stories and tips that I might could go on forever about. But when I leave Aggieland and when I step away from the Singing Cadets, I will be proud to know the kinds of people who will take my place. When I'm having a tough day, I like to just read all these comments about everything from old Ags and their times here to incoming freshmen who now stand where I once did. It brings me such joy to know others have felt the Aggie Spirit the same way I have. I know it's gonna take a bit to fix myself. When I have lost hope for myself, the Aggie family has spared me some of theirs and I feel like I can make it. But when I walk the stage come May, and I get my diploma, and it's time for me to return home, I'm gonna go back knowing that I returned with honor. After all the screaming and crying - after all the sleepless nights and the fits of depression - after that one time that I got locked in Evans and had to call campus PD to let me out - I will have returned with honor. Thanks, Ags! Love you guys!",alo68k,aggies

An Anxious Freshman,32,18,"Howdy,

I'll be starting my first semester at Aggieland in general engineering in a few weeks and I'm very scared/anxious about a few things. 

1. I honestly feel like I am under qualified and not smart enough to survive the rigor of A&M engineering. Even though I passed my mpe, I studied kind of excessively and didn't even get that high of a score. It seems to me that all the other engineering students are much more intelligent than me which scares me.

2. It may sound common, but I'm worried I will have trouble making friends. At my nsc, I talked to a few people but didn't really make many friends. I saw people making friends left and right like it was nothing and I just wondered, how? I just really don't want to be that one student that stays in his dorm all the time because I'm lonely.

3. ETAM. I want to major in either MEEN or AERO and I know how hard these majors are to get into. I'm worried if I don't get a 3.5, I'll get a major I don't want which I will be stuck with.

I know I sound like the stereotypical whining freshman, but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!",cnzo7a,aggies

Edit: Also a social issue if yall have any advice. I am in engineering and I dorm in the LLP in the commons, so basically around other engineers. Though I thought it would be a good way for me to connect with others, people here are not social. I try to start conversations around my dorm and in my classes but either it gets really awkward or their interests are completely different from mine(I'm not good at super smash bros is what im saying). And in I've made some acquaintances in my class but again for some reason its really hard to keep a conversation going with them. On the other hand when I go up to northside everyone seems to be extremely social. Any advice?",dgpu6l,aggies

Anyone else get depressed when it’s time to come back to school?,148,60,"I’m a freshman in engineering. I’m taking 17 hours this semester because for ETAM to biomed I have to take chem 2 and the lab on top of everything else. Plus I’m taking some core curriculum requirements and the seminar required for engineering honors. It feels like all I do at school is work. Nonstop. I even had to pull an all-nighter one night the week before spring break. I’m also pretty introverted and I really only have one good friend that I hang out with (with the little time that I have). My tiny dorm room feels like a prison and my silent roommate is literally always there so I never have any time to myself. Every day feels the same: I go to all my classes (and I have early morning classes so I’m also always struggling to get up in the morning), which takes up the majority of my day, then I go back to my prison to work on the boatload of school work I have to do, and go to bed. I maybe have a little bit of free time to watch YouTube each day, and going to eat somewhere outside of my dorm and maybe watching a TV show is the most fun I have throughout the week. While A&M is an amazing school and all, I’ve come to realize I think I genuinely hate my college experience so far. I have no quality of life because I have so much work and I can’t make any friends. Whenever it’s time to come back to school after a break (Thanksgiving, winter, spring breaks) I can’t help but feel so depressed about going back. Any freshmen feel the same way? Any upperclassmen have similar experiences, and did it get better?

General Questions about the Campus,10,13,"Hi fellow aggies! 

&#x200B;

I'll be an incoming first year and just had a few questions since I've never visited A&M before.

1. How convenient is it to drive around campus?
2. Where do I go for official tours during the summer? Like mid-June? 
3. What type of parking pass/permit would you recommend purchasing for somebody who likes to go to the gym daily and potentially study at the library (don't know the names of their libraries)? 
4. Favorite spots on campus to eat??",bw0xrc,aggies
Engineering Laptop - Any issues with a 4K display?,18,25,"I'm helping my daughter shop for a laptop to start engineering in the Fall.  She'll have a desktop that is pretty potent for gaming in her dorm, so we've steered away from a ""gaming laptop"" option.  I've focused more on something reasonably light so she'll be OK carrying it around, and also good battery life so she can leave the charger back at the dorm.

&#x200B;

Looking through the various options, I've been narrowing it down to the Dell XPS 15.  Microcenter has these two options for the same price:

&#x200B;

 [https://www.microcenter.com/product/507501/xps-15-9570-156-gaming-laptop-computer---silver](https://www.microcenter.com/product/507501/xps-15-9570-156-gaming-laptop-computer---silver) 

&#x200B;

 [https://www.microcenter.com/product/507461/xps-15-9570-156-gaming-laptop-computer---silver](https://www.microcenter.com/product/507461/xps-15-9570-156-gaming-laptop-computer---silver) 

&#x200B;

They're labeled as ""gaming laptops"" by microcenter, but a 1050ti card is going to be good for fairly basic gaming at best.

&#x200B;

The only functional difference between the two is the 2nd one has a 4K display (with touch screen) and the 1st has a 1080p (no touch screen).  The 2nd also has Win 10 Home instead of Pro, but I don't see that will make a difference in this case.

&#x200B;

The 4K display is going to cost a bit of run time since it will put a bigger drain on the battery.  Still, it should be good for 6-7 hrs of normal usage (the 1080p will get closer to 10 hrs).

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm leaning toward getting the 4K version as everything I've read suggests it's an all around better display and I expect it will last her longer in general.  Is there anything from an engineering curriculum or software standpoint that should keep me from getting her the 4K version?

My family is very curious about seeing where I’ll be living my first year of college, I guess move in day in August feels too far away! I looked on the website for Davis Gary and there were pictures of the hallways but nothing else really. There was a picture of a dorm room, but it had two beds in it and two males, which seems wrong because Davis Gary is all single rooms and all female (with the exception of a few apartments, but I’ll be staying in a single room). 

I’d really love to hear what people have to say about living here. Like things about how comfortable it is, how crowded, how loud, how clean, etc. 

Also, I applied for a parking pass for the parking lot right outside of Davis Gary hall- did anyone have trouble getting the lot they wanted or do you typically get your requested lot? That was kinda a side thought, I might need to ask on a separate post about the parking pass haha.

Question to current students - mental health,5,4,"Tech has had a reputation for high attrition and unhappy students since long before I started there in the mid 90's.  A large portion of the issues when I was there fell under tough curriculum,  partially indifferent faculty (this varied greatly from department to department and staff person to staff person), relative lack of avenues as an outlet and workload.

I started under the quarter system, which more or less forced students to get their ish together within the first week of class because the first test was typically during the 2nd or 3rd week.

I read a lot on here and in random zuckerberg nyetwork posts about the mental health issues.   There wasn't a true central forum where the issues could be discussed back then (the git.\* newsgroups weren't frequented by all that many students and online social media consisted of ICQ/AIM chats).

&#x200B;

Is the situation worse now, or does it just have a more noticeable presence?  Campus has come a long way since then, and even though Atlanta isn't the ""it"" city it was in the early to mid 90's, there are way more amenities, activities and access to a larger portion of it than the end of the last century (E3 and on the bricks concerts notwithstanding).

&#x200B;

It seems like the food situation has taken a turn for the worse, but there were maybe 5 spots total to get food back then.  Brittain, Woodruff, Student center (food court and that restaurant on the 3rd floor) and the Athletic Association if you were an athlete (or post the NCAA ruling that they had to allow general access at least some of the time).  Everything else was a hodge podge of clubs, professional society chapter meetings or Tech sponsored events.  Atlantic station was largely a wasteland.  You guys seem to have at least some access to food trucks, door dash, uber eats, etc.   One of my roommates who stayed on campus during thanksgiving ate my tostitos for thanksgiving dinner because he had no access to a car.  I feel like he'd have had more options available nowadays.

&#x200B;

Anyways, so what gives?   Things always look better in hindsight, but I remember the ever present stress, the guilt of not spending every waking moment studying, doing homework, or engaging in other academic pursuits to bolster my grades  or knowledge.  I also remember wishing I could just graduate and be done with tests forever every single dead week.  It definitely broke some of us mentally.  I can think of one or two dorm mates that just left campus mid-term after struggling... and hearing from others who made plans to do so after the quarter/semester was over due to personal or academic issues. 

&#x200B;

Besides asking whether the climate has worsened, I am also asking how many of you believe that students should be able to lean hard on the administration for mental well being and therapy services.     My classmates at the time would have scoffed a bit at the idea.... thinking it akin to asking your abuser to offer therapy for the abuse that they themselves were administering.   No, petting a dog for a few minutes isn't going to give respite from lab reports, coding assignments or a series of major tests....  but I'm not sure what else the administration could really offer?   The odds that they are going to lighten the academic load, ask professors to be more circumspect about the quality of instruction and make campus an easier place to thrive with less energy & effort from the undergrads across the board seems preeeetty far fetched.

&#x200B;

It seems like a semester away or a co-op/internship would be a more effective fix than anything Tech could practially offer.

A Firsthand Account of What GT Mental Health Services Are Really Like (Long Post),364,35,"So, this happened to me last year. Some people who know me already know this story and, no, this account is not a throwaway. I figured people should hear my story from me directly. 

I’m a second year at Tech, and right off the bat, my first year started off poorly. A lot of factors were at play, but perhaps the most notable is the fact that I had untreated Depression and Anxiety (and as I’d later find out, OCD and ASD). 


FIRST HOSPITALIZATION:

About a week after my 18th birthday, I set out pills to take with the intention of ending my life. I was so lonely, so hopeless, and overwhelmed in every aspect of my life. However, I started imagining what would happen if I took the pills, panicked, and called the counseling center instead. After telling them what was happening, I was told to come to their office in the flag building. I Ubered there as I was a mess and didn’t want to be seen on the bus. I didn’t pack anything except a favorite ring of mine, and my dad’s jacket that he passed down to me. 

When I got to the counseling center, I’d say it was maybe a 20 minute wait before I was called back into one of the therapists’ offices. A lady took notes as she asked me what was happening, and then she told me what a 10-13 was. Now, for you fortunate folks who *don’t* know, this is when you are involuntarily checked in to a mental health facility for a minimum of 72 hours and must be escorted to said facility (in my case, by GTPD in a squad car). Remember this for later. 

I panicked. I didn’t want my parents to know what had happened. I knew they’d be so upset with me. I begged the therapist not to make me go. I didn’t want to miss class, I felt like I was already behind! I didn’t have any extra clothes or possessions to take with me! 

I didn’t have a choice. I was sent off to Ridgeview in Smyrna, where I stayed for either 4-5 days (to be honest, I’ve tried to repress the memories of my time there so I don’t remember exactly how long it was).

It was awful. The staff as apathetic, we had to turn in everything (including my dad’s jacket and my ring), we couldn’t have any devices (which I somewhat understand, but since music is what calms me down most, this sucked), the group sessions were more traumatic than helpful, the food was awful, and I felt even worse than I had before. I remember on my first night that I was snapped at and sent to sit out in the hall for crying in my bed. 

Finally, I was given a prescription for a low dosage of Prozac and released. When I got back to campus, I had a couple hundred pages of reading, assignments, tests, and more to make up. Though the Dean of Students office was great about helping me arrange makeup work (Dean Riggle deserves tons of praise here), I still knew that missing so much class would hurt me. I don’t learn from reading textbooks. I learn from hearing lectures and demonstrations. 

SECOND HOSPITALIZATION:

It wasn’t long before I noticed that my medication didn’t seem to be working. I fell back into my depressive habits. I wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, couldn’t get myself out of bed, and “those thoughts” started coming back. 

One night, a month after my first hospitalization, I was studying for a big test. I had missed multiple lectures in this class while I was gone and from physically not being able to get myself out of bed to go to class. I realized I felt completely unprepared, panicked, and felt so trapped that I could only see death as a way to get out of the situation. I tried to hang myself, but the attempt failed. 

My roommate heard me crying in my room (apartment style dorm). She didn’t know I had attempted, but she texted me and recommended that I go talk to the Sports Psychologist the next day. I did. With only the clothes on my back and my backpack, I went to their office. Apparently, they had already spoken to my roommate, and knew that I had been upset. They asked if I had been suicidal again. I tried not to panic. I knew what would happen if I told the truth. I’d be shipped away again, I’d get the same terrible treatment, I’d feel even worse again. I refused to answer the question. 

They told me that since they had concern about me hurting myself, I would need to go to a facility. However, I was assured that I could go get evaluated voluntarily and be driven by my coaches instead of the police. I agreed to this. A few minutes later, I’m suddenly told that, no, that’s actually not what’s happening, I’m being 10-13’d again. I ask, “Doesn’t that mean a mandatory 72 hours?” I’m told that no, it doesn’t. Everything is the same, I’ll just have to have the GTPD escort me again. 

I’m hesitant, but I don’t really have a choice. I’m led through the tunnels of Bobby Dodd and put into yet another squad car. This time I’m taken to Peachford in Dunwoody. I wait for about two hours until I’m called back to be evaluated. This is when I find out that I was, in fact, correct. Despite being previously told by Sports Psychology that I would not have to stay 72 hours, Peachford informs me that this is exactly what I will be doing. 

I break down in the evaluation room. I literally felt like I had been taken prisoner. My anxiety attack was so severe that the staff threatened to take me to the stabilization unit if I didn’t calm down. I wasn’t violent. I was scared. Imagine just thinking you’re going on a trip to the doctor and you’re suddenly told that you’re to be locked in an institution and aren’t allowed to leave or have any of your things, including a change of clothes, for days. 

It was like an actual nightmare. Thankfully, Peachford wasn’t quite as bad as Ridgeview. It was still bad, but the staff at least seemed less cruel, and the food was pretty good compared to the Ridgeview prison slop. One of the times that I got to use the pay phone, I called the Sports Psychologist and asked why I’d been given misleading information. I reminded them that I had explicitly asked if a 10-13 would be 72 hours and was told no. They told me that “Well, it’s supposed to be 72 hours, yes, but a doctor *could* release you early.” I asked the doctor about this, and was told that no doctor would ever do that, because a 10-13 was always 72 hours. I felt very lied to and betrayed. 

When I was released again, I decided that maybe some of my stress could be alleviated if I dropped a class. On top of this, I had mandatory therapy and psychiatry appointments. However, on a particularly rough day, I found myself needing counseling when I didn’t have a therapy appointment scheduled. I dropped by the counseling center instead. I was led down the hall of roaring white noise machines (which I personally dislike) and into a therapist’s office. I told her about what had happened, and how I felt overwhelmed with stress again. I was still struggling to sleep, and had been bouncing around on different prescriptions to see what actually worked, which was taking a physical toll. 

She looked at me and shrugged. 
“What do you want *me* to do about it?” 
I stared at her. 
“Pardon?”

I know this is a long post with details that probably nobody cares about. I’ve just been needing to get this off my chest. It wasn’t linear progress for me from there by any means. Lately, things have become overwhelming again, and I often feel very alone. I want to make friends, but feel like I’m more of an annoyance to people than a potential a friend. 

It hurts my heart every time I hear or read that GT loses another student. I know I don’t have all the answers to fixing the glaringly obvious issues surrounding mental health care at Tech, but I can say with absolute certainty that things will never improve if the attitude towards the issue is a shrug and a “What do you want *me* to do about it?” 

Maybe it’s up to us students. We need and deserve for this to be fixed. I’d like to encourage everyone to try to remind someone that they matter in a *personal way.* Also, some of you are already pretty good about this, but I think we should all be more open about talking seriously about our own mental health. I know with the good ol’ Gen Z humor it’s easy to just make memes about having depression, but if we all fight the stigma just a little bit with honest conversation and being willing listeners, I think it could make a world of impact. 

Some mental health days and more student-professor communication about mental health could also potentially do a world of good. 

If nothing else is fixing this, I guess it’s up to us.",dewve3,gatech
Anyone interested in making GT Emergency Medical Services?,95,33,"During my freshman year, my friend twisted her ankles on the stairs at like 3 am and she was unable to walk.

Why don't we create a GT chapter of emergency medical services (like other schools) where there's always a student on shift to provide to help those students? We can start off with helping GTPD during school events and such.

That being said, tech is a decent financial burden on my family. My parents are willing to invest in me, but I can see how it affects them and how every dollar counts.

Most of my friends are planning to live on west campus apartments next year, but they cost a whopping $3k more per year than dorm living. I've spoken with my parents about the cost to gain their opinion, and they've said they're willing to pay if it really is a good option.

Mold/Mildew/Environmental Growth,86,7,"Regardless of what GT Housing decides to call it year after year, the mold problem prevalent in GT dorms is a problem.

I've been sick for the past month and a half and have been struggling in classes because of it. At such a prestigious school, where I work two jobs and am a full time student (so I have absolutely no time to be sick), you'd think Tech would put a little more emphasis on taking care of our health so we can perform well. But alas, their solution is what? Change the name from ""mildew"" to ""environmental growth"" and sweep the problem under the rug yet again.

I'm tired of housing treating their employees poorly.

What GT does when you have a mental breakdown.,368,42,"First off, I don’t want to scare anyone away from help.  Get help, but avoid campus resources for now.  You do not want them involved in your mental health;  find a private counselor, a good friend, a professor, or if you’re feeling worse than all of that:  Take an Uber to the hospital (PM me and I’ll even pay for the uber)

That having been said, here’s what you can expect if you let GT get involved:

In early spring ‘18, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and I called the “counselor on call” at Georgia Tech.  I told them my situation and they *offered* a ride to Ridgeview institute.  I accepted, as an uber would have been expensive.  I could have said no and went home, meaning I was not an involuntary transport.  GTPD was chill and understanding, and we had good conversation on the way over.  But my mistake was that the GT bureaucracy was now involved.

My time at ridgeview was acceptable, and is not my main concern.  I worked honestly and exerted  effort with professionals I felt could make my mental health improve.  I was discharged 5 days later.  In my discharge paper, there was an exclusionary option for release of records; I filled it in with a few substances I was or had been on.  I signed the records to be sent to the GT counseling department, because I was told they’d want to do their own evaluation.

Upon my return, I was mandated to return to the dean of students before I could even attend class or return to a dorm.  Even before I could see the counselor I was required to see.  I set a meeting and the next day I arrived and she had in front of her my entire discharge manual.  This person, who had no medical or counselor training had my blood pressure, medicines, therapy notes, dietary observations, *and* the list of drugs I specifically prohibited to be on *ANY* discharge paper.

Her first words were “you need to get off of the xxxxx if you want to stay here.”  No “glad you’re better” “I hope you’re Ok.”

She asked me if I considered a retroactive withdrawal (withdrawing unconditionally from all classes for the semester), but I had professors who were willing to work with me over the coming summer to clean up the work I had missed.

I still don’t know where my discharge records are.  I missed the 180 day deadline to file a complaint to the HIPPA officials, so I guess I’ll never know.

tl;dr needed help, contacted GT, took their advice, got better, signed exclusionary discharge forms to counselors office, entire booklet ends up at dean of students’.",d3m8jx,gatech

"The ""Visiting every building on campus"" challenge.",78,28,"Greetings /r/gatech,

I'm a [bored](https://xkcd.com/267/) CS student, and I like to explore. I also want to meet new people outside my major. It seems a little sad that even though I've been here for a year already I've only really been to a few places on campus. While my life is centered around Klaus and CCB, I've never been in any of the bio quad buildings, for example!

Therefore, I decided to make it a challenge to visit every building on campus at least once before I graduate. But I also think it's not very interesting if I simply just go to a building and walk around aimlessly. So it would be better if I had someone who was familiar with the place to show me around and point out anything interesting or cool that people outside your major might not be aware of. It also seems like a fun way to learn and share what cool stuff we have on campus that not many people know about.

That's where you can help! If you're a different major, I would love to meet up sometime, hang out, and explore any of the places that you go every day. The places that are mundane to you are new and exciting to me! If I piqued your interest, please send me a PM. Or send it to your friends. Thanks for reading my post! :D

**List of places I'm already familiar with**:

* CCB
* CODA
* The Hive / IDC

**Cool-looking places I want to see:**

* [~~Nanotechnology building~~](https://cleanroom.gatech.edu/content/Capabilities) ~~(isn't there like a die fab here?!?!?!)~~ Visited!! And there *IS* really cool equipment!
* Petit building (What's with the clean room in the basement!!!)
* Caddell building (it looks cool from the outside. but I don't know what they do)
* Bio Quad: Petit biotech, Whitaker, Ford, Molecular Sci.&Eng. (these buildings look super fancy, I wonder what cool stuff is inside.)
* Krone (This building has really cool architecture and I keep seeing busy-looking grad students come out of here. But I don't know what it is they research)
* [Manufacturing quad](https://mill.mse.gatech.edu/): Love, Manufacturing research center, Manufacturing complex (there's an electron microscope!!!!)
* ~~Architecture (there's pretty art inside.)~~ Saw it!! And learned about their major.
* Scheller (looks really fancy)
* ~~Howey, Mason (maybe cool physics stuff here?)~~ Visited! Saw Jupiter and Saturn through the telescope for the first time in my life :)
* Skiles (I've been here, but surely a math major knows more than me.)
* Coon, Weber (Maybe cool space stuff here??)
* Guggenheim, Knight, and Eng Sci & Mech. (Maybe cool aerospace or ME stuff here?)
* Van Leer (Isn't there a huge radio tower on the roof?)

To all e-scooter riders: wear a fucking helmet.,104,21,"I just took a super nasty fall off of a Bird behind the MRDC. The slabs of concrete aren't level, and a bump I've hit a dozen times before sent me flying. Bird went one direction, I went another. My knees are scrapped the hell up, my left elbow is a bloody disaster, and my chin is a mess. As far as I can tell, nothing is broken, but there is some sharp occasional pain in my left arm and leg. Health Center patched me up and sent me on my way, telling me to come back in the morning if anything got worse.

And ya know what? It would have been a thousand times worse if I hadn't had my helmet on. There's a huge scrape across the front lip that would have been my forehead smacking dead into pavement at 15 miles an hour. At the absolute very least it would mean that my face would have gotten even more messed up, but it likely would have been a concussion or broken skull.

Literally on the way back to my dorm, I stopped a scooter rider who was heading downhill straight for an even worse bump that he apparently didn't notice. And guess what? He didn't have a helmet.

Please, please wear a helmet. I believe the health center told me that GTPD give them out to riders who want one. Yeah, they might look stupid, or they might be yet another thing to keep track of and deal with, but an accident without one can wreck your month, possibly more.",d57u0j,gatech

"How to Search - For new students and old: a guide to answering your own questions. Plus FAQs, guides, and other helpful links",216,18,"#Introduction

In this day and age, you literally have the world's knowledge at your fingertips. Knowing how to access it is a fundamental skill you need to have in order to be successful in your academic and professional careers.

It's perfectly fine to have questions and it's fine to ask them. You can try asking anonymous strangers on an internet forum like Reddit for help, but there's a good chance that many of your questions can be answered in minutes with a quick search. Here's how.


#Read the FAQs and guides first

Many students have already made FAQs and guides to help you. A lot of basic questions about registration, housing, food, campus, etc. are already answered in detail through these guides. 

**If you're new to Georgia Tech, you should read these:**

* [You have AP/IB credit, should you skip Calculus/Chem/Physics/Bio/etc.?](http://www.shoulditakethecredit.com/)

* [/u/willhwt's excellent in-depth guide to Georgia Tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8lp5wz/guide_to_georgia_tech/)

* [GT FAQ](http://www.shoulditakethecredit.com/faq/) (also found in the [sidebar, among other useful links](https://i.imgur.com/JMPmRZDr.png))

* [Google Doc guide posted on Facebook a few years ago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15oJCd7szl0Yg5jFct0o3S_FV7QnAXgjWwiCgEAvHT_A)

* [GT Protips Reddit thread, also found in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/2hhz26/gt_protips/)

* [FAQ thread on Reddit from 7 years ago, still contains useful advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/sfyyk/why_dont_we_have_a_faq_for_the_newly/)

* [2018 Incoming Student Megathread on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8zcq30/incoming_student_faset_questions_megathread/)

* [2017 Incoming Student Megathread on this sub, not as useful because it's in contest mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/6huzj4/incoming_student_questions_megathread/)

#Google

Chances are at least 90% of all the questions you'll ever have in your entire life can probably be found on Google. 

**Search queries don't need complete sentences**, in general, the fewer words the better. Adding ""**gatech**"" to queries will give you official GT websites, where you can find answers to questions like:

* How do I know what classes to take for my major? What's the lowest grade I can get to pass a class? = [gatech [major] requirements](https://www.google.com/search?q=gatech+cs+requirements)


* What housing options are there? When is move-in? How much does GT Housing cost? = [gatech housing](https://www.google.com/search?q=gatech+housing)


* When do classes start? What days do we get off? = [gatech academic calendar](https://www.google.com/search?q=gatech+academic+calendar)

* When is the financial aid deadline? What financial aid/scholarships are out there? = [gatech financial aid scholarships](https://www.google.com/search?q=gatech+financial+aid+scholarships)

#Advanced Google

[Search operators](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) will take your Google searches to the next level, and while you don't need to know all of them, there are a few that are especially useful for those looking to get answers on this sub:

* Use **site:reddit.com\/r/gatech** to limit your search results to posts and comments on /r/gatech. This also allows you to search for specific comments on megathreads that are indexed by Google. Most questions you might have can be answered if you Google them with this operator

* Use **[word or phrase 1] AROUND(x) [word or phrase 2]** to search for words or phrases within X words of each other. **This is extremely useful for scheduling questions**, but might require tweaking based on the classes you're looking up

* Use quotation marks around strings **""[specific string]""** to search for exactly that specific string. This is helpful if Google keeps searching for synonyms for a word or you're trying to search a phrase, though less applicable to questions usually found on this sub.

For example, let's say you're trying to see if MATH 1551, CS 1331, PHYS 2211, and PSYC 1101 is a doable schedule: 

* Google: [math 1554 AROUND(4) cs 1331 AROUND(4) phys 2211 AROUND(4) psyc 1101 site:reddit.com/r/gatech](https://www.google.com/search?q=math+1554+AROUND(4\)+cs+1331+AROUND(4\)+phys+2211+AROUND(4\)+psyc+1101+site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fgatech)

#Search on Reddit

Reddit's search function, while limited, can be useful for more frequently asked questions about classes, professors, housing, etc.

[Here's where the search bar is in old reddit](https://i.imgur.com/xsvjvNx.png)

[Here's where the search bar is in the redesign](https://i.imgur.com/tlms8Zq.png)

Reddit search can get you quick answers to questions like:

* [What is the difference between Modern and Classical Physics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/search?q=phys+modern+classical&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)

* [What is the best dorm?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/search?q=best+dorm&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)

* [How bad is the ratio?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/search?q=ratio&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)

* [How is [professor]?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/search?q=jankowski&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)

...and many more. I always start with a quick Reddit search to see if the answer can be easily found there.

Vaping in your dorm room + smoke alarm ear rape,0,5,"Prepared for the downvotes on this one, but I'm curious how many others use electronic cigarettes in their dorms. I started smoking cigarettes at 10 years old and it was only when I bought my first vape that I was able to successfully quit tobacco for good (2 or 3 years ago). Between my nicotine dependency and unrelenting anxiety, I see no alternative to vaping in my room since I spend 80-90% of my time awake sitting at my desk. Roommates don't mind it, but I have accidentally triggered my smoke alarm before (shuts off after about 10 seconds of screeching) and just did so again yesterday. Has this happened to anyone else?

A bit peeved about housing,30,10,"So I was supposed to move into Woodruff South today, but they're doing maintenance on the AC. I appreciate them moving us somewhere with AC (Nelson Shell) , but what I didn't appreciate was the attitude I got when I asked if it was possible if I could get the key to the room I'm going to move into in a week anyway so that I could move most of my belongings there since I would only have the help of my one friend for today only since he is going back home (we're OOS). The rest of my friends are back at home, I have no family down here, and I wasn't technically supposed to be moving my stuff anyway since I just got diagnosed with mono, so now I'm just in this pickle where I'm too small and weak to carry my stuff over and up to the third floor of another dorm next week all because they couldn't let me just take the damn key, have my friend and I move what I didn't need for the week into the room, and hell, even return the key and pick it up the following week if it was that big of a problem and I would just live with what I needed in Nelson Shell this week. I was technically supposed to get the room today anyway. Now I can't unpack anything or really get comfortable since I'll just have to up and move again anyway. Guess it beats the sweltering heat, which I'm sure isn't great for my health, but geez. Talk about inconvenient.

Air conditioner PSA,20,1,"The air conditioners in some of Georgia Tech's dorms are central, meaning that cold water is piped from a main unit into the individual units.

\- I've been trying, but less successfully, to make a few friends/friendly acquaintances in my dorm.

Possibly getting in trouble for play fighting,2,8,"So about 2 weeks ago me and my roommate were play fighting and it escalated a bit to like 2 real punches before it got broken up by our friends and we were being pretty noisy so our RA came in and asked what was going on and I had a bloody nose and so he said he had to write it up. Fast forward to this week I met with the hall director of the dorm and basically I told him what happened, I admitted to throwing the first punch but said it was on accident but he said they have to report it because we technically got injured and it's considered endangering behavior. Basically, he told me a few things could happen, they could go easy on me and say it was just play fighting since we're actually friends and it really was, or they could say it was still dangerous and punish me (since I technically started it) with like a reflection paper or something, or they could put me on probation next semester. Apprently some new policy that just got implemented this semester says that like serious fighting is grounds for immediate probation. So I could possibly get fucked here very hard for something so dumb.

Today I received an email saying

 ""At this stage of my investigation, there
exists enough information to charge in this case. Charging does not, however, assume that you
are responsible for violating any sections of the code; it only causes the second half of our
process to open up.""

So they gave me three choices, I can accept responsibility for breaking the code of conduct, deny responsibility and have an administrative hearing with a hearing officer, or have a hearing with the university conduct board.  I'm just wondering what I should do to receive the minimum punishment?

Nobody really got hurt and it was just typical roughhousing that guys get into but now it might become an unnecessary problem should I get the worst punishment, and I will more than likely be receiving the most punishment since I technically started it while my friend gets off scot-free which is kinda bullshit. I was willing to take the fall at first cuz I didn't think anything bad happened but it was a mutual thing and now it looks like I will get the more severe punishment

To all incoming freshman: please know how to NOT set off the fire alarm in dorms,148,32,"I'm long since out of dorms, but i'll tell ya NOTHING is worse than being dead asleep after a night of hard work and being violently woken up by the fire alarm, and having to march outside in the freezing cold in pajama pants and just stand there for what feels like an hour while they search the building, only to find out later that some shitheel set microwave popcorn on for too long or something.

Here's how you WON'T cause this scenario:

* Put water in the easy mac BEFORE it goes in the microwave
* Popcorn is done when the popping slows down significantly, not when it stops completely. If it stopped completely, you went too long. Take it out before that.

Feel free to add to this admittedly short list in the comments.

Edit: the true LPTs are in the comments:

* Stay in the room with the microwave the whole time, so you'll be able to respond right away if something starts smoking (u/Mathern\_)
* Just because something says it's ""microwave safe"" doesn't mean it's... actually totally safe. Take any food bought in a metal container and transfer it to an actual microwave-safe dish before heating it up. (u/firestar431)
* For the love of god, take your fucking vapes OUTSIDE. For every story I've heard of someone smoking actual cigarettes in an inappropriate place, I've heard 20 about someone vaping in an inappropriate place, (u/shoshy566)

2)I'd like to make a nap hole under my bed. Do the beds rise high enough for someone to sit under or would u need risers?

3) Do any of the residence halls/non-suite housing have access to a full kitchen or only the kitchenettes? and do people use them regularly or are they kinda just there. I used to have this idea that on one of the days in the first week before classes start, id bake cookies and leave them out in the lounge or wherever with a little note to stop by my dorm and say hi.

We have a second retail bus and some Winter Break schedules now~,8,6,"Thought I saw this in an SG FPAT meeting minutes document somewhere, but yeah, [we've got a second retail bus](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Weekend%20Retail%202.pdf) that runs 45 minutes behind the regular Retail. That should be pretty cool; I don't ride that route much anymore, but I'm sure people will be pleased with not waiting for the bus to come back to Marketplace in 90 minutes. It's something?

Besides that, [the winter break schedules are up](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/transportation/bus)! It's a bit of a mess to read with all those links, so here's my attempt to clear it up:

Keep in mind these:

- If you live in Rustic, Crittenden, or transfer to the RTS, skip the rest of this, the Off Campus [1](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/RIT%20Off%20Campus%20Express%201.pdf) and [2](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/RIT%20Off%20Campus%20Express%202.pdf) operates all weekdays that the school is open (so not December 25th - January 1st) with the normal hours.

- All weekend service operates normally on weekends the school is open (so not December 28th and 29th) with the normal hours. Note that the [Retail](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Weekend%20Retail%20Fall%2019-20.pdf) operates with only one vehicle, the [Inn](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Weekend%20RIT%20Inn.pdf) ends at 1:30 AM and the [Weekend East Side](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Weekend%20Evening%20Campus%20Shuttle.pdf) ends at 2 AM Sunday nights/Monday mornings because the TE3 does not operate during break. On the first weekend (December 21st-22nd), the [Early Morning Shuttle](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Weekend%20Early%20Morning%20Shuttle.pdf) and Weekend East Side are replaced with the [all-day East Side](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/Winter%20Break%20East%20Side.pdf) from the weekdays, see below.

With the above in mind:

- On weekdays from December 19th (Thursday, the day after finals) to the 23rd (Monday, the day before Christmas Eve), the regular weekday [RIT Inn](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/RIT%20Inn%2019-20.pdf), Off-Campus Express 1 & 2, and an all-day East Side (7 AM - 1:30 AM) run. 
Weekend service is normal, except the East Side runs in place of the Early Morning and Evening East Side routes.

- On December 24th, the services from the previous weekdays end early (Off Campus [1](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/12-24-19%20RIT%20Off%20Campus%20Express%201.pdf) and [2](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/12-24-19%20RIT%20Off%20Campus%20Express%202.pdf) at 6:30, [East Side](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/East%20Side%2012-24-19.pdf) at 7 PM, [Inn](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/RIT%20Inn%2012-24-19.pdf) at 7:15) for Christmas Eve.

- No service from the 25th to the 1st, the University is closed.

- On weekdays from January 2nd (Thursday, first day the school reopens) to the 8th (the next Wedneday), the [Intersession bus](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/sites/rit.edu.fa.parking/files/pats/transportation/shuttle-schedules/2019-20/intersession%20Jan%202%20-%2015.pdf); a merge of the Inn and East Side routes operates, replacing those two routes. The Off Campus 1 & 2 continue like normal. On weekends, the normal routes from the academic year run.

- On January 9th (Thursday before classes, and the dorms reopen) and 10th (Friday before classes), the Intersession splits back into the all-day East Side and Inn (Weekday). The Off Campus 1 & 2 continue like normal.

- Normal service starts Saturday, January 11th into the Spring Semester! Maybe they'll keep that second Retail around...

There's also two extra routes going around:

- The SG's Break Bus goes from Gleason Circle to the Airport, Greyhound/Trailways, and Amtrak stations from 8 AM to 2 PM on December 19th (Thursday, when dorms close), and from 10 AM to 4 PM on January 12th (the Sunday before classes). [Here's the CampusGroups link](https://campusgroups.rit.edu/RITSG/rsvp_boot?id=630384).

- A charter operates from the Res Halls to the Inn to carry those relocated to the Inn for break from 8 AM - 10 AM on December 19th (when the dorms close) and January 9th (when the dorms reopen).",e56jsf,rit

3 years in dorms is one too many,102,87,"The NTID scholarship office claims that the 3 year dorm requirement is ""giving D/deaf and hard-of-hearing students the opportunity to be good role models for the deaf community in the dorms"" and that ""no one's being forced to stay in the dorms"".

What a joke.

There was a Pawprints petition last year which waived the dorm living requirement for third years- but only for that year. Another one was started last fall, hoping to achieve a similar effect. We were told that we would, again, not be required to live in dorms as third years. Fantastic news, except we were lied to. The scholarship office/NTID administration then backpedaled and stated that if there was enough interest shown in waiving the requirement, it may happen again this year. The administration had several students meet with them, and- surprise!- they all expressed that they wanted the scholarship to go back to two years, as it had been in the past. They then claimed that their schedules were busy and they couldn't meet with any more students. Since then, radio silence. Apparently they're just using this year as an evaluation period to see how many students actually stay in dorms to keep the scholarship. Of course, none of this was publicly announced.

Living in the dorms as a freshman can be pretty fun. You're with people your age, floor events are still fun, and it's a great transition from living at home to being on your own for the first time. As a second year, however, it's not the same. You have no real need to go to floor events- why hang out with freshmen you don't know when you could hang out with your actual friends? Community engagement is clearly lacking. Fire alarms are even more irritating. Campus food takes more of a toll on your body. Living with a roommate in close quarters (especially with unlofted beds) becomes even more tedious.That being said, being a second-year dorm student, while not exactly optimal, is a pretty fair price to pay in exchange for discounted tuition. After two years, though, it  gets crazy. Classes ramp up. Co-ops start coming in in full swing. A large portion of the NTID-supported community decides to forgo the scholarship or go on co-op at this point, leaving the community of upperclassmen essentially gone. Living in the dorms with people two years younger than you while your friends all have their own kitchens and can legally drink at their apartments isn't fun.

Sure, they're not technically forcing anyone to stay, but moving out of dorms means you lose $1500-3000/semester in scholarships. And really, if it was about being a good role model, wouldn't the Honors college be forced to stay in dorms? What about RIT Presidential Scholars? It's all about the money.

It's not that living in dorms is absolutely the worst. It definitely has its perks, and this is an incredible school. Yet the fact remains that I'm sick of eating on-campus every day. I don't want to keep living in a tiny little bedroom with another person in it. I'm fed up of being deprived of housing that better suits my emotional and physical health needs.

I know that this may come off as biased or ungrateful, or an attack on the NTID administration. I do not want it to come off this way- again, RIT anad NTID provide the opportunity of a lifetime for so many students, including myself. Some people love dorms, and they are admittedly better than those at some other schools I have visited. This issue is something that apparently needs to be projected to the RIT community at large if any change is to be made, as 500+ signatures on Pawprints seem to mean nothing. 

Please voice whatever opinions you have in the comments.

tl;dr being forced to live in dorms as a third year to be a ""good role model"" is kinda terrible

**edit** I forgot to mention that when I originally met with someone to address my concerns they also said that ""Well you can always go to the RIT Inn!"". The Inn shouldn't be an option in the first place, let alone a reasonable alternative to anything.

**edit 2** To stay in dorms or the Inn you're also required to buy a full meal plan, which costs over $2500 a semester. This brings the total cost of living in dorms to upwards of $6.5k a semester.",85oqlx,rit

Question about Roommates bringing rude guests over without consent,24,12,"I'm asking for my relatively friend in this context:

My friend lives in dorms, and has a single roommate who repetitively invites 3-6 guests over that are very rude, doing actions that include eating his food, sitting on his bed, playing loud music while he studying, including after he has told them to quiet it down, and outright calling him a ""bitch"" or ""pussy"" when he tells them to not. His roommate doesn't seem to be apart of these actions, but seems to either not care, or encourage it.

Computer Science: RIT vs UB,3,12,"These two schools are currently my top 2 for CS as of right now however I’m struggling to figure out which one would be best for me.

The biggest differentiator between the two is the tuition. What makes a degree from RIT worth $100-150 grand (id have to dorm whereas at UB I could live at home) more than a degree from UB?

Personally I really would like to go to RIT just to get away and experience life away from home (albeit not super far), and I’m not SUPER hell-bent on going to a big-city/social school (would still be nice) but the tuition costs are so severely different it seems tough trying to realistically figure out how RIT is worth the difference.",dn2u61,rit

"To Prospective Students,",0,17,"I wanted to make this post for anyone considering attending RIT. Yes, I am aware that this is subjective, and for some, RIT may be the school for them. There is, however, a multitude of problems when it comes to RIT. I'm a third year, and I have to say, just give it some time, and you'll see just how much RIT views their students as profit margins as opposed to students.

&#x200B;

The biggest offender here is housing. In regards to dorms? Yeah, RIT has no problem charging someone who lives in Fish the same amount as someone who lives in Ellingson; totally fair given the lack of lobby, elevator, AC, laundry room, hell even VENDING machines in Fish. Tuition is being raised and all this extra money is coming in... Yet there is still somehow not enough housing for each student. This, paired with the fact that there is also barely enough parking for commuters literally baffles me. After doing a bit of research for five minutes, I can see that this has been a problem for at least five years now... Administration is somehow content just not doing anything about it. If you can somehow avoid giving RIT your money to live on campus, I would.

&#x200B;

Another big problem imo about RIT is that the school loves looking presentable to parents/alumni, but does not care about the experiences of the students that live here. It seems worth talking about the fact that the quarter mile was dangerous to walk down for the past two months, yet they miraculously had all the lights installed for homecoming. A good deal of what you see and hear from the school itself is a front that will slowly unravel itself as you study here.  Take anything the school feeds you with a grain of salt; just because RIT tells you they have alumni working at Google does not mean that every student is going to get a job with a big tech company. This also raises another thought of mine, that RIT on top of being money hungry towards literal teenagers, is grooming you to give money back to them when you graduate. I know that most schools do this, but it seems even more outright offensive when you consider that RIT puts on this polished front when the alumni come around, but refuses to consider the state of the school when they are not.

&#x200B;

Don't even get me started on diversity/community here. Yeah, there are more... niche communities here, but good luck finding a good sense of community if you're a woman of color or LGBT. In the entirety of my major (200+ students), there is one black woman. On top of this, RIT has a prominent lack of mental health support/assistance to LGBT folk; dealt with a homophobic roommate the entirety of last year and housing did zero to help with that. To pair with this, good luck finding people that stray from the cookie cutter norms that RIT has in the first place; for some, this place can feel just like high school.

&#x200B;

The quality of class content can be rather subpar as well. RIT loooves touting the fact that we are the next best thing you'll get to an ivy-league. This is somehow their justification for raising the tuition. Yet, there are still some classes that are pretty much taught exclusively through YouTube videos and a professor's blind reading of PowerPoint slides. Expect a few of your classes to pretty much be glorified online classes.

&#x200B;

All of this being said, you will definitely network through RIT. There is an extensive alumni network, and the co-op process will definitely differentiate you from other graduates. However, the trade-off for the time you spend here and the way that RIT treats you is definitely worth considering.

&#x200B;

TL;DR RIT will probably get you a job in the field you are studying, but make no mistake: they see you as a bag of money more than a student. If you have the GPA for it, and are going into debt... Might as well just take it at an ivy-league.",dlrli8,rit

Looks like we might be getting out of dorms after all! But we need help.,34,18,"I posted a while back about my thoughts on the 3rd-year-dorm requirement. Against all odds, it seems that the winds of change are blowing.

The Pawprint petition started earlier in the year got a [response](https://pawprints.rit.edu/?p=457)! I've posted the text below, but **tl;dr** pending administrative approval, NTID-supported third years can move into on-campus housing b/c they surveyed students and figured out that dorms are terrible.

It's not a perfect solution, but on-campus housing is still better than dorms.

So, if you're an NTID-supported student, *please* fill out the housing survey in the Pawprints response and make your voice heard! This is important for our community's wellbeing and we need a team effort to get us out of three years of dorm-hell.

""Hello,

Student Government has been working to get this changed, and we wanted to ensure that an update was communicated to students. We have had continuous conversations with Mary Karol (NTID Assistant VP for Student and Academic affairs) and Bernie Hurwitz (Assistant VP for NTID Administration) to reach a desired outcome that works for the student body. Earlier this year, we sent out a survey to gather information about the trial run that was established last fall. The survey reported that most students had a positive experience living outside of the dorms. However, the survey showed noticed that all students that lived off campus in their third year encountered major challenges surrounding transportation, time management, budgeting and staying involved with student activities. The reasoning behind the dorm restrictions within the NTID scholarships is that it ensures the wellbeing of students as well as active participation in student life. It was found that students were not happy with the social restrictions of living in the dorms. All students living in on-campus apartments reported growing experiences and continued involvement, showing that changes are needed. A consensus was reached that third year recipients of the NTID scholarships should be able to live at any RIT housing on campus. We also recognize the financial burden associated with living out of dorms. For this reason, Student Government will work with the NTID administration to organize financial consultations for students looking to move out of dorms. 

No final action has been made as Mary Karol commented that it must be brought before higher administration for final action. Changes do look promising for 2017-2018 scholarship recipients, but we still need more survey respondents to push for final change since we only had 18% of students respond. You can fill out the survey here and report your living experiences! If you have any further questions, Mary Karol encourages students to email her at mkmnca@ntid.rit.edu. 

Thank you,
Bobby Moakley
Student Government President-Elect

RIT Honors Program- A Detailed Attack,12,10,"Hello everyone! I’m going into my third year at RIT this year as an engineer. In an effort to shroud who I am as much as possible, I’ve made a new Reddit account with a burner email and am not giving away my full name or major. I’m here today to talk to current and incoming RIT honors students to explain why, after all I’ve seen and researched, this is the saddest excuse for an “honors” program, and should never be joined under any circumstances.

To begin, I’d like to list my complaints with the program before I get into the few positives it does bring.

1. You get no money. Despite the honors program containing the students that make RIT look as prestigious as it does, there is no scholarship incentive to join. What they do have is a measly $500 travel grant if you go abroad. Congratulations! For busting your ass in this program for your entire college career you can buy at most one full one way plane ticket. Have fun being stuck in Europe with your college debt.

2. You have guaranteed housing… in one of the worst dorm halls on campus. I’d argue only Sol is worse from my research. There’s only one full sized lounge left in the building because whoever was in charge decided to turn all the other spaces into quads, and as if that wasn’t bad enough they patronizingly call it the “Honors Lounge”. Yeah, okay. Go to Gleason or any other hall for something more upscale than this. Plus, there’s no air conditioning, the elevator is constantly broken, and it’s one of the oldest halls on campus, making it flat out gross. 

3. Forced service hours. Twenty hours of service isn’t bad. That’s not what I’m saying. The fact that it is required to stay in the program is ridiculous considering you reap no benefits. Call me a selfish conspiracy theorist, but I believe the program is set up in this way because honors staff knows there’s no way honors kids would do service with their already busy schedules.

4. The feeling that we’re being sidelined. Oh boy. Where do I begin? Munson took away the honors orientation experience this year. This was bar none the best aspect of the program. When I did it, I was able to come a week early, go on trips, and experience campus before the crowd rolled in. It’s wonderful! We’ve also gotten shoved into a laughably small office in Global Village, as if they weren’t already trying to force us out. Clearly, this program is not viewed as important. Not that I blame them.

5. HONORS CREDIT HOURS. This one speaks for itself. Why have I done these? Why SHOULD I do these? Yeah, I’ll take my 21 credit semester and make one class harder for no good reason. What benefit do I get?

6. Employers flat out don’t care. There’s no true check employers make to even see if you’re in the program. It’s like when you were graduating high school and put on your college app that you were in an Honor’s society. Want the credit for being in the program? Just lie. Easy. 

With those 6 major complaints and a laundry list more (the patronizing existence of “pizza Fridays” as one of the only true benefits to being in the program, the laughable honors council, the lackluster committees) I hope my point has been made clear. To avoid as much pushback as possible I’d like to speak for a moment about the positives.

I know everyone will be talking about early access to classes. Yes, this is a major plus. But wait… most honors students took AP classes in high school, right? This would mean, like myself, a majority of would be honors students are already a semester ahead in classes and get priority pick anyway. Think about it. When compared to the rest of your year, does the one extra day give you that much of a boon? Classes you would want are going to be swallowed up by upperclassmen anyway. I don’t want to pick this point apart too much, because there is a small argument to be made. Let it be known this is the only plus I could find with the entire program.

TL;DR The Honors program is the worst designed and implemented beast I’ve seen in my few years at RIT. Do not join. There is no benefit. Get out while you can. Don’t buy in to their rhetoric.",csnao1,rit

"Incoming Students of 2019, Welcome!",77,55,"Hello, incoming Tigers!

I am becoming increasingly excited for the school year to start as we become ever nearer to each of the move-in dates, and I am sure that you are all excited too. But, with all the excitement there are bound to be all kinds of questions, fears, etc. With that in mind, I thought it might be useful to some of you on this sub if there was a thread where myself and our other more experienced students could provide answers to all of your burning questions.

I assure you that there is no such thing as a dumb question or one that is too small to ask. I remember my biggest concerns were ""How early is too early to show up for classes?"" and ""How in the world does using my ID to buy things work?""

For each of my comments responding to questions, I will do my best to provide a source for my answers. Things have changed in major ways since many of the older students in this sub have started, and I want to ensure that you can get correct information.

As a little background on myself, I am a rising 4th year BS/MS in Computing Security originally from Ohio. On-campus, I have worked as a student lab instructor in the Computer Science Department for three semesters, and have served as an Honors Mentor (orientation leader for honors groups) since 2017.

&#x200B;

Before I end this rather long post, I just want to add in some quick advice that I think might be helpful.

1. If you are in dorms, keep your door open! This helps you to meet new people and to be a little more social
2. If you are comfortable with it, ask the people around you to join you for a meal, games, etc. The first week can be scary, it's a lot easier to be with friends.
3. If you are asked to join someone for a meal or games or whatever else, give joining them serious consideration.
4. Take advantage of your resources! There are so many ways to get help with whatever you are going through regardless of it is a medical, academic, financial, or anything else. Take advantage of the resources at your disposal and it is often bound to make the experience far less horrible. 

So, feel free to ask any questions you have about RIT or college in general, and I will do my best to answer each and every one of them. If you would prefer not to ask something in a public setting, feel free to shoot me a DM and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Best of luck as we start the 2019 academic year, and a big welcome to each of you to the Tiger Family!",cli8sc,rit

Personal Router in UofT Dorm Room?,8,14,"Recently Grad House switched over from each room only having an ethernet port and allowing you to buy your own WiFi router, to now setting up UofT WiFi throughout the building. At first I was annoyed that I had to buy a router, but now I've enjoyed having my own WiFi network for streaming to my Home Mini, which cannot connect at all on UofT WiFi (b/c of WPA-enterprise security). Also, connecting to the UofT wifi requires fixing my laptop DNS settings *every* time, not sure why, and I have a wired Raspberry Pi server I want to access locally. But, Grad House keeps sending out emails demanding residents disable personal routers to reduce interference with the official UofT wifi. Hardwiring your laptop is still allowed.

1. **How do they detect a hardwired laptop vs a router?** By the MAC? Can the NAT be detected?
2. **How can I get around this?** I was thinking about converting my router to DD-WRT and setting it up as a wireless repeater. UofT WPA Enterprise WiFi goes in, personal WPA Personal WiFI goes out. But, performance would be terrible and not sure my router is easily flash-able.

Would people, especially girls, think I am creepy now, especially since I am a guy?  How should I face them ever again in this class since so many people may have seen it, for the rest of the class I did not look around because I was so embarrassed. No one said anything but I don't want people to think I am creepy or anything or stalk people's IG.

"For Those of you who are struggling rn, know that you are not alone",23,5,"most of you have probably learned about the tragic event in Bahen and I am really strucked by it. I really really want to help but I don't know how to. perhaps I'm just stupid but I am thinking that maybe sharing my experience of how I made it through the hard times might be helpful.

Like what everyone was saying,  life may be hard right now but don't you give up just yet because it will only get better. 

To give you a little background I'm a third year international student studying cs. As an international student, stepping into a whole new and stressful environment all alone is most definitely very stressful, and me being extremely shy didn't help at all. My first two years was spend in my little dorm with little to no interaction with others. I had no friends and didn't bother making any, cause afterall who would want to befriend a lonely fatass. and so, I hid in my corner and only went out for classes and food. To me, that was my darkest periods of time. At that time I felt like I was all alone with no one beside me and no one cared if I'm gone or not.  and so if you think you are alone to face all these struggles,  believe me, you are not. I never had the guts to go to a psychiatrist or to seek out help because I was scared of what others may think of me. On top of that, the pressure to achieve a good grade from my family surely didn't help with my already depressed life.  Well, that was me not long ago,  but it all started to change when I start going to the gym and joint a club.  I'm not saying I'm all of a sudden cured of depression but I think life is definitely getting better.  in my club,  I was beginning to make some friends,  though far from close friends but I am making progress so yey for me I guess.  On top of that,  I felt going to the gym also helped boost my confidence although it may be hard to stick to it at the start. 

What I mean to say is that for those of you struggling right now,  know that you are no alone in fighting this tough battle,  there are others who are going through the same conflict. It will get better and you just need to hold on a little longer. You are not alone we are all here for you if you are willing to reach out. 

Also all the hotlines and consultation resources  are super useful but for those who are too shy to reach out like me,  I really recommend going to the gym where you can do your own thing without interacting with others. that really helped me and I sincerely believe it will help you too.  

thank you for taking the time to go through my impulsive writing and I apologize if my english was awkward.  I just hope maybe some of you could relate to it and to know there is more to life than the simple grade you get from an assignment or quiz.  Don't let that simple number defeat you.

 I sincerely, with all my heart, hope you could stay strong and to not give up just yet. You are going to make it through and if you want to chat my inbox is always open.",dacdm1,UofT

UofT vs. McGill,12,26,"Hello everyone! I know this question gets asked a lot in here and at Mcgill's, but hear me out. I got accepted into UofT for an art major and I also got accepted into McGill but for a major that I ended up not being really in love with, so I have to make a decision between the two.

In my opinion, both seem like pretty good schools but there are certain factors that are making me reconsider my decisions, so I am gonna put them in below:

&#x200B;

**McGill University**

Pros

1. **Everything is more affordable**
   1. Tuition in McGill, in my case, is three times cheaper than in UofT for the same major
      1. If the education is pretty much the same or better at McGill, then I consider that price a bargain in comparison to UofT. You are basically paying for the same or better prestige, education, and school for a bit less than 1/4 of UofT price.
      2. The highest price you can get for tuition at McGill is around $45k.
   2. Residence is way cheaper and more spacious than at UofT. I did not apply for residence, but I found out that the dorms more spacious and 4k - 10k lower than UofT. This makes UofT residences seem like a joke. If I could go back again, I would have checked the box for interest in housing option.
   3. Housing off-campus is also very cheap. I read someone say that they paid $700/month for a place in Montreal.
2. McGill is very known for being **culturally diverse** and having a very heterogenous international population, which to me seems a really good opportunity to meet people from around the world.
3. Montreal is considered to be a **laid-back, artsy, and European style city.** It is not as fast-paced as the city of Toronto, so I think I will feel less pressure living there.
4. **Admission is more selective**, therefore the alumni must be consisting of academically successful individuals who are intellectual and ambitious at the same time.
5. Montreal is well known for the **social scene and night life** (though not important to me).

Cons

1. McGill is placed at a **lower position than UofT in terms of prestige** (based of top lists). It is the top 2nd in Canada and top 33rd in the world.
2. It is apparently more difficult to find a job if you do not **speak French**.
3. I chose a major that I ended up not liking at McGill. I see that I have the option of transferring from one faculty to the other, but the problem is that I have to **wait until the end of my first year to actually apply for transfer**. I am afraid that I am going to waste a year studying something I do not enjoy and may repeat my first year on my second year due to lack of credits. If I am wrong with this information, please correct me.
4. A lot of **people smoking everywhere**. I am not a fan of it.
5. Some people claim that Montreal can be racist or discriminating, especially to non-French speakers or non-caucasians.
6. Less options. There might be less options for study (I think by that people mean elective courses or learning opportunities) due to lower fundings compared to UofT.

**University of Toronto**

Pros

1. **University of Toronto is placed at the top in terms of prestige**. It is 1st in Canada and 28th in the world. Going there leaves a good impression on people.
2. The city of Toronto is considered to be very **modern and industrious**. Also, it is also called a great city outside of Canada. There are many things to do and many places to go to.
3. **People who are only anglophone are more likely to find jobs in here than in Montreal**.
4. Most big, industrious companies are based here. If I am looking for a a very nice position or a good job during school or after graduation, I seems that I can find it very easily in here.

Cons

1. **Everything is too expensive**
   1. I am expected to pay almost $60k on my first year for tuition alone. Hypothetically speaking, if that was the cost for every year for 4 years, then I would have to pay $240k for my whole college career.
   2. Residence is overpriced and way less spacious than in McGill (Trinity College Residence).
   3. I searched for off-campus housing, and the the lowest price you can get is between $800-$900. Apartments that are leased $700/month are very sketchy and too good to be true.
   4. Living expenses are higher than in Montreal.
2. It seems like University of Toronto is n**ot as culturally and internationally diverse as McGill**. Most international students come from Asia, or most of the non-caucasian Canadians are Asian-Canadians. Nothing against them (I am Asian myself), simply that I like to have friends and learn about the culture from more than a single group of people.
3. The city of Toronto can be quite **overwhelming and so more stressful** to live in due to the fast-paced environment.
4. It has been mentioned pretty much everywhere, so it is undeniable: i**t is easier to get into UofT than graduating from it**. I have seen that they accept people with marks as low as 85% and tend to give extremely challenging classes to students from 2nd year and up (a pretty good business strategy though).
5. From what I have seen in reddit, people seem **more stressed at UofT**. Some even regret going there to study. Some claim that they  work and study all day long, so people do not usually party in here. I don't care much about partying because I usually don't go to parties, but I want some free time for myself and my hobbies. Also, this can be the case for any school.

&#x200B;

I am an international student and the major I am interested in is offered by the faculty of arts(for both schools). The main factors in making my decision are **affordability, quality of education, and how my future can be affected by where I go for college**. In terms of price, McGill has greater advantage over UofT. In terms of quality of education, which one do you think teaches me more and better? Which one has a better arts faculty? Finally, which one is more recognised outside of Canada? Is there any preference for any school when applying to jobs in Canada?

I am also planning to apply for jobs starting my second year to pay my living expenses on my own. If I go to McGill, would there be any chance for me to find a job? I have work experience and I am multilingual, but I simply do not know French.

I am not planning on taking a masters, at least not right after graduation. I am considering going into law, but I am still deciding. For now, I want to land into a good job and explore as many options as possible after graduation.

Are the UC residences good or should I try finding roommates and rent somewhere else instead?,3,8,"I received the good news last week, I've been accepted to UofT with membership in University College!!

However, I feel like 15k for 8 months is a little overpriced considering that I wouldn't even have my own bathroom, and I'm a bit concerned about the meal plan since I am vegan. Is it really worth it to apply for residences or would I be better off renting a room somewhere else or finding roommates to share an apartment with? I'm trying to save a bit of money here, I'm not from Toronto and the most I've paid for rent is 550$ so I was a little bit shocked when I saw how expensive it was to live in the dorms.

How do you make friends here?,29,19,"I find it hard for me to make friends here, many reasons involved. So I’m just wondering, is it normally harder to make friends in uni here or is it something else? How do you manage to make friends here?
Reasons why I feel it’s difficult to make friends here:
1. I’m doing my 2nd Bachelor’s here and got accepted as a transfer student. Which means I’m 1-4 yrs older than 99.9% of my classmates, I’m not interested in lots of stuffs they are interested in any more(age gap), neither are our focuses in life. And since I’m a transfer student, even tho it is my first year here, I didn’t have any orientation and was too old for on campus residence, I feel like I’m missing out a lot on opportunities to get to know people. 
2. I’m very introverted and shy, so I don’t rly talk much with people I don’t know well, and I don’t rly start conversations either. It’s hard for me, even thinking about it makes me feel anxious. 
3. I’m a Chinese international student, and I feel like other students usually prefer talking with non Chinese students, probably because Chinese students usually only talk with and make friends among themselves. I would rly like to make some friends here, not just other Chinese students. Even with Chinese students, it’s hard because they are so rich(I bet I’m the poorest lmao), and I feel like somehow they already know each other before uni. 
4. People all have different schedules and programs, even if I get to know one or two in my class, after the class ends, we go separate ways and probably won’t ever see each other again after course ends. It’s very different from universities in China, where we all have same schedules, and live in dorms with same people for four years. Plus you can’t rly talk during lectures. 
5. Cultural differences.

3. Lastly, is there any sort of Facebook group or network for exchange students this summer?

A letter to UofT students suffering from heartbreak,98,34,"Hello everyone,

How's Midterm season going for all of you?

I bet you must have stumbled upon this post while taking a study break, or perhaps chilling in Starbucks nearby, maybe you're looking to procrastinate cleaning your dorm room and further procrastinating that by reading reddit, or maybe you're just walking to class. Whatever it is, I hope this post finds you well. As you may be guessing, OP must have a lot of time in their hands.

&#x200B;

What in the world happened in OP's life that caused them to write this whole long rant nobody cares about? UH.

&#x200B;

To be completely honest, I have been overly mind-fucked over instances that I have experienced in this University in the past 2 months since University has began, and I thought I need to vent out these thoughts to absolute strangers who step on the concrete of this University every day just like I do, whether we have crossed paths or not. While trying to study for my midterm this week, I realized something is distracting me every time, and I can't pretend to not have it bother me, so I felt the need to clear my mind before going back to study in exactly 15 minutes of this break I'm taking, so I hope you can all pardon my horrible grammar, spelling and syntax errors I have rushed here.

&#x200B;

Also, feel free to vent out whatever is distracting you in this post too, its understandable since it's midterm season and somehow your life just turns more dramatic at the time you need it to stay most calm, you'll be surprised to know you're not alone in a lot of things. Writing this paragraph in the last 3 minutes has already helped me, and I haven't even started.

&#x200B;

The student body in this University is amazing, people from all around the world with different cultures makes it all the more interesting and intriguing and I love that about being in the heart of Toronto. But here's the thing: falling for someone who comes from a different continent/culture to this University altogether is a struggle, and inevitable to come across.

(Aye, I bet a bunch of you are now starting to guess who wrote this rant, and if this post is centralized around you, and maybe, just maybe, it is. But otherwise, maybe it's John from residence who recently broke up with first-year Cathy who's an immigrant. Maybe it's a Zeta frat boy who fell for a sorority pledge, who's an international student. Maybe it's literally your roommate writing about you. You never know.)

&#x200B;

So far, I've met the following kinds of people in this University that I'm categorizing just for making it easier to reference later on (doesn't mean these are all there are and doesn't define nobody, don't take it too seriously):

1. People who are lonely, and just want a relationship (will jump to being in a relationship with whoever is kind to them, whether they 100% like them or no).
2. Anti-social (or rather SHY) crowd looking for opportunities to step out of their bubble. (Can be categorized under 1). Most likely overuses tinder, but doesn't follow up with dates.
3. People who are overconfident and will never 'settle' for anything lesser than their standards (stay single for a very long time lol but don't have issues with that)
4. People who are social, love getting to know people but will only date once they've connected well with someone they meet and not just anyone, because they know what they are looking for. (Can be confused with 3 but do remember they love experimenting before going into the right one unlike 3 being stuck-up about even meeting people)
5. Anti-social crowd. Does not want to date, just want to study and avoid social contact and gtfo.
6. People who fall under the first 4 categories, and are currently hurting because of heartbreak.

Phew, what was the point of this? Well, the problem is its midterm season and I fall under category 6.

I've met some amazing people at this University. But I've also met some inconsiderate individuals, and some d-bags. I understand that University is the time for everybody to experiment, and its when most people transform from being little kiddos to adults ish (but that's subjective for everyone of course, some people are naturally mature and others are the counterpart).

The following paragraph might be relatable for some of you, but some others might be judging me, and the others alike, very hard (""Geez, people like this exist? Ew. Go study for your midterm omg"").

&#x200B;

The issue here is you get caught up in feelings when somebody is in their kid-phase, and you're sure about your feelings even then, but they do 'kiddy', 'immature', 'I'm in University, just experimenting!' things and break your heart, despite of you making your intentions very clear from the start. And fast-forward to a few months, they are now wiser but they have outgrown you. What could eventually make this a lot worse is that now they are wiser and looking for a relationship, but you're not in the picture because you walked into their lives at the wrong time...when they were still, (guess it?), unsure. And that's the paradox, the sad sad reality. Relatable?

&#x200B;

Well, now, let's add another variable to complicate things. They come from an entirely different country and culture, where 'dating' is something entirely different than its North American definition. They are category 4.

Maybe, you are shy but really into them, but unable to express it the right away immediately. They like you too, but maybe they are swept away from your lack of ability to express your feelings towards them. But you probably don't know that. Maybe they are the ones looking for a sign, which your shy personality just does not allow. Maybe you do want to, but you're scared of rejection. Maybe you're scared of being too clingy and having them run off. The reasons behind being unable to express yourself is endless.

&#x200B;

Eventually, you'll wait for the right opportunity to tell them, and when you finally do, they are dating someone else and it's too late ('A Crazy little thing called love's climax just came to my mind). They connect with somebody else better, and for all the denial in the world it will take you, you need to accept the fact that it is simply not you. You can come up with 10000 what ifs of the past, what you could've done better and what you did wrong to not have them consider you, but you need to forgive yourself for not knowing any better. They are not coming back, because they were never completely there in the first place.

The person you liked chose someone else, and even though the argument remains ""I asked you out and you said you weren't looking for a relationship and now you're dating someone else"", you need to remember that they knew this, and chose to look beyond it at someone else instead of you. They were inconsiderate towards your feelings, they were, but they didn't owe it to you to make sure you weren't hurt.

&#x200B;

You will have to see them often around campus, or maybe not at all. You will have to see them online on your social media apps and fight the urge to not text them like you used to or ask them a million questions hoping for answers that would justify what they did to you. Maybe you'll have to restrain that awful nostalgia you'll get when you walk into restaurants you visited with them, and maybe you'll breakdown in the TTC sitting in through a stop you'll usually walk out of to meet with them before. You suddenly, feel a lot more strongly towards them now than you did before they broke your heart. And, well, you now have to go through Midterms with all this happening right in the middle.

&#x200B;

You might feel if you were honest about your feelings and how they made you feel from the very start, maybe things could've ended differently. Maybe they would've chosen you. The truth is, they wouldn't have, even then. You just weren't 'that person' to them, and you wouldn't ever be. Maybe you considered this person to be perfect for you. But you weren't for them, and this is literally the 'it's not you, it's them' situation. You were enough. You were more than enough. But a totally different kind of 'enough'.

&#x200B;

We have more than 50k students here (each in more than just 6 categories lol) and one day you'll be 'that person' for someone. You'll graduate, you'll be out of your comfort zone, you'll be motivated and you'll be just fine. This University has a lot of stories to tell and this one is just one of those many to be forgotten, maybe I'll forget about it too, but at least it got its own post at Reddit lol.

&#x200B;

Yours with great admiration,

Just one of the many hurting students.

"Incoming Master of Information student, and some questions",2,9,"Hey folks, I just paid the confirmation fee and I am now fully committed to iSchool’s Master of Information program. Very very excited to start this intellectual journey at U of T, but I have yet to visit the school or meet any faculty members. So here are some questions.

1. For anyone who had finished the program or who’s still in the program, how’s the course load? are the courses useful? how are the faculties? like, what’s the overall feel of the program? do you consider it a boost in your professional career or do you regret taking it? 

2. I did my undergrad in communications with specialization in advertising, and I’ve worked in the advertising field for about a bit more than a year now. I applied to this program’s Information Systems and Design concentration with no prior knowledge of coding, algorithm, or information systems. Am I expected to have certain level of knowledge coming in? or is everything taught in the program? What skills or online classes should I take in the next few months to equip myself for the program? I don’t want to get overwhelmed too quickly. 

3. I saw a post from 2 years ago saying that the size of classes are quite big for the typical grad-level courses, is that still the case? If so, how does faculty members take care of each individual student with such big class. It’s not like, psych 101, it’s a grad program we’re talking about here, and I’m sure I’ll have a lot of questions.

4. I saw on the admissions letter that all first-year students will have housing. I just want your opinion on this. Which dorms are the best? what are my chances of getting into them? or is it better to live off-campus? 

5. Excuse my ignorance, and sorry for anyone who’s taking offense to this. I’ve never been to Canada before and does everyone wear Canada Goose? I have a sturdy, fluffy goose down parka I’ve been wearing for about 4 years now, and it has protected me from the cruel New England weather. Do I need to buy a Canada Goose parka? 

Any information is appreciated enormously. I’ve heard many many great things about U of T, as well as Canada. I’m mad stoked to get to know the school more. Also I’ve been a long-time drake fan, although I liked his earlier mixtapes better than the Kiki shit and the reckless dancing along the car.

To all those a little lost...,154,39,"I've wanted to post this for a while but I felt like I didn't really have a right to. But since today is my last day before summer semester starts, I figured I could just type this quickly. It's pretty long but I hope it helps :)

Just to give a quick background, I'm a LifeSci student (so nothing dealing with CS and POSt) and I'm going into my third year. In high school, I took no AP/IB courses and I cruised my way through, until UofT.

In first year, I finished with a 1.6 cGPA. My dreams of going to med school were absolutely crushed and I thought about ending my life countless times. I was struggling with myself (both physically and mentally), and with family and financial problems arising as well, I just didn't want to continue anymore. Forget becoming a doctor--I was struggling to not get on probation. I had my first major meltdown during the summer semester last year and I really thought it was the end of the road for me.

I've just finished second year and I've gotten a 3.8/4.0 respectively, significantly boosting my cGPA. This post isn't to humblebrag about my achievements but to list out what I changed, what I've learned from this journey, and in hopes that it'll help someone else too. I understand that this won't work for everyone since the path to becoming a doctor is very different from say, grad school for CS or something, but I'm sure some parts may be applicable.

The first thing I did was check myself in with H&W. I give this tip to everyone--if you want help, get it NOW. You don't want to go to H&W in December when lines are at their all-time long, with everyone struggling with final exams. Summer (from my experience) generally has the shortest wait times. The process to get a psychiatrist takes quite a while with multiple people you have to see and wait for, so do it soon.

The second thing also pertains to health. I went through a full checkup last year and found that I had 2 health problems that impacted me quite a bit, had I let them go on any further without treatment. Neither of them had significant symptoms which is why I didn't even realize I was sick until my doctor checked. I get my blood drawn at least once a year, and I normally get a checkup done over the summer, when I have more free time. Your body is your engine--without a healthy, functioning body, it's going to be hard to perform at your best. Take care of yourself. I'm a little shy so I don't go to the gym, but I've changed my eating habits (I use Hellofresh which is a little pricey but I enjoy the meals) and I do a bit of yoga in the morning and a routine I can quickly do in my dorm during the evening. Figure out what's best for you!

Moving on to academics, I tell people who are entering to be flexible. When I entered, I had this stupid mindset that I HAD to do a certain major because I wanted to be a doctor. But most med schools these days don't care what you took in uni, or they have very few required courses that they want you to take. Figure out what you like and are good at, and find a major that encompasses both. Your registrar is a good place to start if you're not sure what UofT offers. For example, I'm pretty bad at physics, but I thought for some reason I would ace it in uni. Spoiler: I failed most of the tests and I only passed because I did okay on the assignments/practicals. GPA is forever, so unless something is required for your major, I'd play it safe. I found out later that I had a knack for writing which is why I took courses in Health Sciences, Global Health, and Bioethics, all of which I got A-/A's in. Be flexible.

Have a planner. I have no idea how I got through first year without a planner, but I have one of those giant four-month calendars from the bookstore, and at the beginning of each semester, I write down all the important dates that's listed on each syllabus. This is absolutely critical for me to do, since there generally will be a day/week where I'll have like, 4 assignments and 3 midterms. Being able to see this means that I'll be able to plan earlier. I also have a physical planner that I got from Aliexpress that I carry with me at all times, as well as Google Calendar for alarms on my phone.

The next tip I have is to meet up with professors. I find this harder to do for STEM courses because I can't think of good questions (or I don't even know what I don't know *cough*) but for more arts-based courses, I track down every note the professor writes for me and if I don't understand how I can do better, I'll always go in and ask. I scored my first 95's and 100's in my essays this semester and it felt so satisfying to see that my hard work paid off. The other great thing is that professors will also know you by name, and I had two this year who offered to write recommendation letters for me if I ever needed them, and I was also able to land some good research/volunteer/work experience through them. Introduce yourself, make them know that you want to do better and you're going to put in the effort.

Get involved. You're not going to make friends easily at Con Hall because everyone sits in a different place every lecture, and you're there to learn anyways, not meet new people and chat. I met my closest friends through clubs and student unions, and I had so much fun being involved and leading such an amazing group of people. I was lucky enough to win awards and also had the chance to put my experience in my resume, which also helped me land research/volunteer/work positions with a less-than-subpar cGPA. An upwards trend also looks good too.

Lastly, don't give up. I know sometimes that's not realistic but this also goes with being flexible. I'm sure with CS and POSt, it's not so easy as saying 'oh you can try again next year' but I'm sure there are different ways to get to the end goal, with CS just being a big stepping stone towards that dream. The same goes for med school. My cGPA (even if I get straight 4.0's from today on) won't be recoverable enough to meet the minimum cGPA for some schools. But it means that I have to focus on schools that I will have a decent chance in. And if it doesn't work the first time, I'll either do a fifth year, a second degree, or a masters degree. Be flexible in how you get to that goal, because sometimes it won't be the path that you'll expect to take. I guess this is an idealistic way of thinking and again, I know these tips don't apply for a lot of people. But through my two years here, I've learned so much about myself that I actually wouldn't change it for the world. I'd still return to UofT and go through all of this again because I feel that my time here has been worth it. Maybe I would've been happier at UBC or McGill, but I chose UofT and I'm glad I did.

Changing my mindset, being more flexible, and fixing a few lifestyle choices into healthier habits helped me immensely this year. I have no idea what my future is going to be like but regardless, I've never regretted coming here. We're spending our youth to learn new things and hopefully find decent jobs and live a decent life, so I (at least) really wanted to make my time here count. Granted, the next two years could go horribly for me, but I'm still going to do my best.

I hope this helps someone, especially since I understand how hard and brutal this school can be at times. And if you ever need anyone to talk (even if you're older or study something completely different than me), feel free to shoot me a PM!",8hhbp7,UofT

This Reddit is getting a little toxic about the UPass... let's try to be more empathetic towards each other.,97,62,"  Let me try something...    
  
Let's take the perspective of the people who spend $0 or less than $70 a month ONLY. Yeah it's really shit if this passes. Suddenly you get signed up for something you never agreed to - kinda like how you never signed up to get born, but you did anyways and you need to worry about this shit. Now your budget might be tighter since using TTC was just a luxury. Now it's forced upon you and your wallet hurts. Plus, if you 're a go-train user you lose your discount and need to spend even more money. How is this fair?     

If we take the perspective of the commuters ONLY: It will be great, because this benefits us financially. For those paying for the metropass, that's almost a $50 discount/month x 4 = $200. It's already really shit that we have to commute. Heck, I need to plan 3 hours for a 50 minute class (if it's at 10AM, i need to wake up at 8, get to the station at 9, and still might be late if I miss all the trains, then need another hour and a little to get back home if it's past 3PM). Sometimes I don't even go to class because it's only 50 minutes and it takes me 2 hours to commute + $6 - it doesn't feel like it's worth my time. Given that there's a free to use metropass, maybe I'll just stay downtown for longer, commute to Eaton centre, get some lunch, relax a little before I head home because I don't need to worry about dropping $3 everytime I want to go somewhere that's out of walking distance (esp. in this weather).        
    
So what should we try and think about? I'm actually on both sides because I really hate TTC and manage to spend less than $50 a month on transit. I was also living in a dorm in my first year, and never ~needed~ to use the TTC at all. But the fact is (if this does go through) why be mad about something you can't change? I'd just take my anger and just ABUSE the TTC. I'm at Robarts and I need to get to museum? Ite, let me take the 94. I'm at museum and I need to get to Woodsworth? K, I'm just gonna go from museum--> st.george. Use the pass to your advantage. Make it worth. Of course you don't HAVE to. You can just stay angry and talk about how shit this is, but at the end of the day, you still HAVE an unlimited usage pass at your disposal. Might as well just use it. Heck, if I had the pass, maybe I wouldn't have gone to metro every tuesday for groceries. Maybe I would've commuted to someother supermarket (e.g. T&T). Now all your friends have metropasses, just go wherever the hell you want. TTC actually spans pretty far, you can go to Yorkdale, Fairview, Eaton, Richmond Hill, airport. Idk, it is very unfair to people who dont use it to begin with, but if it passes, it passes. Life sucks sometimes, and maybe there will be a silver lining if you start using the TTC more. You might explore, find new places, try more restaurants, go out more, find a cute person on the bus, w.e.    

Just my 2 cents... and $280/semester xD. Just try to be positive and kind to each other. Everybody's in different financial situations, and even if it's unfair to you, it might've sucked even more for someone who commutes on a daily. It might not have, and you didn't do anything to deserve it, but hey, it's life~~. 

EDIT: Hmm.. It seem's that people are misunderstanding my tone for being condescending? I am just giving a situation for if the UPass passes, because that's the outcome that's most likely going to stir a lot of anger. IF it passes, what are you going to do? You can't opt out, you can't prevent it from happening, you can drop out (unreasonable), so the most reasonable thing is to accept it as it is and then use it to your advantage. I went over how it's unfair for noncommuters, and I am also someone who doesn't even spend close to $50 a month for commuting. I'm just hoping to help find a silver lining in this situation, since there's no use being upset/angry at things you cant change. ",86ewo3,UofT

Student lounges in On-Campus buildings,4,5,"In anticipation of finals, what buildings do you know that have student lounges/study spaces that aren't classrooms? Where are they in the building?

Most of my class buildings don't have lounges/study spaces (RIP psych majors) so I'm hoping to come up with a decent list of buildings that have lounges on campus. It would be great if you could include any amenities (has plenty of outlets!) or drawbacks (only available to people in XYZ major).

I'm going with classroom buildings so the library, Squires, GBJ student center, the GLC, and dining halls aren't on here.

To start the list:

Litton-Reaves: Two lounges on the first floor, one to the right of the main entrance and one down the hall to the left. Some outlets, but not at every seat; chairs and tables.

Sandy: First floor is mostly lounge space, open to only neuroscience majors after a certain time (10pm?). Not sure about outlet situation; chairs and tables.

New Classroom Building: Lounge on 1st floor by Derring parking lot entrance, study spaces/mini lounges on every floor on far ends. Outlets in all the mini study spaces, not sure about the lounge; mostly tables, a few individual chairs.

Williams: 4 tables by the front door, usually full during the day. Maybe outlets by the two back tables; no individual chairs

Lavery (Turner Place): Ledges for sitting on 3rd and 4th floor along hallway. No tables, two small (1-2 person) couches at the very end of the hall, few outlets.

Davidson: Chem study lounge on 2nd floor; two tables with bench seats on first floor, usually full. Tables and chairs; plenty of outlets at the bench seat tables, not sure about the lounge.",e63oks,VirginiaTech

Thinking about transferring from VCU to tech - Advice please,3,18,"Hi there!

This will be a bit of a long post but bare with me. VCU was my first choice school, since I can't drive due to my vision I was excited to be somewhere that always had stuff going on. I really do like the city of Richmond, and I love the diversity, but there's been a lot of things that VCU doesn't seem to have. I didn't think I wanted a ""traditional"" college experience, but I find I'm really missing a sense of community and ""college"" feel. I've tried clubs and putting myself out there but I still don't feel connected to my school. I feel really lonely and it doesn't feel like many people are excited to be here. My hall isn't social at all, our RA's don't do anything, and most on campus events are non-existent or a flop. It just isn't feeling right and we're coming to the end of the first semester. (I posted about my feelings in the VCU subreddit if you wanna look at my post history)

I read online there's no way to do spring semester transfer, right? What's it like transferring as a sophomore? Is it hard to fit in? Do you miss out? Does campus get boring? Is there lots of stuff to do? How accepting are people? Upperclassman, are you still enjoying being at Virginia tech? Also, this is a bit random, but I was considering joining a sorority at VCU, if I do, I couldn't join one at tech, right? What classes should I take if I decide I want to transfer? If anyone has come from VCU I'd love to hear from you!

Prairie Quad Dorms,6,2,"Here's some facts I complied when I was picking where I wanted to live in this year.

**New Rez east:**

Floors 1,2,3 have large window common areas (for the most part), 4th floor doesn't.

Odd #’s 90-60 face Owens (e.g. window in room 3**9**1 faces Owens)

Even #’s 90-60 face prairie quad

Odd #’s 10-50 face Lee quad

Even #’s 00-60 face prairie quad

Highest and lowest are ends of hall,

High =Payne

Low= PY

middle #’s are closer to 90 degree turn in middle hall.

&#x200B;

**Payne hall:**

Top floor drillfield side does overlook war's roof

Even numbers face drillfield

Odd numbers face prairie quad

Third floor drillfield side isn’t all that great to look out from.

Has a 4th floor, may or may not have good windows

**Peddrew Yates (PY):**

from outside it looks like NRHE but flipped (assuming numbers are flipped as well)

Virginia Tech and Hemp flower (CBD),6,3,"Does Virginia Tech have a policy about hemp flower, specifically in terms of use by staff and/or possession in the dorms?

The whole country is in a weird limbo with regards to cannabis so it got me thinking about Tech. High-CBD hemp flower is legal nationwide because of the last Farm Bill (I believe) and Tech even has an industrial hemp research program. I just bought some online and I've heard Nice Dreams sells it.

But I know certain workplaces can make their own rules and although it would be insane for someone to get in trouble for CBD, I'm sure it happens.

To further complicate matters, I just saw [this story](https://www.nbc12.com/2019/10/21/judge-tosses-marijuana-charge-man-who-legally-purchased-cbd-product/) yesterday. Apparently VA's state lab can't tell the difference between legal hemp and THC-marijuana...so technically if a person is caught with simple possession, they can just claim it's legal hemp flower and not the scary marijuana.

I hope this letter finds you safe, well, and enjoying the start of your summer break, whether that includes classes, an internship or job, service, or travel. I also hope you find some time for rejuvenation, relaxation, and fun.  


We have heard from students that many are concerned about the size of our incoming class. As you know, Virginia Tech is undergoing a period of managed growth to achieve an undergraduate population of 30,000 by 2023, but the larger-than-expected response to offers of admission this year far exceeded both our expectations and our plan.   


Based on the results of a survey completed by students who accepted offers of admission, we believe that this was due to the high visibility and academic reputation of our university and enhanced recruitment and admissions procedures that were implemented this year.  Clearly, the enrollment management model used to establish the numbers of applicants offered admission will need further development in the future, and we are actively engaged in accomplishing this necessity.  


I am reaching out today to let you know that we are committed to maintaining a quality student experience and are working diligently to accommodate the larger incoming class. As a campus community, Virginia Tech is working to ensure that all of our new and returning Hokies have an amazing student experience.  


To manage the higher-than-expected enrollment in a manner that preserves and advances the educational experience for both incoming and continuing students, the Provost has assembled a team of campus leaders to work collaboratively to develop strategies for accommodating academic, housing, dining, wellness needs, and more. We are finding solutions and using the financial resources generated by the increased enrollment to serve the entire student community. We are making good progress.  


If you haven’t already, I encourage you to check out our site for entering first-year students [\#VT23 Frequently Asked Questions](https://t.send.vt.edu/r/?id=h86f727,14d0631,14d0634&utm_source=cmpgn_vtmail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelDirectEmailCMP_DM84136). The FAQ page includes information on housing and Living-Learning Programs, dining, Orientation, parking, and counseling services that may interest you. We will continue to add content to this resource page in response to community needs, requests and questions.  


If you have questions regarding this larger-than-expected first-year class that are not addressed in the #VT23 FAQ, send an email to [askvt@vt.edu](mailto:askvt@vt.edu) and the appropriate office will respond. Your questions will help us build out the FAQ page so that your inquiries and our responses can assist others.  


It is important that we keep you informed by sharing all we are doing so that both returning students and new students have the best opportunity to thrive as they [ExperienceVT](https://t.send.vt.edu/r/?id=h86f727,14d0631,14d0635&utm_source=cmpgn_vtmail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelDirectEmailCMP_DM84136). As returning students and “seasoned” family members, you can model the Virginia Tech motto, *Ut Prosim* (That I May Serve), by welcoming, assisting, guiding, and befriending our newest Hokies.  


Students and their families are excited about the opportunities presented by a Virginia Tech education, and we are excited to do the most we can to provide the very best experience for all our students. Thank you for your unwavering loyalty and undaunted Hokie spirit.  


Have a wonderful summer! I look forward to seeing you in August!",bx4hca,VirginiaTech
Freshman dorm recommendations?,2,8,"My housing choice thing opens on Tuesday, and I think I've narrowed it down to either Newman, Vawter, or Slusher.  Does anyone have any suggestions or advice?",8tkunq,VirginiaTech
Move-In Week Advice,96,7,"Some helpful hints for our new incoming Hokies:


1. Please, PLEASE, **PLEASE** be patient, and remind the parental units to do the same. This goes for pretty much anywhere in Blacksburg and if you happen to call 4-Help. There are lots of people trying to get to the same area at the same time. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to get from point A to point B.

2. For help connecting your smart devices (game systems, tvs, etc), there should be a handy guide in each room, and there was also a sheet you should have gotten from 4-Help during Orientation, that has information on how to connect said devices. If neither option is available to you, there should be nice 4-Help folks in the dorms to help out. Failing those options, 4-Help is available 24/7 to get you squared away. Our number is 540-231-4357.  
Note that the wireless portion of your wireless printer should not be used. Instead, please use a USB cable to connect your printer to your computer when you need to print.

3. 4-Help is available 24/7 for any technical or account issues you might have. Please not that this is only in relation to VT networks and accounts. If your computer bricks or is behaving in an unexpected fashion, first try restarting it (they should be restarted every couple of days for good health, as should smart phones and like devices). If that doesn't work, please contact either the point of purchase or the manufacturer. We are not equipped to help you figure out why your computer won't turn on.

4. If you need help installing software and feel like you need a person with you to help you figure out, there is an in-person help desk in Torgersen Bridge that is staffed 10am to 5pm each day through the 30th. Please feel free to drop by and someone will be glad to help you.

5. If your parental units are having trouble logging in to a certain page, make sure they are in the right place first. Remind them that Hokie Spa is ONLY for students and staff. Parents use their guest logins on the guest access page (guest.banner.vt.edu) or, if they're trying to make some sort of payment, they should be going to Hokie Wallet (wallet.vt.edu). If they are still having issues, please have them call us.

Welcome to VT! :)",ctgoqx,VirginiaTech

Business majors - Everything in our tour including the welcoming video and script during the campus walking tour all focused on engineering programs. Why are you at VT?

Having also visited other schools (BC, Penn St, JMU, Providence), the facilities (library, rec center, dorms) at VT seemed outdated. Even the asphalt pathway in the drill field seemed cheap. How would you rate the facilities there as being a plus or minus in your school experience.

TIA",d0l35b,VirginiaTech

Are you allowed to ship something like a vape mod to a dorm's mail center?,2,7,"Alright, now at first glance this might sound like a really dumb question due to the whole ""smoke free campus"" policy here, but just hear me out. My problem is that I cant find any sort of guidelines anywhere that clarify what exactly that entails. From my understanding, ""smoke free campus"" just means you cannot USE tobacco, vape, etc. products on campus, but you may still possess them. So I guess my first question is am I correct in that assumption? My next question is, given that you ARE allowed to possess such products on campus, are you then allowed to have these items shipped to you through your community's mail center? I can't find any sort of guidelines or rules as to what you can and can't receive through the mail centers on campus, which I guess goes hand in hand with my possession question. Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)",dk0g76,ucf

I hate it here,0,7,"So I’m living in Libra with my roommate and if she’s not in classes, she’s on her bed tippity tapping away at her computer till about 2am. Other than that, she’s a wonderful person, very neat, respectful, and an inspirational scholar. I just need my space and sleep :( I brought it up early on and she offered to start going to the library which worked out for a bit but then she just kinda gave up on going. I usually end up leaving the room to cry in my car for hours. The thing is, she’s not technically doing anything wrong but it’s driving me insane to the point where I had an attempted suicide and was sent to the hospital for 3 days. I tried talking to my RA and a Coordinator after deciding to go through with the mediation thing so I can just get a new roommate that maybe I can be friends with or something but I’m worried housing is going to tell me to suck it up. I can’t afford to cancel the agreement and just move to an apartment (it’s $1000 at this point and turns to $1250 after December 12th) and one of my classes is only available on campus so I’m hesitant to just move back home (4 hours away) and be an online student. I feel trapped in Orlando with this girl who I just can’t stand and it’s honestly ruining the college experience I worked so hard for. 

If anyone has any advice or knowledge I’m absolutely down to take it whether it’s about communication with my roommate or asking for a new one. Can I use my depression and social anxiety to my advantage when housing decides to get back to me? Is it possible to move to Neptune or Lake Claire without paying an extra fee?

As of Nov 1st, 2018:

• The case number is 9773204 and the firm handling it is Morgan & Morgan ###UPDATE### Morgan & Morgan has refused to take the case, anyone know any sort of law firms that would?

• Channel 6 ran a story on it, nobody is surprised that CV and UCF bought them out and played down the problem, WESH 2 is covering it as well soon.

• Currently in the process of hiring a PI

• The developers of UW offered $150 in compensation in response to a petition that made rounds about 2 months ago, presumed to actually be in response to the suit since the compensation was dispersed shortly after the GroupMe chats for most floors were notified

• UCF/Valencia and the developers of UW have commented, in full damage control, buying out media outlets left and right

• A list of grievances is in the process of being created

• Representatives from floors 8 and 15 are confirmed for collecting specific grievances, possible reps from floors 7, 9, 11, 14

• No representatives as of yet from floors 6, 10, 12, 13

• Current demands (if choose to settle out of court) include reimbursement of paid rent, waiving of spring rent, and waiving of all cancellation fees

• NEW GRIEVANCES!!! Non-ADA and NFPA compliance, mold growing EVERYWHERE, people in wheelchairs unable to exit the building during a fire, two students left in dorms for 20+ minutes during a fire drill, improper ventilation for dorms

UCF reopens Friday,28,19,"Based on the current path and timeline for Hurricane Dorian, UCF will remain closed through Thursday, Sept. 5, and reopen Friday, Sept. 6.

Current projections indicate wind speeds overnight will be weaker than earlier forecasts predicted. Students who were required to move into campus ride-out locations in anticipation of hurricane-force winds have been permitted to return to their residence halls, which are safe indoor spaces given the storm’s latest weakened wind and rain projections. Shuttles are available to transport them.

Police, fire and medical assistance will be able to respond to emergencies in the anticipated conditions. If you’re a student who’s on campus and needs help, UCF Police can be reached 24/7 by calling 911.

All academic assignments, including those in classes with online components, remain suspended until classes resume Friday.

UCF continues to encourage faculty to be flexible with students who heeded early warnings and chose to evacuate. Students should not be impacted academically for putting their personal safety first, and any student who has difficulty returning in time for Friday classes should contact their faculty members directly. 

The UCF Creative School for Children also will reopen on Friday.

UCF Downtown, the Rosen College of Hospitality Management, the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona and all regional campuses will remain closed on Thursday. In addition, some regional campuses may remain closed longer until their partner institutions resume operations. More information is available in the hurricane coverage at www.ucf.edu.

As we return to normal operations at UCF, there are resources available to assist students who have been impacted by Hurricane Dorian.

The Knights Helping Knights Pantry, which will open Friday, provides free food, toiletries, clothing and other items to students, no questions asked. UCF students who present a valid student ID can pick out as many as five food items a day, and there’s no limit on toiletries or clothing. Knights Pantry is in Ferrell Commons by All Knight Study.

If you purchased more food than needed to prepare for Hurricane Dorian, consider donating unused items to Knights Pantry.

UCF Cares is available to assist with overall student well-being, including financial difficulties. Student Care Services’ office in Ferrell Commons will reopen Friday, and staff members can be reached at 407-823-5607 or ucfcares@ucf.edu.

Here’s my f*cking assignment for your consideration.,138,73,"What can I say about my experience at UofM...

I can praise the quality of education but who am I to gauge. I learned a lot during my time here. Much of that information was from faculty from the university. 

I guess my problem with this question is the implicit call to praise UofM. By the tone of these sentences, it may be obvious that I very much hesitate in doing so. I can preface my criticisms by saying that I have met and learned from the smartest most talented people I have ever come across, and I grew into something I am proud, here. I am grateful to the admittance board for deciding I was worthy of that. I am grateful that I will have a degree that will open doors because of the name of this university rather than my qualifications alone…  


I am grateful for the friends I made and the success I am achieving through the university…

However, much of that journey was wrought with break downs, suicidal ideation, and a repressed frustration I am now taking this opportunity to vent…

One early frustration I need to mention is the feeling I can sense coming from the reader, through spacetime, into my phone as I type this. “No pain no gain!” The unreasonably simplistic solution presented from nearly everyone who goes here, to a problem faced by nearly everyone who goes here. The excuse for a poorly designed system, justified and perpetuated by the ego that is gained from success in that system… even if that success is temporary and/or theoretical.   


But it’s ok, CAPS is always available, and we are comforted in the knowledge that we are all suffering together!  

The UofM culture prides itself in the rigor given to its students, but is this something to be proud of? Is it an achievement to make assignments that require 10s of hours of work on, given a deadline that strongly encourages the loss of sleep and a healthy lifestyle? The university systemically promotes students to sacrifice quality of life and mental health to get a better grade. One of the first recommendations from my advisor was to make sure I take time to walk around outside… I now see this was because being cooped up in a lab until 3:00AM can be a negative on your moral.

The second problematic factor I see in this system is the method of evaluation.

Exams, homework, labs. Nearly every class is flooded with tedious work that fails, or completely ignores, the target being evaluated (i.e. has the student learned x) and focuses on increasing length of the evaluation method (i.e. can the student complete this assignment in the time limit). The methods of evaluation often do test for knowledge of different pertinent material (although many times incompletely), however they almost always involve an unholy amount of tedium and memorization. 

In my opinion, the most frustrating result of the evaluation process is the false negatives. I have run into dozens of occasions where graders and professors have both given me feedback that are along the lines of:

“its obvious you know the material, but what you wrote was incorrect on a technicality.”

More often than not, I demonstrate that this technicality is something I am aware of and proven that I do elsewhere, but perhaps, for example, I misread a question. I am of course always willing to demonstrate it again, but this is rarely an offer taken. 

Lemma 1:

If a professor/grader evaluates a student as not knowing something that the student has or is willing to concretely demonstrate their knowledge in, the failure is not of the student, but of the evaluator and/or the evaluation methodology.

To give an even more radical idea: 

A successful system of education does not require lemma 1 to be dependent on deadlines within of a semester. 

(See: many other countries)

My experience at UofM quickly became inundated by the feeling that the university did not have the goal of my success and was in fact out for blood. 

I have failed assignments, exams, nearly some courses, and a course, all whilst having verbal confirmation from those corresponding professors that I am one of their top students - asking all the right questions, engaging with the material, helping other students understand concepts. These failures were overwhelmingly due to the insane workload and the negative feedback loop that it had on my mental health. 

I guess I can separate my experience into three chapters: pre-hospitalization, pre-research, and now. In each chapter I can tell you the lessons I have learned, some of them useful outside of the university. 

Pre-hospitalization:

During a period that I was pushed to my tipping point, I had a 2-hour exam for one of my courses. I had a panic attack during the exam and due to the time left after calming myself I had to fill in a few answers with educated guesses. If this didn’t affect my grade enough, at the last minute I realized I marked my answers off by one for nearly half my exam. After failing that exam and ultimately taking a blow to my GPA, I became very depressed and isolated. I felt so wronged by this experience. I felt that my knowledge was irrelevant to my grade. I felt that my professors could hardly care about their undergraduates students’ successful retention of material, and were just going through the motion, focused on their own research, teaching as a formality. 

The next semester I had a nervous breakdown – I was completely disillusioned and terrified. The experience left me checked in at the psychiatric emergency center at the UofM hospital. I considered leaving UofM. I was very close to doing so.  Against the advice of my father, and therapist, I stayed. I stayed because I wanted to triumph my demons - a sentiment I think is silly in hindsight. I bought into the idea that this pain was part of the UofM experience, when in actuality the most profound step into self-mastery was when I had a break from it all (as I will mention later).

I learned that I am either a false negative or a false positive - either the system is wrong, or I don’t belong in it. But university assured me that I do belong here, and my skepticism about it was just imposter syndrome. So, I reasoned that in a system as complex as an educational institution, false negatives are either not effectively tracked or not effectively cared about. 

Pre-research:

I am recovering and part of that recovery is to allow myself to be angry and speak up for myself - to self-actualize. I took it easy for a semester. When things got too hairy, I dropped classes. I moved out of my crappy dimly lit dorm. I made time for archery. However, the most profound experience of, quite possibly, my life, was during three weeks of a summer I spent alone, with my time, with my ambition, with my confidence, with my talent, and without micromanagement. I decided to learn on my own and build projects myself. I woke up early naturally because I was motivated and well rested. I made amazing strides in my mental health. 

I learned that I deserve my time.   


Now:

The rest of the summer I decided to get into research to open up the possibility for grad school. After not hearing back from my first choice professor, and after my academic advisor reassured my interests by telling me it was pointless to try to go to any of the big schools (including UofM) because my GPA was under 3.5 (3.3 at the time), I decided to ignore both and apply to another lab last minute. I have been told I nailed the interview. I began working under/with people I now consider to be my first friends at UofM – definitely the first people to give a shit. I felt valued for my research ideas and insights. I felt like I was finally doing science and not being quizzed in some fundamentally flawed system that sees me as a name, ID number, and the one professional looking photo I had available to put on my ID. The research community has many downsides, and a similar unhealthy mindset of work until you finish or break down, but surprisingly not to the same extent, and the liberty and respect of self-management and goal definition is... liberating. 

Unfortunately, summers end, and seeing the other side of the tunnel made the length and mucky constricting nature of the tunnel feel even more infuriating. I had friends, respect, and other positive reinforcement from research, but since research only counts for credit once at UofM, I had to try to balance both. I was in a semi unique position as a student and researcher, and I saw the table from both sides. I also saw the ugliest parts of both worlds…  


Faculty and grad students harassed and discriminated against. Professors getting away with threatening and verbally abusing students. I fell victim to all of the above as well, and I saw the universities disappointing reaction (or lack thereof) to the situations. 

Eventually research led me to make my own business. Because of my limited time I had to drop research. But I am now at this point of being frustrating clear on the illogical methods of evaluation and the toxic culture this university prides itself in. Seeing the behind the scenes just makes consider dropping out rather than taking my last semester.

I learned that the university holds their students to a higher standard than their faculty. I learned that not considering the specifics of a situation during evaluation is the duct tape that holds the university together and it’s the birth of a great many of its injustices. I learned that your heroes are probably just assholes. I learned that the real talents to be treasured at this university are taken advantage of, over worked, underpaid, disrespected, harassed. I learned that big name faculty can get away with anything. I learned that those here on a visa are especially vulnerable to abuse. I learned that the red carpet will be rolled out for the most unnervingly problematic, manipulative, and abusive faculty, but the university will find any reason to put a glass ceiling above an extremely skilled, hard-working, faculty with an integrity that restores my hope in academia. I learned that this is commonplace when the first is a man and the second is a woman.

I learned that the most talented people I have ever met flock here only to get their dreams slowly chipped away at, until they eventually question their value and if they are worthy of being here.",e78fae,uofm

As I was about to leave the sidewalk and enter the road, I saw this Northwood Blue Bus steer left, into my way, and it did not stop even though I was gesturing to enter the crosswalk.

I saw it steer into my way and I slammed on the brakes of my scooter, and I flew out and ate shit on the pavement. The bus just kept going. I didn’t catch what number it was, just that it was a Northwood bus. This was about 5:40 PM. I have the exact location of where I crashed on google maps. It’s right next to the University Hospital. Someone saw me trip over and offered me a ride, but I told her no because I thought my left knee was good but that was just the adrenaline. It fucking hurts right now and my thumb also hurts like shit because I landed on it wrong. I don’t have a recording of this, but I did take a picture of my spin and the spot I was at.

Could ucla style dorm housing scale to the general public?,3,7,"I used to be a ucla student years ago, and I remember living in sproul and rieber hall (never hedrick, thank god I did not have to climb even higher up into the mountains to get back home).  One of the defining features is that we were crammed into tiny sardine can like rooms.  There were shared restrooms in the center of each floor, and we had access to cafeteria style eatery in the place of a kitchen one might find in a typical apartment.

&#x200B;

Seemed like a hyper efficient setup, even though what I paid seemed too high for the space I lived in.  What if that kind of setup was put in areas that were not as expensive as Westwood or on UCLA property?  That might be a way to get much cheaper living spaces in the general Los Angeles area and help solve the housing supply problem in many metro areas.

&#x200B;

How much would that cost outside a school setting?  Was the price I paid, and many of you currently pay still massively subsidized?  Is it the cost of the food service baked into the housing costs?  Utilities can't be that bad in such small spaces right?

&#x200B;

Curious to hear what you all think of this.  I don't think this would be ideal long term living for most people, but I'm reminded of those coffin sized hotels in cities like Tokyo where expenses are so high, it is one of the only way for many people to afford a place to stay in certain areas of the city at lower rates... sometimes.

Dorm advice,7,18,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on a dorm issue.

I am a male freshman placed in a plaza triple (shared bathroom) in Sunset Village. As you may know, it is very socially dead. The only people I really know in the building are my roommates, because most other people are upperclassmen, and the other freshmen do not participate in events all that much. It's honestly a depressing atmosphere. The only people I see on a daily basis are my roommates. It's not what I envisioned a fun dorm experience to be like.

I was wondering, do I have any options for trying to switch out? I know there was a roommate swap event earlier this quarter, but I did not begin to feel troubled by this situation until after that, so I didn't go. I would like to switch into a classic triple, which is what I requested on the housing app. I've heard that there's a chance to switch in the winter quarter, and I was wondering if I'd be likely to find an open spot in a classic triple at that time.

Any advice on options for switching out would be appreciated, my current situation is starting to interfere with my ability to focus on schoolwork. Thanks!",9tzwgs,ucla

Has anyone had any previous experience with moving rooms half way through the school year? I'm hoping to move to a single in Rieber Vista... How do I know if a room like this is open/who do I contact about moving rooms?

Thanks for the help! ",am0fvu,ucla

We’re weeks into the school year and it’s still impossible to sleep at night in these dorms,32,27,"I have not slept comfortably since the school year started up. These dorms are incredibly hot at night and it’s unbearable. I have asthma that reacts really poorly to heat and it makes it so hard to breathe and sleep at night. 

I get not having AC in the residence halls. It’d be expensive, hard to manage and be very wasteful energy wise. Here’s what I don’t get, these buildings don’t seem to be designed to control the temperature any other way. There are ways to cool down a room/building without ac, you’d think a university would find a way to do it 

For example, the dorms could not have these giant fucking windows with flimsily blinds that’s hardly block out the sun, making it so that during the day the sun just beats down hard on you and because it’s going through a big window into a tiny dorm it’s gonna heat up your room tremendously. 

At night? Idk what they could do but come on this school is full of engineers and no one has ever wanted to try and efficiently (both cost and energy) allow us to just enjoy the temperatures of our rooms?

TL;DR: it’s still hella hot every night and because of my asthma I can barely breath why can’t we find a way to cool down these fucking dorms",d8i8kr,rutgers

For Public Release: Complaint Against Rutgers University- New Brunswick NJPIRG Referendum,225,37,"Read the complaint [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16DG1o6x_B8FHhehBR3nfBFI2Ma1p0qkdDovQMVQXIgY/edit?usp=sharing).

This complaint, in full, has been sent to the Oversight Committee. An abbreviated version of the report was also sent the Targum.

For those who are just joining in, please read this post [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/dwucw5/i_would_like_to_formally_file_a_complaint_about/).  Please continue to share your experiences regarding the referendum there (or here) and if you have photo or video evidence that you would like to be submitted for consideration, please pm me.

I will update everyone once I get a response from the Oversight Committee.

Most importantly, I would like to thank everyone who submitted comments on their experiences and those who assisted me in shaping the complaint into what it is.

Edit: I almost forgot: A source has informed me that tomorrow, November 18th, is the last day NJPIRG can continue its referendum activities. If you see anything wrong or suspicious with the way poll workers/campaigners are conducting themselves, please take photos or videos and pm me. I will then be able to supplement the complaint with more concrete evidence.

Edit 2: I was informed by a source that voting within classrooms was approved by the Oversight Committee. ~~(This correspondence will be published in about an hour when I have access to my laptop).~~  As promised:

>As a heads up, we did approve mobile polling locations, based on precedent from the Targum referendum. Here is the exact language , thus it would be a violation to go into dorms, to make an announcement without a professors consent , or if the appeal language was not visible.  
>  
>NJPIRG Oversight Committee Ruling #4 11/4/19 4 voting in favor, 1 against, 1 abstaining  
>  
>The Oversight Committee can approve certain poll workers or referendum coordinators to be “mobile polling locations”. The following rules apply to this stipulation: The OC must be informed of these individuals and their identities must be approved BEFORE they can be mobile polling location workers The OC must be informed of the times that workers will be working as mobile polling location workers In compliance with Article VII. Section B) “Campaigning shall be allowed in favor or opposition of the referendum and its passage by lobbying voters at distances of at least fifty (50) feet from any polling unit voting location. No materials that encourage an affirmative or negative vote shall be visible within the aforementioned distance.” Poll workers must keep this in mind when soliciting votes. Soliciting within Residential dorms or non- Rutgers affiliated buildings are not permitted. Mobile poll workers must display the appeals to voters at all times. If an announcement is being made to vote, the appeal must be said orally. If announcements are being made in classrooms, verbal permission from the Professor must be obtained. Votes must be tallied by the mobile poll worker in the same way that votes must be tallied from standard polling locations.

&#x200B;

EDIT 11/18 10:07pm: Observations From the Last Day of NJPIRG Voting and Updates from the Oversight Committee

Higher-ups with the organization definitely read the complaint filed. Good for them.

Today, after my walkarounds Livingston and College Ave, polling stations and campaign booths were suddenly in compliance with Rutgers Policy 10.3.3 section VI.D and Rutgers Policy 10.3.3 section VII.B (see allegation 3). The fact that they're being very cautious with the campaigners/poll station distances suggests that NJPIRG knowingly were placing campaigners directly next to polling stations.

Furthermore, I only saw one polling station on both Livingston and College Ave. What I noticed was an uptick in ""mobile polling stations"" aka going to classrooms directly. Again, to reiterate my previous point, this type of voting was approved by the Oversight Committee.

The sudden compliance of NJPIRG to Rutgers Policy 10.3.3 does not dismiss the previous allegations filed against them.  I continue to urge the Oversight Committee to fully investigate those allegations.

&#x200B;

I submitted an Op-Ed to the Targum, which was basically an abbreviated version of the complaint filed. I was informed that I needed to provide identifying details, including name, email, school, and major in order for the Op-Ed to be published. At this time, I have declined to do so and will not be publishing the Op-Ed.

&#x200B;

**Minutes ago, the Oversight Committee replied to my email:**

>**Hello,**   
>  
>**Thank you for submitting your appeal. The Oversight Committee met at 8 pm today to discuss the appeals you filed.**   
>  
>**Appeal #4 was forwarded to Jackie Moran who is the Director of Compliance and Title IX Coordinator. She and her office will investigate the allegations of sexual harassment by poll workers.**   
>  
>**After looking at all of the appeals, we have determined that the appeals that we will most closely be looking into are Appeal #2 Item C and Appeal #3 Item B.**   
>  
>**At this time, the Oversight Committee is deliberating on further actions.**   
>  
>**Look at Rutgers Policy 10.3.3 XIV. for further information regarding Appeals Procedures.** 

While I am glad Appeals (Allegations) #2-4 are being investigated, I'm disappointed that the Oversight Committee will not be investigating Allegations #1 and #5. I truly believe that all allegations listed in the complaint should be fully investigated.

I feel like I’m constantly stressed because of some of the police reports that the Rutgers police sends out idk...

My parents suggested I take my suitcase with me to the exam and then go to the shuttle pickup location directly from the exam room.

I'm pretty sure just about everyone else will only be bringing their backpack to the exam. I've had Friday exams in previous semesters and no one brought their suitcases to those exams, either.

ROTC kids early morning and late night screaming,36,29,"Hey,
So I live in Wiley and always hear ROTC/Air Force kids screaming during their 6am training everyday or right now at 10pm. I understand it builds comradeship, but I believe they should be more considerate about people sleeping in the dorms next to track and field. Please don’t get me wrong, I have utmost respect(in fact almost joined ROTC myself) for students in these programs, but screaming to the point where other students’ sleep cycles are interrupted seems excessive to me given how important sleep is for students to function well. Side note: I can still hear them with closed windows. Can anything be done to improve the situation? I don’t want to be seen as someone that undermines students in that program, but I feel that it is crossing my(and other people living in dorms like Wiley/Tark/Owen) limits. 
Before somebody tells me to train with them early in the morning, I do too but at 7 am, so that 1 hour sleep deficit really bothers me. Anyone else feel like this? 

TLDR: respectfully asking solution to make ROTC/Air Force students to train silently without bothering people’s sleep in Wiley/Tark/Owen.",dm9zne,Purdue

The Data Mine Honest Review,15,2,"Honestly do it. Its a great resume booster. I did corporate partners cohort this semester and it was amazing. You get to work with top companies such as Ford, John Deere, Rolls Royce, etc. Some people tend to treat this amazing opportunity casually but in all honesty this really helps get your foot in the door for a lot of companies. This learning community is really what you make of it, you have amazing support from the faculty who want you to learn as much as you can and various other mentors from different cohorts of the learning community and even companies!. Next semester I am doing VIP through the data mine simply because I want to focus more on research, which is also an amazing opportunity. A lot of people tend to bash this learning community simply because the learning community requires you to take 1 programming course, but even then, the programming course is designed for complete beginners. The programming course also acts as a seminar which introduces you to a variety of different paths and is usually taken place in the Hillenbrand dining court. You can simply enjoy your food, talk to friends, or get your work done during this seminar. Plus you get to live in Hillenbrand (which is a really nice dorm)!

There are multiple different groups in the cohort which are all still expanding. More are also getting added. I highly recommend the data mine for anyone. Please take this with a grain of salt as well as I can only speak for Corporate Partners. One of my friends is in VIP and he really enjoyed his semester in it. I know some VIP groups can be quite difficult in terms of the time commitment.  I have genuinely enjoyed my time with Data mine and personally have gained a lot of valuable knowledge through the mentors available here. So I strongly recommend. Others may definitely disagree.

How to meet people as an upperclassman?,22,27,"This is kind of embarrassing to write, but here goes. I've been really struggling to meet people while here at Purdue. I transferred in last year from out of state as an upperclassman into an off campus apartment, so I've never lived in the dorms or attended BGR or anything like that. 

I just feel like it's basically impossible at this point to make new friends. It seems like almost everyone I meet already has a well established social group they hang out with. I've been told a lot of people find their friends in class or clubs. In all my classes, there's over 100 people easily, and it seems like they all just play on their phones before class starts, and any attempt on my part to make conversation doesn't yield much results. 

I barely have time for the one club I'm in with the mountain of schoolwork I have to do every week (as in 40+ hours of labs, homework, and studying). I also have a job to try and pay rent, so I have even less free time. I have a couple friends, (which feels like a miracle), but I don't get to see them very often. It's hard being a person with very few friends, and knowing that even with those few, you're towards the bottom of their friend list because they haven't known you very long.

The few people I have tried to hang out with, either from my classes or from other posts on Reddit asking for friends, usually we meet once or twice, then not anymore. I spend pretty much every weekend alone in my apartment because I have no where else to go and no one to hang out with.

I'm at my wits end. My parents had a great time in college, and hang out with their college friends all the time. College has been nothing but lonely and miserable for me so far. My advisor just told me I'll be here for another 2 1/2 years, so I'd really rather not spend that whole time alone.

I've currently signed a housing contract about 2 weeks ago. My preference is suite and single with AC is at the last and at the top are double/triples, double/triplets with AC. Does my preference affect the dorm placement? If it does, should I move all the AC rooms up in hopes of not getting placed into terrible rooms?(I'm not sure changing/updating contract will put me back as it said priority goes to ones that signed contract earlier...)

My son will presumably be moving into East in August (hopefully renovated). He'll be bringing his PS4 as well with some other gear. Now, I read in prior posts, some folks suggested bringing along your own router, but that seems to be specifically prohibited *in writing.* PSU IT wants users to connect via wifi, regardless of device. So, has wifi connectivity improved? Is online gaming possible using the PSU wifi in the dorms? Will downloading games and/or updates to the PS4 be feasible, or will it be like watching paint dry?

I really don’t think asking him to tidy his area would go over well. He also has a habit of not locking the door when he leaves.

We have some huge clients and I have experience in web development from this. (Note: Despite being an “intern” I am considered a full on employee within the company - I work on and manage sites, front and back end, of hospitals, pharmecutical companies, and much more) I do NOT want to follow web development as a career choice as the real money is in Software development. What should I do to prepare? What areas of math should I brush up on now, what classes should I and should I not take, what clubs should I join etc..

- To put it plainly, I enjoy the devils lettuce. Will it be easy to obtain? Are the campus security always on the lookout? Could I easily sneak off somewhere to light up / could I rip a pen out of my dorm without too much worry? I do not drink so idrc about alchohol however I’d like to know how Pennstate is on grass, I would hope its quite common like most colleges. Most importantly however, what is Pennstates policy on ganja and what will happen if Im caught?

- How’s the party scene? I plan on doing a lot of studying but I am quite a fan of the occaisonal party and I would assume its quite large speaking that the school is huge. 

- Where are your favorite places to hang with friends? 

- What is good OUTSIDE of campus? Cool places to go? Things to see? etc..

"Having ""retroactive"" FOMO",12,7,"I’m a senior here now and felt like posting about something I feel like I’m going through. I was really introverted in high school and always struggled making friendships outside of forced environments from school and sports. Things didn’t change when I started college because I started at a really small branch of Penn State. I worked a lot for a few years while commuting there but I was still soul searching for what I wanted to major in/do with myself. I jumped around a bit in terms of majors and never made friends. 

I eventually transferred to UP obviously and spent my first two semesters here still searching and without any real friends at all. Having to go directly off-campus did not help and only worsened the isolation. Long story short, I slowly started making effort to get involved in clubs and activities and I found a major that I really love, so that solved a big question mark. Now I’m a senior and slowly but surely I’ve made around around a dozen or solid friends who I talk to or work with on the regular. They came from club involvement, within my major, class work, etc. so we have a lot in common. I used to have absolutely nothing to do outside of class with anyone and I spent all my time alone, but now I at least have something to do occasionally with some people, which is good for my mental health, I think.

The problem is I’m a senior and just as I’m starting to feel much better about my social life and connections, it’s almost over. That’s become the new disappointment. I can’t help but look back and wish things had gone differently, even though I wasn’t that kind of person back then. I wish I had started at main campus, lived in the dorms, bonded with people, etc. I never had those experiences and now that I’ve had sort of a taste of a healthier social life (for me) here, I’m having retroactive FOMO. Now I wish I could spend more time here because I’ve started to really enjoy it, but I graduate in just a few months and then it all falls apart again. I do well making connections in forced environments, but I struggle making connections in all the freer parts of life where everyone is doing different things. I’m still very introverted, but I’m not totally satisfied with that like some are. But I don’t know if that’s really what I feel or if I’m just blindly jealous of those who seem to be living it up 24/7. Is that real life? There seem to be super social people who already have their huge, established circles, and then people who are just uninterested in connecting with others at all. Even now, sometimes when I try to make conversation with people, it seems like many are just miserable and uninterested. The number of people I notice going about their days on campus silently with dreadful looks on their faces is high. It depresses me.

So, to summarize: I’m feeling disappointed again because after a lot of time and effort spent creating real friendships, I’ll be graduating soon and then it’ll be all over and I’ll feel completely alone again. I understand that you just have to keep making friends wherever you go, wherever you work, but it’s just so hard and draining for me. I’m having retroactive FOMO because I never had the experiences of living on campus and being close with people and it seems like those experiences are fun and important. If anyone else has ever felt the same type of thing, or has any input to offer, please share :)",dap2s5,PennStateUniversity

[Dorms] Replace Mattress? Too soft,4,4,"I just slept in the mattress they gave for a dorm in Cambridge Community. But the mattress seems low quality and too soft. A soft mattress allows the lumbar spine (aka lowerback) to sink, and this is terrible for posture and leads me to wake up with a stiff back.

First Semester at UMD,56,23,"**EDIT: Hi! I would like to add resources for anyone else who finds this post and has experienced** ***anything*** **similar to me. Resources that people have referred me to and I have found myself can be listed below :)!!! I do not want this post to be me whining about my life so I feel like I should raise awareness if anyone else is going through the same things I have.**

I am a first-year student at the University of Maryland and this was my first semester in college. It sucked.

Initially moving in, I was excited - *very,* *very* scared, but excited. :) I did not know how **anything** would turn out, I just wanted to finally enjoy life & learn how to be an adult. In high school, I had a 4.67 GPA and was in the top five of my class. Never partied, had one long-term boyfriend, the only drug I ever had was weed, and I didn't even hold a boy's hand until senior year. Such a prude haha.

So I came to UMD and partied. Made new friends. Hooked up. Browsed Tinder. Got a tattoo impulsively. I felt like as an adult, I had to prove it (by acting recklessly, I guess).

But I also passed out in a local food joint from laced weed. I fell into my first depressive episode. I got raped at a party. Someone tried kidnapping me on my way to my dorm. I was constantly sick from mold exposure. My anxiety has gone up tenfold and I fear that people close to me will kill me - but it can't even be called ""fear"" because I've accepted that it might happen. I've grown delusional. I can't enjoy sex, I freeze and tense up now. I feel powerless over my life. My boyfriend blamed me for my rape and called it cheating.

I think I deserve everything that has happened to me this semester and I know I shouldn't. And I think the worst part of it all is that I have just learned to adapt. I can't even tell a therapist about what I am going through. It feels like everything is happening as a lesson and not because people took advantage of me and made me feel dumb. But knowing this all happened during my **first** semester, I am scared about what will happen next semester and the semester after that and so on and so forth. Instead of dreading finals week, I am over the moon excited to leave this hellscape and focus on myself.

Thank you UMD for the freshman year memories.

Right now I plan to dorm in Flexus but still stay in the scholars program and wonder if anyone here has done that.

Another problem is that I can only go to the scholars orientation because I am not here when the Flexus orientation happens. Will that be an issue if I decide to choose Flexus?

Stupid football game cancelled buses,58,20,"Edit: Fixed DOTS username

I'm writing this as I am walking to Kung Fu Tea from North Campus in the dark during rain, because this dumb game has, for some reason, cancelled/redirected all buses (including WMATA Metrobus) on campus (except the 104 Metro Shuttle-UM). Who thought that the best way to handle a large crowd on campus is to cut off almost all of the mass transit?

And what about us students? We're the ones who pay tens of thousands of dollars to be on this campus. But thanks to the sport where people can watch students get permanent neurological damage (football sure is cool, right?), we can't even have the Grocery Shopping Shuttle running on the ONLY day that it runs to go get groceries? And, we can't even have buses to the stores and restaurants on Route 1 either? What are we supposed to do, stay shut in our dorms all day?

How about off-campus students? Such as those who live in the houses, Courtyards, Varsity, View, Enclave, MGM, etc??? They have no way to get to stores or campus? What if they have a meeting, interview, work, group project, or other events that require them to come to campus? Or, what if they want to go work out at Eppley/Richie? They're paying for it as part of their tuition too.

Not sure if this is a DOTS decision, or if it's a directive from a higher-up. However, it is definitely apparent that the leadership of this school prioritizes football, and many other things, over the students who actually attend here. This is absolutely ridiculous, and needs to change. Regardless of who wins the football game, the students always lose here.

I already know I can sublet the rooms, but this is not guaranteed. Are there any other costs other than on campus housing on my UMD tuition bill that will be eliminated for next year?

For anyone who's feeling alone tonight,117,16,"Hi terps,

I'm an incoming senior who is writing this post for any freshmen (really anybody, but it's targeted toward freshmen) who are feeling sad tonight because they haven't made many or any friends. This is the story of my time through college. It obviously won't be entirely relevant to anybody but maybe it will be helpful.

---

I came to UMD out-of-state. I had a couple friends from home come here as well, but I didn't know anyone else. When I got to school, I was excited to meet new people. When it actually came to talking to people, I was shy.

The first night I made plans to go out with one of my friends from home, and the friends he made. He ended up screwing me over because he was worried that I would hurt the ""ratio"" (of guys to girls) and we wouldn't be let into a party (we're now good friends again).

That night I was pretty bummed and just hung out with another one of my friends from home in our dorm. The next night the same thing happened, and around 11, I said, ""screw it, let's just go find parties"". We had no idea where to go, and thought there were parties at Fraternity Row, so we went there. Heads up: there aren't parties at Fraternity Row.

We were really bummed we couldn't find any parties, and eventually realized the parties were in Old Town. We walked around and saw people going into parties but didn't have the confidence to try to get into one.

I got back to my dorm room that night and spent a couple hours reading every reddit thread on /r/UMD about going to parties and making friends. I just didn't know what else I could do. I also decided at that moment, that if I was ever in the position to turn someone down at a party, I wouldn't say no.

Anyway, the next few days continued with me making a few friends, but not many. I decided to go to Meet The Greeks, an event where you meet Greek organizations on campus. I went to a couple and introduced myself. I talked to around 8 fraternities and decided to leave. As I was leaving I joked to the friend I went with, ""you know, who knows, maybe the next one I talk to will change my life"". I went to another table, talked to the guys, and left.

Later that night, one of the guys from that last table I talked to sent me a text.

>Hey \_\_\_\_ it's \_\_\_\_ from \_\_\_\_. We're having a party tonight at \_\_\_\_. It's a highlighter party so make sure to wear a plain white shirt and come around 11 with friends and girls if you want too

I was so excited to get invited to a party, but I was nervous because I hadn't been to a college party and it was a Tuesday — I had class the next day! I ended up going. The friend who I walked to Old Town with and I took the green bus (and learned how the busses worked). As we were walking toward the party, some guys were walking toward us. ""There's no point in trying to go, they're not letting any more guys in"". I was discouraged but thought, I made it this far, I'm at least going to try. I walked up to the house, and sure enough, the guys at the door told me sorry, the house is too packed. I started walking away, disappointed.

But then someone came out the door and yelled, ""Hey, you guys can actually come in"". Excited, we entered the party.

---

I ended up joining that fraternity. I met most of my close friends through it. I've lived with members of it every year since. Last year I joined the executive board. All because one guy came out at the right time and gave us a shot.

I can now say that I've made a lot of close friends in college, and that I've had a good experience so far. I'm excited for my senior year. I'm not what you think of when you think of a guy in a fraternity. I think fraternity guys have a stereotype for being douchebags. Just like everywhere, yes, there are douchebags, but most of guys in fraternities are genuine and nice.

Remember when I mentioned the pledge I made to myself that if I was ever in the position to turn someone down at a party, I wouldn't say no? I kept that pledge. And I get a lot of shit for it. Every semester I see myself in a group of guys who come up to our house during a party, trying to get in. When I'm at the door, I invite them in. I think it's douchey to require a ratio.

Now I'm off to go to a rush party. Tonight I'll be helping manage the health & safety operation — making sure everyone is safe. Part of that is being at the door. If I see you, you're welcome to come in.

A lot of things in my story were pretty lucky. And maybe a fraternity isn't for you. You don't need to want to party. Whether it's through a fraternity, a club, talking to a classmate, or even just seeing someone eating alone, what I hope you get out of this is that, if you put yourself out there, you will make friends. This isn't only true for freshmen. You may be feeling down tonight, but you have plenty of time to turn things around.

&#x200B;

I'm a first year that moved from somewhere else in BC. Currently I live in one of the old Totem Park houses. My experience with residence at UBC so far has been terrible, especially considering the amount of money that I've paid. I'm only a week in, and I hope to god it gets better because I'm going to be spending the rest of the year here.

First, let's talk about the meal plan for first years. This is a well-known topic but the meal plan is a money-grubbing monopoly at best and a downright scam at worst. I went to FEAST at totem the other day and tried to buy a yogurt parfait that was about half the height of my hand. It was $6.50. My high school cafetaria had a bigger yogurt parfait with more toppings at $2.

Not to mention the amount of food you get. You ever go to Orchard's open kitchen and order the Kung Pao or Chicken and they give you one of these bowls that's not even 1/4th full? It's $10 worth of food that's meant to feed hungry teenagers, many of which could be athletes, or frequently walking/studying. I consider myself on the smaller side in terms of weight/height and it barely keeps me full.

The entire payment scheme is disgusting. Residence dining halls like to advertise saying that you get a 25% discount off the regular price which is true, but you literally pay for that discount. It's called ""residence overhead"" and you pay $1,000 for the year. Discount my ass, what kind of discount makes you pay for the discount ahead of time? Oh, and you lose that discount if you don't spend it at your dining hall. The discount you already paid for in advance. I was making some small talk with one of the guys at the office in FEAST and when I mentioned this he just shrugged and said ""I don't make the decisions."" Even the staff know it's terrible.

The UBC website says that first years pay $5500 for the meal plan. That's for around seven months of eating assuming you move out for winter break. That's $785 a MONTH. Do you think teenagers fresh out of high school can feasibly afford that? It doesn't matter through, UBC gets off on the government's dime.

And the worst part? It's not even nutritious. The Pork Mannoush at feast has something like 2400mg's of sodium and that's only one meal. Pretty much everything worthwhile on a cost/calorie basis is fried and soaked in fat. You can go to the salad or fruit bar but in terms of calories its pretty much impossible to get enough energy to function on a daily basis, eat healthy AND not run out of meal plan money at the same time.

It's sad that Domino's Pizza is the best deal for food in terms of meal plan. You know what makes it even worse? Domino's isn't even in campus. Out of all the eateries, the most cost-effective option is a pizza delivery from Vancouver. Seriously?

This scam is mandatory for first years. 18-year olds who barely have any sort of financial resources. Sure you can be reasonably middle class or well off and expect your parents to pay for it. But what about the kids without those sort of resources? Take out a loan or starve. You can look at pretty much any other post-secondary institution in Canada and they have it better. This is a frequent complaint too. A year or two back there was a petition on [change.org](https://change.org) with somewhere around a thousand signatures and they did jack shit. In fact, they upped the prices.

Not to mention the wi-fi. The wi-fi at my dorm is absolutely terrible. Speedtest has it average at like 2-3 mbits download and 3-4 mbits upload. I can't do coursework in my dorm since the connection goes on-off-on-off like the lights at a drunk frat party. I'm paying something like $10,000 to live here for seven months, is decent wi-fi too much to ask? I'm not wanting to stream 1080P blu-rays or anything, just let me watch my goddamn math prelectures on youtube without jizzing out.

And the cherry on top? They make you pay for laundry. By god, haven't you made enough money off of us? At least let us do the bloody laundry for free. And the driers suck shit too. It took me five dries the first time I did laundry to actually get my clothes to a reasonable moisture-free level. And it was still fucking damp. It cost me $10 to do one load of laundry.

I went to the first-year pep rally and they were talking about how this is the school of the future that's incorporating technology into the curriculum. Technology my ass I'd rather go study in cambodia if it means I get decent wifi.

I wish I was somewhere else,55,10,"TW familial abuse, trauma, mental illness, suicide

I hate my body. Its made so many mistakes. I grew up in a difficult place, a lot of things were taught to me, beaten into me, toxic, limiting, structurally abusive things that I internalized so deeply I didn't realize until I sat in a lecture hall and learnt theories about them. Theory. It is a strange, sobering thing to take notes on pain you've felt your entire life - to have something you've felt so often and so intensely its become a part of you to be reduced to clinical, time efficient lecture slides. I've internalized my worthlessness. I didn't know better. I've lived so mindlessly all my life - university was supposed to be my way out. But I was so naive. I didn't take time off after high school even though I wanted to. I can't tell you why because I don't know. I did what I was told.

But I understand some things now. I understand why my first year I kept having breakdowns where I would shake, cry, try not to scream because it felt like my body wasn't mine and I wasn't meant to be here. I understand why I spent mornings, days, months (?) weak and withering in a bed, hurt, avoidant of so many beautiful opportunities because of a grave, weighted lethargy. I understand why I was provoked by the sunlight outside my dorm's window, a truly beautiful one in retrospect, and envisioned myself too often hanging from the nameless tree by it, sometimes idly. I understand why I was okay with emailing professors, asking for deadlines, and casually mentioning constant panic attacks, self neglect, and dissociation. I understand why I only went to counselling after the prof told me that he didn't want to see my essay, but proof that I was getting help. I understand why it is so easy for me to beat myself up for a mediocre grade while immediately dismissing a hard earned 90 as fraudulent. My therapist used the word trauma and I - an individual that has prided herself all her life on her knowledge of things, after all what else could I have been made for - did not know what it meant, what it meant to me. She told me I was a person worthy of care, love, and time. I asked her why she was lying.

I've been in Canada for a year now. It is such a place between places; very much a space of self-creation.  Diasporic identity is a formless, unstable, ugly road, requires intense effort and sacrifice. For that kind of will, you need worth. I was never taught how to value myself. I've internalized and normalized so much abuse. Harm. I'm crippled by memory. This summer I went back to my home country. I had new eyes, and the curse of knowledge. Familiarity mutated before me and I saw cultures for what they were. Seething power disparity, injustice, cycles of misogyny, violence, you name it. I understood why I had been treated how I had my entire life -- by virtue of my being. Woman, outspoken. Woman, mentally ill. It was a painful experience, recognizing that the chains I thought were a part of me were actually put on me. I tried to make peace, reconcile. To mutually unlearn. I also realized I wanted a break. I rushed into university, I fucked up my degree planning, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I still don't. So I decided to take a year off so I could recalibrate. Does that even make sense? Maybe transfer out. I just wanted time to breathe, take care of my mental health. I had work opportunities lined up, I had good friends to support me. It was a difficult, pained decision to make and I was assured of my autonomy. So, at immense loss, I made it. I was going to paint the walls in my room. But then my family, all Western-educated and self proclaiming liberals, said -- ""you will be a burden here. You will ruin your life. You will be nothing here but an unqualified pretty rich girl and you know what happens to those. You did this to yourself. You've constructed a narrative where everyone is against you.""  My father, Americanized to the bone. ""You will never work. You will be menial."" He threatened to marry me off. Then they said, ""It is only your choice. Do what you want.""

I was beaten this summer. My mother and my younger brother beat me with their bare hands, on the floor of my room, my space, my home. My bookshelves and writing on the walls. I was having a breakdown and asked to be taken to a hospital so I wouldn't hurt myself. They closed the windows so the neighbours couldn't my screaming and then beat me. The choice I made peace with shattered. My sense of safety and security in my body shattered. I don't remember getting on a plane and crossing the ocean by myself but I did. Because how can a person take that? Continue living after that kind of treatment? How does a person find the will to live and work when they have been treated less than human? By no means was this new treatment for but for the first time in my life, I knew it was purely unjust, incompatible with truth. it was /wrong/.

I'm a second year now, I have to declare my majors soon. I can't fathom not reaching my goals; the only other scenario is lifelessness, the end of my soul. I am going back to my home city the day of my last final. I am working on my boundaries and am so excited to see my grandfather, my dada, and my friends. But I don't see myself reaching tomorrow. I don't feel safe anywhere. I've always felt so displaced, naturally, in coming so far across the world, but now it's more violent. I moved into a new place and I still have the boxes in my room. Half-opened, collecting dust. I got rejected or just didn't hear back from every paid job I applied to. I feel so useless. I harmed myself because I should've applied to Co-op. There are so many bills waiting that I can't pay. I am doing either really well or not at all in my classes. I managed to get a psychiatrist here (so so grateful for universal health care, fuck the cost increase) but we never have enough time during our weekly sessions.

There are a few transfer application deadlines tomorrow. In places with sun and cheaper tuition. I won't have the grades to get in though. But sickeningly, I want to try. I do have a good life here though, beautiful friends, potential for meaningful work. But I fucked up my degree planning. I was getting 90s in all my essays for my Arts One last year (an 18 credit program) but my mental health took a turn as the year ended and I just didn't submit any more work. So I got Standing Deferred and the summer to do my work. The summer was unkind and my family did things to me. I tried to die. Nothing worked out and I couldn't get the work done. It sounds so stupid writing that out because I had so much time but my body couldn't get the work done. I got a C-. It was my first mark below 80 my entire life and it could have been easily avoided. its destroyed my future. When I cry about this, I always laugh. 

 I may be here a lot longer than 4 years. It's a nauseating thought because of the intense financial strain. I made so many mistakes. I can't go back to study in my home country because I was raised in an English speaking system and there aren't any good humanities programs there. I did this to myself. I was on track to be an Honours student and now here I am. I can barely feed myself, shower, sleep properly, function. I feel decaying. I am so stuck, so lost, so constantly hurt. I can't stop thinking about dying. I have a lot of assignments piled up right now, all of them extended, and I still can't function. I feel so weak for being like this after so long. I want to let go of this pain. I have grad school ambitions, I want to teach, I want to make meaningful contributions to this life and my community. I am doing things this year, trying my best, and there is room for growth, maybe lessons for impact. But now I have been forced to reconsider everything I thought I knew about myself. I feel so burnt out and taking time off isn't even an option anymore. I don't know what to do. I see all my peers doing so well, with their jobs and co-op and schedules. I can't do anything. I think about dying too much. I'm on so many medications. The Crisis Line knows me well. 

I just want to be free of all this weight and deep rooted pain so I can focus on what needs to be focused on. I just want to move forward. I want to succeed. I considered academia my calling my entire life; I had the grades and passion for it - it's also a family tradition - but I am realizing now more than ever that perhaps my body simply isn't fit for it anymore. What hurts most is that I don't think it's my fault.

 It's such a painful truth to even write out. What am I then? How else will I have worth? I can't think of anything. I don't feel like a person. I want to do a double major. I want to teach. I want to write. I want to do things for my country because I am so privileged to be here and time is running out. I can't do anything. There is nothing left inside me. I don't want to stay alive anymore. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I think I had potential once. I must have. I don't know what happened to it. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know if I want to leave this place or if I should at all. I am so constantly envious. I want to be better than this but I don't know how. I just wish I was somewhere else. I wish I wasn't in this body

I'm sorry for the long as fuck rant, I don't know what else to do. I wish I had guidance on where to turn to. also sorry for any typos, this headspace is uncooperative 

I have 3 papers to do for the weekend and then two on Tuesday and a final on Wednesday. all I've done for the last 4 days is cry. Everything feels so overwhelmingly final. I am a dead end. I saw people graduating today and it really numbed me that the diplomas came in folders that bent. Such great amounts of suffering, hard work, and money for a flimsy ass folder. I don't think I'm capable of that kind of endurance. (solely perhaps for the bouquets) My only tether in life was academia and now I think I've lost the will for it - I've lost the will for everything. Everything hurts so much. There's so much I want to do, but I simply can't close the gap between myself and that ambition. I feel so alone and lost. I can no longer visualize change or even the future. How can there be life after this? I don't want to die but I can't foresee any other alternative

It's a beautiful place to be, UBC. We are so fucking fortunate. But Vancouver feels soulless to me sometimes. Taxing. Albeit quiet and stunning. I grew up in such a loud, violent metropolitan hellhole. The mountains and evergreen here feel like such mockery. This place, while costly, has been very kind to me; loving friends, professors, doctors, partners, nature, the ocean, occasional sun. How can I still be so inadequate and hurting? I have all the resources for success and yet I feel like I do not have any grasp or control over arguably the most key one: what is supposed to be myself",e3r9du,UBC

Just completely paid off student loans - Sharing some lessons learned from my financial journey,43,9,"[https://imgur.com/a/El1dKR2](https://imgur.com/a/El1dKR2)

I'm incredibly excited to share that earlier this year, I made the final payment on my BCOM student loans! Getting ahold of my finances while breaking into my new role as a full-time professional was difficult to navigate, so I wanted to share some tips that I picked up along the way so that hopefully, your journey to be free of student debt will be smoother & shorter than mine:

Some context on my personal/financial background: I come from a 1st generation immigrant working class family with no personal / family friend connections to my current career (Technology and management consulting). I worked full time for a few years between high school and UBC that allowed me to gather some life savings before starting at UBC. After savings from summer internships, P/T work in the regular semesters, random minor bursaries (Addressed later), I graduated with about \~$27K in debt. Starting salary w was $70K Pre-Tax salary + $5K signing bonus. Debt was paid off in about 19 months of postgrad work.

**Don't leave money on the table if your employer offers matching programs**

* My initial strategy was to aggressively focus all income not committed to living necessities to get me off the awful, awful, awful compound interest train. It wasn't until after I paid off my debt when I began to explore the full scope of my employer's benefits, which in fact included a pretty generous DPSP+RRSP contribution matching scheme. The rate of returns *actually ended up beating the interest rate on my student loans* \- This meant that I left money on the table when a small percentage of my income could've started to work earlier and provide better returns for me.
* Additionally, I completely forgot about factoring annual tax returns while calculating my annual debt burndown - Remembering this would have put me in a better position to take advantage of my employer's matching program.

**Have a high volume, low-effort stance targeting minor bursaries**

* My grades throughout my undergrad were usually at or slightly below class averages. This definitely hurt my eligibility for major scholarships, but there were surprisingly a number of smaller scale bursaries (Think <$1,000 CAD) that were released throughout the year that have a substantially smaller pool of applicants and relaxed standards. At the start of every semester, I would create a few application templates (250 words, 500 words, 1000 words, customizations depending on whether the bursary was related to an applicant's background & life experiences, professional aspirations , community involvement, etc.) and just hot-swap key phrases specific to the application or the organization.  I found a lot of potential leads following LinkedIn's tags like #bursary #student #scholarships and taking a shotgun approach to JUST APPLY APPLY APPLY. I'd commit no more than 30 mins per application, and this approach netted a modest \~$200 - $2,000 a semester.

**You are NOT done investing in your education**

* Mileage may vary by industry & career, but a sad reality in my field is entry-level analysts have ridiculously high burnout/attrition rates. My peers also noticed that their employers & managers hesitate to invest in training for <2 year employees since so many new grads will jump ship for better opportunities, or because we discover that the field isn't good fit.
* Even if you don't have the appetite for a full Masters/MBA program, (I certainly don't for the forseeable future…) This still means that it becomes YOUR responsibility to provision additional external professional certifications & training relevant to you. The feeling of dropping a couple of hundred dollars on a weekend/online course is painful, but in hindsight I should have done it sooner to maximize my ROI… It would have put me in a better position to negotiate raises at the start of each new fiscal year, get noticed by managers for promotion/staffing for cool projects, or switch to a company that offered better total rewards for industry accreditations.

**Quality means something now - Buy nice or buy twice**

* When I relocated for my career to Toronto, I immediately fell back into the student dorm life mindset trap - Outfitting my living space with the cheap appliances & tools thinking that I might have to relocate next year. It was a clear mistake as I've already had to spend more money replacing essentials (A good kitchen knife, snow boots, office clothing, etc.) than a good quality one would've cost up front. This isn't even factoring in time having to go shop for a replacement, or the simple pleasure of owning & using a high quality product.

I want to end on this note: Bullshittery like luck, privilege and timing will have an outsized impact on your journey to financial security. I graduated with students that are undoubtedly more socially savvy, hard-working, and/or intelligent than I am, but experienced less than ideal outcomes from factors beyond their control. (Holy fuck am I counting my lucky stars that I got out before the upcoming recession...) Personally, I can look back on my time at UBC and where I am presently and say wholeheartedly that my cup overfloweth with gratitude. I hope was able to share a modicum of love, knowledge and understanding with this.  <3",d30109,UBC

How to make your first (or second) year at UBC not an absolute shit time but a good one,148,9,"My last post on r/UBC probably isn’t the most comforting thing for first years/new students; I said I’d comment with some advice too but it got so long so here’s a post. Feel free to add on because this is definitely not conclusive.

- Mental health is a priority. Not just something to keep an eye on. Find resources and support even if you’re doing alright if you have a history of mental illness; change such as university can trigger it and either way it’s good to have a safety net. I wrote up a list of resources in Vancouver here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/9a9rdz/some_mental_health_resources_in_and_around/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

- Get in touch with access and diversity asap if you may need it as well. Mental health issues count too. *Most* profs are pretty sympathetic towards students, if you think you’re beginning to struggle, let them know early and they might be able to accommodate you.

- Don’t stress too much about making friends, but also don’t completely isolate yourself. If you live in rez, make friends with your roommate and your floor. If you don’t, get involved with collegiate. Definitely check out AMS clubs but don’t expect to immediately become best friends with someone. It’s consistency that’s key; it’s hard to form a friendship if you only drop by once every few weeks. 

- Also Vancouver as a city has socializing opportunities too. Bars have trivia nights and game nights. Meetups happen. I suggest checking out Stormcrow. 

- Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to make friends, things tend to happen naturally. It’s 100% okay to have periods in life where you don’t have any friends, you’ll get through that. 

- Socializing doesn’t just have to be with peers in class and clubs! I ended up being a regular in a few joints/cafes and am on good terms with people who work there; we chat like friends. 

- On top of that, you really don’t need to be in a relationship. If something good happens, that’s great, but don’t be in a relationship just for the sake of being in one or because everyone else seems to be dating. It’s so much healthier being single and enjoying it versus trying to force things with people you’re not compatible with. Relationships are hard work and I’ve seen them crash and burn for less. 

- Variety is good. I’ve noticed that when I have DIFFERENT things to do - school, part time job, socializing, volunteering, alone time, commute - it stops my brain from lulling right into depression again. Don’t **just** do more, do a wider variety. I think university is more the time to explore rather than specialize despite needing to, yaknow, specialize academically. (Also don’t worry too much about that. So many people end up switching majors and doing just fine, it’s not a permanent decision)

- Your grades will almost definitely be worse than high school, but that doesn’t reflect badly on you! It’s not necessarily a bad thing, honestly. Scaling can be tough. You’re amongst some pretty competitive academic students. First year grades don’t define your life, and you likely haven’t gone down since high school - it’s just that some bars have been raised.

- Learn to love spending time alone! I grew up alone in the house a lot, but it can be jarring to go from living with family 24/7 to essentially by yourself. Explore Vancouver, go to a cafe, check out different food places on your own. It’s uncomfortable to be on your own but will boost your wellness immensely if you get used to and enjoy alone time. Be a tourist in your own city - it’s fun. 

- As per above don’t just stay in the UBC bubble. You can feasibly spend four whole years not leaving campus but don’t do that. There’s so much stuff in the lower mainland to see and be involved in. (If you like live music check out places like the Biltmore Cabaret, the Commodore Ballroom, the Vogue, etc)

- Then again UBC also has good places to go like Nitobe Gardens and the various museums and also a VR lab with drop in hours. Take advantage of all that as well! Your student card will get you either free entry or heavily discounted prices. 

- You don’t have to try everything in first year or feel like you *need* to be a part of university party life from day one or at all. I spent almost all of first year drinking and in people’s dorms and getting home at 4 am; it destroyed my health, and the drinking made my depression exponentially worse. Peer pressure is way more real in university even unconsciously. You don’t have to do everything everyone else is doing. And you have plenty of time in your life to try things. 

- Unless it’s totally necessary don’t buy new textbooks at the UBC bookstore, it’s incredibly expensive. Go on FB’s UBC buy and sell, or get a second hand/used copy from somewhere. There’s also a used textbook store in the village close to Shoppers, but I’ve never been.

- Take advantage of student discounts like Amazon Prime / Spotify / etc.

- Get to know your profs, go to office hours. I regret not doing this that much. It’s excellent to form good relationships with them not just for references but even moreso because profs have a ton of experience and insight and can be really good/interesting people to talk to. My mom’s a professor ironically enough and she always likes chatting with students in office hours - you’re not bothering them, it’s what those hours are for.

- Organization 100000% Start up a diary, bullet journal, online calendar from day one, even earlier if possible. Write down all deadlines as soon as you get a syllabus - even the ones not due until the end of term. Having everything in one place is a huge relief. For the love of god don’t leave everything to last minute, it’s hell. 

- Get a free Naloxone kit from Shoppers or UBC hospital. Even if you don’t party or do drugs at all, it’s always good to have one on hand just in case someone else needs it. You can also find free condoms/safe sex supplies with the SASC I believe.

- If you find a class really difficult, read ahead. Then you can at least have some familiarity, and can concentrate in class on the things you really don’t understand versus just sitting there completely lost still trying to grasp the first slide (me in stats lol)

- Nobody is going to force you to study or chase after you. You can skip all the classes you want to but the consequences are on you. This is the best and worst thing simultaneously. It’s good to hold yourself accountable from the start.

- Let yourself make mistakes and fuck up and fail at things. University feels like the be all end all because of how much that belief is reinforced by parents, teachers, etc. It absolutely isn’t everything. Even if you fail out entirely, your life STILL isn’t ruined. Many of us have over 60 years of life ahead of us. In the long run, things work out. 

- There are way more people than you think who feel exactly how you do. Confused/anxious/lonely, all that jazz from starting a new part of life. People just hide it well. You’re not alone, and you’ll get past the harder obstacles. Once university life is less foreign, you’ll have an easier time too. 

- Everything takes time! There’s a lot of “I only see this person in class and we only do superficial small talk.” It doesn’t mean you won’t or can’t be friends, it just needs time to happen naturally. In high school you see the same people all the time, in university you make that time. 

- Honestly enjoy yourself as much as you can! University isn’t the best or worst time, it’s just what you make of it. Treat yourself often. And yes things do get better!",bgx399,UBC
Taking four courses instead of five?,8,9,"Hey everyone! Sorry for the long post, but everyone's advice is welcome :) I took a term off and am getting everything ready to return in September. I'm still a first year student and have only completed one full term. I'm trying to tweak my situation a bit so it doesn't end in the same sort of catastrophe it did when I left.

I live off campus, about 1.5-2 hours away, with my grandparents (not the greatest environment but I'd rather avoid debt from dorms). We found out my mom was terminally ill around the time I was moving in with them, and that sort of threw me off. I ended up having a late withdrawal from one of my five courses because I couldn't keep up with everything going on. My average was \~73% and I'm hoping to do CS so that has to change.

I know everybody's experience is different so nobody can give the perfect answer for me, but those of you which have originally done five and downgraded to four, did it end up okay for you? Also, is it reasonable to finish a Bachelor's in 5-6 years rather than the usual four? It's already going to take me at least five years, would another be too much if I decided to take things even slower?

[OPINION] Housing Living Standards,25,17,"[Current Apartment. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/mn4lXQZ)

Hello, I just wanted to voice my concern and ask if this living standard is actually OK.
I’ve just moved into dorms less than a week ago, and when I moved in, me and the friend that helped out were so shocked to see the apartment. When we entered, there was an awful smell (still have) and I couldn’t stay any longer there. The floor was REALLY dirty, and what amazes me that this apartment is a shared four bedroom with 3 other GIRLS! 
I’ve been thinking the whole time, is this common? How can people live in such a mess? I’m really uncomfortable to the point that I have to shower EVERYDAY at my friend’s place because there is blood inside the box and a spider living there! I was always taught to clean up my own mess and to not bother other people or making them feel uncomfy, but also, I always lived in a clean place because this is what my parents taught me! 
Since I’ve arrived, I’ve been eating out everyday, spending way more money because I don’t have a place to cook, I’m not even home except for sleep. Since I’ve arrived, I didn’t touch ANYTHING except for the bathroom. I still haven’t unpacked my boxes and luggage in hope of getting moved out ASAP. 
I’ve applied for a room transfer and emailed RLM, but I’m getting anxious because I have an incoming midterm in exactly 1 week. And RLM is taking so long to reply me even thought I’ve walked to the office and talked very briefly about my situation. I am also feeling the whole situation is unfair because I am paying so much for food, room transfer fee, for a bedroom that I only go back to sleep and a place that I never used.

EDIT: Hey guys, thank you for hearing me out! After a few days they transferred me to another apartment, and my roomies are so much nicer and they welcomed me  very well! I appreciated reading your comments and followed some tips and I’m glad that it worked. ",agljwc,UBC
Tips for How to Deal with Loneliness on Campus,19,18,"Although maybe contrary to the title, I do feel I should acknowledge that I do have friends in my program and I am grateful for them, in case they see this post and realize who I am. 

Now for the substance of the post. I am in my second year now and I have found that I am constantly trying to combat feelings of loneliness by immersing myself in my readings, webwork, studying, etc. However, it is getting me nowhere and regardless of if I am studying in a library, coffee shop, the Nest, my dorm, etc. that I continue to feel lonely. At the end of the day, even if I surround myself with other people, I am not interacting with anyone. I feel invisible on this campus. 

My friends that I mentioned before all live off campus. At the end of our classes, I can see everyone else's faces light up because they get to go home and I feel like it's some cruel joke that they can be so happy at a time that I am dreading the upcoming loneliness. The only thing keeping me going right now are the 5-7 hours of classes everyday of the week when I can feel like I am actually alive and not just some sentient, mobile computer. 

They say people whose family member have depression are more likely to have depression at some point too. Is this just life that you don't see people for the majority of your day now and I can't cope or like what can I do?

Important safety PSA,340,24,"I’m not sure if this is allowed here but I need to tell my story. For reference I’m a fifth year female student, I’m not looking for anything out of this except maybe some valid advice and a warning to others. In March of this year I was running around campus at 8 pm. I was dumb and decided to run around totem on marine drive although I had done it previously many times with no issue. Due to a leg cramp I had to start walking as opposed to my usual running. As I was getting close to agronomy road (where the bus stop is and that Forrest part which is dark) I suddenly felt hands at my waist behind me. Those hands processed to move up to my breasts and suddenly grab my tight and constrict me. I still had headphones in at this point and couldn’t hear if he was saying anything. He started to try and pull me towards to Forrest area and that’s when I started screaming. Honestly probably sounded like I was being stabbed but it worked and he loosened his grip. I stumbled away and somehow make it west mall where a security post was, still screaming and crying. No one around asked if I was okay. I called a friend who talked me down while I got back to my dorm room. I called campus security who told me to phone 911. I gave my statement which was good but rcmp never called back to check on me or with any follow up or even put out a warning. Campus security didn’t even put out a warning which is why I’m writing this. The next day I was looking at CBC news and the guy who attacked me’s mugshot was starring at me (i did turn around and got a look at his face before running away btw). Turns out later that night he had stabbed someone at a party. I felt sick, he had a weapon on him and could have done worse than what I thought he was going to do. I’m sorry this is long. I’m sorry I didn’t share this sooner but I’m still traumatized this happened. I’m sorry that campus security and rcmp didn’t do anything. Please be safe people, please know that stuff like this happens on campus. Feel free to ask me questions as well

I don't want to try using a router because meh, adding wireless into the mix just leaves one more connection to mess things up.

Nowadays in college campuses, lives are being ruined by women who knowingly falsely accuse a man of rape, normally after regretting having sex with him. UBC is a wonderful institution and we surely don't wanna see innocents being framed, expelled, prosecuted, jailed and having their reputations tarnished without any proofs. Does anyone know what UBC is currently doing to safeguard young men from these treats and help prosecute unfounded accusations?

In dorms, all I see are a bunch of posters with the good intention of educating those who support nonconsensual sex. With that being said, during my time at UBC, I haven't met a single person who supports nonconsensual intercourse. And I highly doubt that if there is one, two things: That person doesn't know the immorality of their defense and will simply change their mind after having read posters.  On the other hand, I see the general paranoia developing because of such campaigns, where many girls fear sleeping even with their boyfriends who they have trust in everything else. Aside from virtue signaling are there any other gains from putting those up?  Wouldn't the resources spent on the sexual assault office be better invested in funding students who otherwise would be drowning in debt?

How Do Breaks and Dorms Work?,1,1,"Hi, I'm an incoming first-year and I am going to write my two-week notice for my current summer job. I don't want to quit the job, I just want to take a break for school and then work again during the winter break. However, I'm not sure which dates to put I'm available for the winter break. I noticed on the [Academic Calendar for 2019-2020](https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/calendars/calendars-deadlines/academic-calendars/academic-calendar-for-2019-2020) that the Fall Quarter ends December 13 and Winter Quarter begins January 6.

My question(s) is do we move out of the dorms for winter break and move back in **before, after, or on** January 6? Or do we not ""move out"" and simply go home on December 13 and return **by** **January 6?**

I'm essentially free all of Winter Break, so I'd like some suggestions as to which dates to put down in my two-week notice letter. Sorry if this is an odd question but I'm lowkey confused right now haha.

Would you prefer to have a windowless single dorm room or a double with a window?,17,12,"Charlie Munger was interviewed for a recent WSJ article (https://www.wsj.com/articles/buffett-partner-charlie-munger-has-a-side-gig-designing-college-dorms-11556807102?mod=hp_featst_pos3) but I'll quote the UCSB part of the article: 

> After committing an initial $200 million to improving undergraduate housing at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Mr. Munger has spent much of the past few years designing a dorm for the school.

> Mr. Munger’s proposal includes suites of eight single bedrooms alongside large common spaces. Most bedrooms would have artificial windows patterned after the portholes on Disney cruise ships, with customized lighting to mimic daylight.

> The building still has to pass various approvals. Mr. Munger is confident that students would rather have single rooms than bedroom windows.

> “The minute I saw that, I realized that was the correct solution. And everything I thought before is massively stupid,” he says.

> He predicts that when this dorm and his future housing projects at UC Santa Barbara are completed, “it will be widely regarded as the best in the world.” He invokes Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt: “It isn’t that the Jews didn’t get to the Promised Land, it’s just that Moses didn’t get to… That’s OK. This will all come to fruition after I’m dead.”

> He lets out a dry laugh: “Now, I’m not going to try to die early just so that’ll happen, but I’m OK with it if it does.”

"How do I make FRIENDS in college, not just acquaintances I introduced myself to once and never hung out with again?",58,35,"I just finished moving into SanCat (by the way, do we write it like that or like ""San Cat""?) an hour ago. The people here have been really nice and my roommate seems like a super cool guy, but I know I want to get to know tons of people and have a large group of friends. It's something I didn't have so much in high school.

I know the answer to my title is probably, ""Attend events for your interests, and there you'll find those who will be interested in each other."" And I'm 100% ready to do just that. But I don't want to miss out on bonding that happens even before those club meetings/concerts/etc. So when I introduce myself to the people around me, do I let it go and see if we continue to meet naturally? And if not, assuming I like this person/group and want to make sure we hang out again, how do I make that happen? (ESPECIALLY without seeming desperate or over-eager.

F****CK the post office system for the who live in Univ. housing!

I’ve never had a year where my shit has been sent back because I can’t put a PO BOX in on a website. Sometimes I’ll even put my dorm/apt. number + address AND my PO BOX just as a fail-safe —- BUT IT STILL GETS SENT ALL THE WAY BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL DESTINATION. 
It’s always up in the air whether or not I receive my package and I HATE IT!

WHY, WHYYYYY IS THE MAIL SYSTEM JUST NOT CENTRALIZED TO ONE PLACE? WHYYYY does far-side have to pick up their mail only between 4PM-8PM? I’m a full-time student working full-time along with 3 other people who are doing just the same? What if we can’t make that time-gap throughout the week because our schedule doesn’t allow it?

I usually wouldn’t make a post like this, but I ordered some parts for my means of transportation that has been out of commission. Now I have to wait a whole other week to get in contact with the retailer because no one local here sells the parts. UGH

**EDIT:** The 3-strike system is so FLAWED also. As someone previously mentioned in the comments, some retailers and sites won’t even allow you to type “PO BOX” in the address option and you’ll have to use your dorm or apt.number.

You get a WARNING the first time your package isn’t addressed to the PO BOX. And then two more strikes after that. THEN , they’ll just start sending your packages back to sender! 

like TF is that shit. Y’all have my package in hand, YOU KNOW that I’m here at UCSB, but instead of contacting me you’ll return to sender. ok imig",dd1qr7,UCSantaBarbara

"Sexual Assault and the 1 in 5 ""Statistic""",25,5,"We all went through Gaucho FYI, we've all seen the posters in the dorms talking about how 1 in 5 of us will be sexually assaulted in college. But that's a lot of women. Over 2,000 at UCSB alone. This in an epidemic, if it's true. 


But the number they reference is patently poor statistics, determined by an advocacy study (look up the term), and it's totally shameful that a ""world-class research university"" would peddle this delusional falsehood, to the expense of the mental health of the young women attending here. If you don't believe me and won't do the research yourself, [take it from Forbes.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/01/27/the-stat-that-1-in-5-college-women-are-sexually-assaulted-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/)


I'm not trying to detract from the recent abhorrent behavior going on here, but instead making the point that SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT NORMAL.

I've always knew that I wanted to study abroad my 3rd year, I'm currently conflicted about going one semester or to stay the whole year. If anyone has ever been in the same situation as me, I would love to hear about your experience!  


I'm a sociology major and I was thinking of either going to England or South Korea to study, but I'm leaning more towards SK at the moment. I'm not too worried about the classes as I heard it's do-able, but if you have any insight about classes abroad please share them. I do have some FOMO about leaving home for so long but I love to travel and think that it'd be good for me to venture out of my comfort zone. Some people have gone home for the winter break between fall semester and spring semester so if I was really homesick I would consider doing that too. So the pro's and con's list I've come up with is:  


Pros to staying a year:  
\-longer time to explore the country   
\-more time to travel to neighboring countries (like Japan!!! my dream)  
\-gives me a chance to build longer friendships!   
\-i heard you get more financial aid for full year as opposed to just a semester? i'm not too sure so pls lmk!  
\-classes aren't too difficult since I heard that the classes are toned down for exchange students   
\-food in SK is very YUM !!   


cons to not stay a year:  
\-homesickness?   
\-living in the dorms??   
\-i hate the cold so winter is going to be brutal

Life Tip,0,47,"So this is a fact that you won't notice right away but anyone older can see instantly. You aren't on a sleep over. What this means is that it's now time for you to act like an adult. You don't live at home anymore but that doesn't mean because you're away from your parents that you need to go party every weekend, get drunk every night, and not take care of yourself. If you're suddenly sick and you don't know why, you need to buy medicine. Is the internet down? Maybe you need to stop relying on a internet that's being used by every student in the dorm and instead should purchase your own internet. You know that dorm room you're staying in? That's not your bedroom but is instead your home. You need to lock the door to your house and bring your keys with you, so why wouldn't you do the same here?  


Do you get what I'm getting at now? A very LARGE majority of you all seem to treat university as if you're home alone while your parents are on vacation. You think it's time to PARTY PARTY!!! But it's not. You're meant to study, you're meant to get a job and start buying things you need. Money on sports games is money you can spend on that new pair of underwear or the shampoo you ran out of three days ago. You could use that money to pay for internet that would not only let you study like you need to, but let you stream without stutter or game without lag. And I don't want to hear all this ""I can't"" bull crap. You may have university which means you have class and you have homework, but that's nothing new from everyone else in the world. Everyone has things in their life that also needs to be done after they work. Be it cleaning, taking care of others, taking care of themselves, or what have you. Just because you have class and homework is not a reason not to work and take care of your responsibilities.  


So I hate to be the one to make this perfectly clear, but University is a place to learn as well as a trial run to being a adult. Time to wake up, notice that, and actually take steps to be a adult and not the child that we keep seeing everywhere we go throughout MSU.

I live off campus and don't really have any MSU friends,9,19,"So I'm a sophomore and during my freshman year I was eager to get out of the dorms because my sister lived off campus and it just seemed cheaper and better than living on campus. I tried to get some people to be my roommate and commit to an apartment but anyone that I would ask didn't want to commit that early on. So I got an apartment by myself. My freshman year I didn't really make a lot of attempts to make friends here because I was focused on school and I had relationships back at home (girlfriend, friends, family). I usually went back home every 2 weeks or had my girlfriend visit to stay the night every 2 weeks (regardless of what I did I got to see my girlfriend every 2 weeks). So I will say it is my fault for not making friends. But I was still content with my life.

&#x200B;

Now that I'm back at MSU and in my new apartment it feels like all I do is go to class and do homework. During the first couple months my girlfriend and I went through a rough patch after she moved into college (GVSU) so at times I felt really alone and really didn't have anyone around for support (luckily the rough patch is over but it still gets lonely out here sometimes). I have a lot of hard classes this semester (CSE 231, MTH 234, and CE 221) so I felt like I couldn't get a job or join a club. I did try to look into different clubs and actually go to some at the beginning but I was either uninterested, too busy with school, or too busy with going home or seeing my girlfriend. I feel like at this point in the semester it's too late to join a club or make new friends. I will say I have some acquaintances that keep me from being a total loner in class but I don't really have a friend group that I have to have fun with on the weekends I'm not going someplace or having my girlfriend over. I feel like my classes right now are messing with me the most because CSE takes up your entire life during the end of the weekdays and your entire weekend. Also calc and statics just add on to the workload. 

&#x200B;

I will try to next semester hang out with my acquaintances but living off campus means that it's a little hike to get to them or have them get to you and I don't know if they'll go through the effort of hanging out at my place. I don't live that far off campus but it's still a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest free bus stop. I will also try to get into a club but the only club that really interested me was the Smash Bros. Ultimate club and I am a total noob at the game and just get squashed. I don't dislike the club but I feel like they weren't very truthful when they said its a club for beginners to advanced. It feels like everyone there is a pro and I just get destroyed. I just don't know how to make friends. I'm not really one to go to parties but I'm not opposed to just hanging out with a group of people just chatting or playing video games. I tried researching clubs here on a website but nothing really excites me or makes me eager to go to them. I feel like when they say stuff along the lines of ""college is the best years of your life,"" it just doesn't apply to me or that they're already passing by. I'm jealous of my friends that are still back home and my girlfriend for making friends so easily.

Pets: Has anyone attempted to keep a ball python in dorms?,0,14,"So UCSD only lets us keep fish in a 10 gallon tank, which is ALREADY too small for even 1 goldfish.

And instead of fish it was a small ball python? If an official came in and saw, I think it'd be easy to tell them that the tank was empty and I was keeping it for an off-campus friend after their pet died, since snakes like hiding and I've been told it's like keeping a living pet rock.

Yay or nay? Has anyone ever done something similar?

Prejudice against Chinese international students at UCSD,11,67,"Hi, everyone! I'm writing this because I feel concerned about what I see as an unfair prejudice some of us American students harbor. Specifically, I think there are uninformed and unkind stereotypes about Chinese international students that as UCSD students, that we should challenge. One of the common stereotypes I see is that Chinese international students only associate with other international students, and don't adjust to U.S. culture. My response to that is, of course that's how some of them act! They are far away from home in an unfamiliar and difficult school, which (as is often mentioned in this subreddit) is not always the most welcoming place. If as English-primary-language people born and raised in the U.S., we were dropped feet-first into the University of Shanghai, we would probably act in a really similar way. I think Chinese international students deserve empathy and understanding for acting differently from the average U.S. student. After all, people are different from each other, and all have their own challenges. That doesn't mean they stop being people.

I think many of us would feel differently about the stereotypes we hear and repeat if we were to actually have a good conversation with our Chinese peers. I confess that I believed some of these stereotypes in the past. But after connecting as people and having conversations about grocery shopping, or the dorms, or shared experiences with classes, my opinion changed because I saw that Chinese international students are just students like us, but from a different place and set of challenges. If we find ourselves buying into this prejudice — and that's what it is, prejudice, because we are pre-judging people we often have not met or known personally — then maybe our first response should be to ask ourselves some questions. We can ask ourselves, have we really tried to understand? Do we even try to speak to Chinese international students? Or are we simply being afraid of something unfamiliar? I know that I didn't ask myself these questions for a long time, and believed mean and often inaccurate stereotypes because of it. As students and as growing, learning humans, we owe it to both ourselves and our peers to interrogate these stereotypes.",dzfie3,ucsd

I wrote a guide for people going to SD Hacks this weekend!,49,12,"Hi! My name is Stanley, I’m a 2nd year data science major going to SD Hacks this weekend! I’m also a front end developer for ACM, and I spent the past week writing a [hackathon guide for everyone going](https://medium.com/acmucsd/the-hackathon-handbook-85dfc3dd6b4d).

Here are some extra tips I have for everyone going tommorow!

* Everyone takes the hackathon at a different pace. If you have homework or a midterm, you can budget your time 60% studies / 40% hacking. If you decide to only hack, I suggest getting rest Friday night, and going all out Saturday night into Sunday morning.

* Go to workshops! ACM/IEEE/TSE have great workshops where you can learn about Node.js/IoT/Devops. If you see an ACM booth, feel free to stop by to say hi and play Smash!

* You can go back to your dorm, but it's going to be a struggle to get up and walk back. I suggest bringing a sleeping bag/blankets/pillows

*  You don't have to come at the start of check in, but you can meet some cool sponsors/companies and have a chance to network with them

* You'll have way more caffeine then you need at the hackathon. Be sure to stay healthy by walking around and drinking a lot of water. Don't push yourself if you start feeling sick, there are a bunch of more hackathons across California.


Here's the full guide if you want to read the rest of it: https://medium.com/acmucsd/the-hackathon-handbook-85dfc3dd6b4d. If you have any additional tips, definitely let me know so I can add them!

Until then, I want to know if they even plan on improving the quality of the Wi-Fi, because expanding coverage doesn't necessarily mean better Internet.

The way the staff last year handled team-building activities was basically just putting everyone in the same room and telling us to form a team. However, because all I had was some Java and CSE 11 experience under my belt, I didn't know what I could do with Java alone and all the teams that were formed basically only asked for people with experience in a multitude of other programs and software. After that, all I could do was just go back to my dorm feeling discouraged.

UC Scam Diego - Administration Rant,55,34,"Honestly, I just can't defend this school anymore.

Over-enrollment, lack of allocated resources to students, overburdened staff, both of which is considerably worse than other UCs, lack of just about anything basic other schools on the same damn UC system has from proper food and housing that acknowledges you're a human being, instead of treating you like a fucking animal.

I mean, I could go on, infrastructure, the effing WiFi, and so on.

And for fucking what? What the hell are we getting in return?

I mean seriously, you don't have to go far to see the shit UCSD lacks that other schools in the same system have. We're not seeing the return of these sacrifices. I could understand if we were like, #1 top public school or if the quality of academics were rising and we were allocated more resources, but our rankings haven't increased, and that's being generous.

What the fuck is going on? Now they got this 7th college shit, where obviously the increased amount of GEs would lead to an increased amount of retention thus more $$$.

BUT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS? Why do I have to go through all this bullshit and not see anything in return? Why do I have this dogshit food? Dogshit parking? Dogshit wifi? Dogshit housing? Overburdened classes and TAs MUCH WORSE than other UCs?

All this money coming in, all these sacrifices to get more money, and where the fuck is this going where I have to live like an animal and suffer in this shithole when I see nothing in return?

Seriously, there's nothing. Nothing that doesn't exist in other UCs while they manage to keep an overall quality of life above ours. Even the value of the degree is not to the point where all this makes sense. We don't even have a god damn D1 team and everything is in the shitter. To add insult to injury with this 7th college bullshit they're trying to find more ways to get more money and absolutely no plan of improvements and no transparency whatsoever. We see nothing of it. Students are just taken for granted. We're all goats in a fucking farm for this administration, and I despise the way they see us.

""We are, right now, confident we have complete support of the whole campus..."" -- Khosla, about the 7th college requirements

Look at that condescending tone, that ""these are just fucking animals, who cares what they think"" tone, that take-them-for-granted tone.

When the fuck are the students in this school going to do something about all this shit? At least demand transparency about where the fuck is all the money going would be a fucking start. We're reaching a point that not even the lack of connection between the campus can save these fuckers from students organizing protests against them.",bpmrh5,ucsd

Same for 64 degrees steamed brown rice, there's no price; I assume I can pick brown rice and they'll cook it together with your choice of vegetables/meat into one dish, but can I just order plain brown rice and nothing else?

Optional Questions

Moving out of the dorms? Let's talk about your bike.,185,14,"I'm one of the people tasked to deal with abandoned bikes on campus. TL;DR: please take your bike home with you, donate it to [BikeAthens](https://www.bikeathens.org/give/bikes), or email bike@uga.edu to arrange to have it donated for you. It'll save me a bunch of hassle. 

The bike racks around many of the dorms are absolutely bristling with bikes that clearly never get ridden and would take a lot of effort to get back into riding condition. I understand why people would choose to simply leave them behind when they move out. 

What you may not realize is that after you move out, I need to go around to all the bike racks, put a tag on the bikes that appear to be abandoned (which is most of them by now). Then I have to wait 90 days in the off chance that someone comes back to take their bike away. If a bike that I tagged is still there after 90 days, I cut the lock, write a report for UGAPD, and impound the bike for another 90 days in a secure location. If the owner doesn't come for it, after the second 90 days a court order is prepared, it is signed by a judge, and the property is signed over to a nonprofit (BikeAthens). It's a pain, and you'd save me a lot of trouble if you donated it directly. 

If you actually do want to keep your bike and plan to leave it on campus during the summer, do know that it is at risk of being stolen while you're away. If it appears to be rideable (tires have air, chain isn't rusty, all the parts are there) then I won't likely tag it, but you are way better off taking it back home to keep it safe.

A Fishy Tale,12,9,"Hey, so I checked the megathreads and neither seemed to have anything about school history. My family has a huge history with the UGA, specifically my father. He's told me of various stunts he pulled on campus in the 80's such as faking a dead body in a swimming pool, using golf carts to joust, and setting a water bucket in the door frame trap but replacing the water with fish guts. Now, I took these stories with a grain of salt and put them in the back of my mind for years. I don't think it's really possible to fact check the first two things he did, but I distinctly remember that the fish guts odor was apparently so bad that they had to replace the carpet, and (allegedly) according to his friends, that dorm still smells like dead fish. I remembered this after eating fish tonight and got curious about this rumor. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is if there is a dorm on campus that still smells like fish guts?

Fresh start as a sophomore?,6,6,"Let me just start out by saying that this is by no means a pity post. I messed freshman year up, and I'm taking full responsibility of that fact. I don't expect sympathy because frankly I don't deserve it, I just need some advice with the situation I'm in.

So I had virtually no friends in high school. I've always had problems talking to people, and I always felt like the odd one out, so I let myself believe it and got nowhere. However, I'd spent all of high school believing that everything was going to change in college, that freshman year was going to be a ""fresh start!"" Well, I screwed it up.

The first month and a half or so was alright. I joined Freshley, made a few friends and possibly a new best friend. And then the stress of trying to keep these friends caught up with me. I began hurting myself and slowly going insane, and I eventually lost a lot of my friends as a result. I developed alcoholism, and my depression kept getting worse and worse until I was eventually hospitalized. I hardly left my room, joined virtually no new clubs, struggled with an addiction to drugs and alcohol, and spent a lot of days crying and/or sitting alone in my car. And then I eventually had to drop out because I kept attempting suicide.

So I think it's safe to say that I didn't have the ""freshman experience"" that everyone else had. I had a crappy dorm experience, alienated a lot of my friends, and went insane. I screwed my fresh start up, and I'm worried I'm out of second chances. I'm really hoping to get yet another fresh start -- is there any way I might be able to do that as a sophomore? My grades are fine, I think I have a 3.7 GPA, and I have sufficient mental health resources now, but I'm really worried I'm never going to have a social life now that everyone already has their friend groups pretty much locked in. I'm on Freshley lead this next year and obviously I'll be going to Wesley, but I'm not sure what else I could be doing with my time. I don't know what my interests are anymore, so just general club recommendations and/or tips for getting involved for the first time as a sophomore would be great! Anything that could help me have the freshman experience I didn't get to have. Thanks in advance!",cg8716,UGA

Residence Hall Name and Year of Occupancy:

Sum Up Your Experience In One Word:

Best Attribute of Your Dorm (ie. fun events, lots of space, social):

Worst Attribute of Your Dorm(ie. Bugs, fire drills, isolated):

What Was Your Main Priority When Choosing your Freshman Year Dorm?

1. How was the social atmosphere in your dorm?

2.if you could redo freshman year-would you choose the same dorm? Why or why not?

3. Would you recommend this dorm to upcoming freshmen?

4. Did you befriend a lot of your dorm-mates and was there a strong sense of community in your dorm?

5. Was there a certain ""type"" of person found most commonly in your dorm (ie. Greeks, introverts, atheletes, etc.)?

6. Was your dorm in a convenient location?

7. Did your dorm frequently host events/activities? How popular were they?

8. Best memory made in your dorm and/or craziest experience in dorm?

9.Which of the freshman residence halls would you say is the best and which is the worst? Why?

10.Advice to freshman currently deciding on a residence hall?

11. Which dining hall is, in your opinion, the best?



And last but not least,

12.How important is one's dorm placement in respect to their overall enjoyment, success, and friend group during their freshman year? 



Thanks so much for reading and answering! Your advicd could potentially improve someone's freshman year!


EDIT: Naturally with the size of each incoming freshman class, the chance of one getting their top choice dorm seems to grow less and less likely. However, for those that got EA acceptance or had some other circumstances that will give them greater priority in choosing their dorm, answering the questionnare will still prove to be very helpful. 

EDIT:
Now that I've completed my freshman year, I just wanted to come back and answer some of my own questions from a year ago!

-Creswell, 2016-2017
-Claustrophobic. 
-Got to meet some really cool people, made a lot of connections!
- WE HAD ALMOST 20 FIRE DRILLS(Actually I'm pretty sure it was more) ALL AT THE HOURS OF 2-4 am. SOME DURING FINALS/MIDTERM WEEK. We were all ready to actually burn the building down. Also, others on your hall can be REALLY inconsiderate. Depends on who you get(could be lucky, could be horribly unlucky)
-Meeting new people/finding community 

1. SO, as someone who wasn't super popular in high school and has always avoided drugs/alcohol/parties, I wanted the ""lively party dorm"" experience so that I could branch out. I can say that I definitely got to experience some wild parties. HOWEVER, Creswell was full of very stereotypical Greek kids who were pretty exclusive, and girls are my hall were also pretty closed off towards each other(the 'open door policy' was not a thing for us). It was the friends I ended up with, not the dorm that made my social life.

2. Looking back on these questions, they're actually kind of hard to answer. I made mistakes, met awesome people, and made incredible memories in Creswell. I wouldn't change them for anything, but that's not to say that I wouldn't have had an equally good experience in another dorm. I'd still say no though, I'd stick with Creswell.

3. Yes! You'll have a definite love-hate relationship with it, but my #1 tip is FIND YOUR COMMUNITY. Creswell, ironically, can feel incredibly lonely at first when your parents drop you off and you realize that you really have to fend for yourself now. A lot of people will stick with their high school friend group or rush(I didn't) at first, so there's a chance you might feel a little on your own for a while. Talk to people on your wing, if you don't like them, try another wing, then another floor. Sit with random people, strike up conversations wherever you can, join ORGANIZATIONS for something that you're passionate about. You'll feel motivated, uplifted, and enjoy college way more once you have friends to do it with(and you will make friends! It takes some longer than others, don't feel discouraged if it doesn't happen immediately)

4. Creswell is like 900+ people, so I'll speak for my hall. No, we were very closed off. We were all just very different people, not a lot of the same interests and involved with different groups on campus. Girls on an adjacent wing though, were awesome! I loved them a lot and wished I got put on a more social wing.

5. Preppy Greeks, mostly white, mostly North Atlanta

6. YES, Creswell is the only high rise I would live in bc of this. The lack of extra hill is wonderful.

7. Yes, and no. Everyone is too busy to go to the RA events, unless they have food.

8. The usual stories of people puking in stairwells, hallways, etc. Some guys took an entire Christmas tree and put it in a bathroom stall for no apparent reason. Multiple friends waking up to their roommates having sex with strangers in their room(don't do this people.). Drinking in dorm/doing drugs is pretty common, despite what the rules say. It's pretty much impossible to monitor 900+ people, and a lot of RAs don't care(some try to be second parents, it's luck of the draw)

9. BEST- Creswell or Lipscomb. Amazing location, which really matters. WORST- Brumby. Social atmosphere is equal to Creswell, don't listen to the Brumby supporters(Brumby alumni secretly want others to suffer as they did. Don't fall for their recommendations. THAT HILL IS THE WORST.)

10. Lowrises- few connections, dorm is generally more like a ""family"" where you know most people by name. Kids to hang out in the lobbies(no front desk unless you live in Hill), so it kind of has that ""unsupervised sleepover"" vibe. Crazy stuff went down in the lowrises, don't just think it's limited to the high rises. Also, they have SINKS IN ROOM(enormous perk), bigger rooms, and they're actually cheaper than the high rises. Lipscomb and Mell have the best overall location. Church/Boggs are good for science majors.

High rises- Lots of connections, Not family like at all. It has a ""big city"" vibe. It's made up of plenty of exclusive friend groups and cliques(and Greeks), but you won't feel like the dorm as a whole is close knit. HOWEVER, you can get lucky and end up with an awesome hall. Just consider the main demographic of people who live in the high rises, and think of the likelihood that you'll end up with people you like based on that demographic. People tend to crash here and go out, stumbling back in very intoxicated super late. 

11. Other than the Niche, which obviously wins, ECV is second best. The quality of everything is just so much better.

12. Don't overthink it like I did!! Go with your gut, and if it turns out your gut led you astray, you probably just haven't lived in the dorm long enough.

I'd say your roommate is 1000 times more important than the dorm choice tbh. DONT room with someone you know. Ive heard almost exclusively negative things about this. My roommate was awesome and I'm in my current friend group bc of her.

No doubt you'll have a really great first year!(Not all of it will be great, but that's life. You'll grow and reflect on the year like a new person once it's over.). Best of luck new freshman!

Anyone not like UGA as much as they would?,60,23,"As a guy who is gonna graduate this semester, I have a few thoughts.

I wasn't a big alcoholic partier (Downtown was not for me) nor was I involved in the big three organizations (Greek Life, Religous Wesley/Freshley, Volunteering Organizations), so I felt like I couldn't love the school as much as I thought it would. Seems like the people who weren't in those places stayed confined to their high school friend group. I also got an unfortunate dorm 2 bed room in ECV, since all the dorms were full my freshman year so I wasn't able to make bonds much. My social circle came from the apartments, but my roomates changed since I was paired with random roomates end up graduating the next semester.

&#x200B;

Still, a lot of great moments through my college life. I made a few great friends that are gonna graduate with me. My internship and degree got me a well paying job in New York City.  I am in the best shape  that I have had in my life currently. Mentally, I'm happy as I can be but looking back, I felt there could have been more.

1. I can live in upperclassmen dorms due to my veteran status/age and get my own room.
2. I'd be as close as possible to the campus and be more inclined to use all of the campus facilities and closer to the events. 
3. I'd be surrounded by other students which would help me build a support network since I'll know NO ONE in AZ when I move there.

Lizards in my bathroom?,43,31,"I’m living on campus this year in a private room with a private bathroom and have been dealing with all types of creatures popping up in/around my shower.

A Hungover Upperclassman's Guide to Drinking at ASU,499,55,"Alright, this seems like something I need to write up, given that you guys, especially the Freshmen, are going to drink regardless. But this post is hopefully going to prove helpful in keeping you all safe so that we don't lose any lives or have anyone getting hurt. 

1. **Eat and drink** before you start consuming alcohol, you should not drink on an empty stomach.

2. Pace yourself. You might be pounding shots left and right and feel fine...until it catches up with you and you're on the floor.

3. ***Any drink you did not see poured is not safe to drink***

4. If you put a drink down, go to the bathroom or something, and come back, ***That drink is no longer safe to drink***

5. Going to a party? Bring a friend or two or seven. 

6. Most CAs/Police/etc... don't care about you drinking and won't come looking for you unless you're being loud or doing something stupid. I've seen people pointing laser pointers out of windows in a cop's eyes at Vista before...it's dumb and they're going to find you. 

7. Keep your stuff generally hidden if you keep it in your dorm. ASU is a dry campus, and if maintenance or someone else comes through and there's bottles out they can report it. Maintenance generally doesn't care, but if a CA walks by while you're talking to someone in your door way and there's a bottle of jaeger on the table...you're screwed.

8. You do not have to open any cabinets or anything similar if a CA asks you, but they will go get a community director to do it if you refuse. 

9. ***IF SOMEONE IS NON-RESPONSIVE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL*** Them throwing up will not reduce their BAC, it'll just stop more alcohol from getting into their blood. If someone is non-responsive, they need to go to the hospital. **Even if you're underage, good samaritan laws keep you safe if you call 911 to save someone else.**

10. Do not join any organization that pressures you into any form of alcoholic hazing. Most organizations have wised up and knocked that off, but your life is not worth one night of excessive drinking. 

11. Pedialyte is your best friend, it'll replenish your electrolytes and make the hangover less bad. Create a hangover starter kit for the next morning with food and whatnot because you won't want to do it in the morning.

12. ***GET CONSENT.*** If someone is obviously drunk, take care of them, do not take advantage of them. Beyond the fact that it's a terrible thing to do to someone, you could severely damage their mental health because that is quite literally ***RAPE***, but you could face prosecution and jail time. Being a decent human should be enough motivation, but you could quite literally end your life via criminal charges if you don't get consent. Even if the other person pulls the ""I regret last night, it was rape"" thing, verbal consent helps protect you in case they decide to attempt to report you for that. It's not rape, but it can severely hurt you publicly and legally.

13. In general, I would say don't mix sex and alcohol at all to prevent any blurred lines, but you guys will really do what you want so please use common sense.

14. **IF YOU ARE GOING HOME WITH SOMEONE OR GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE/LEAVING A PARTY WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDS, LET THEM KNOW. SOMEONE SHOULD KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES**

15. Bonus: If you're meeting someone from Tinder/Grindr/Bumble/What have you, meet them in a public place first just to be safe. 

16. ASU is a dry campus and your body is a container. If you're of legal age and are walking through campus drunk, you're still violating ASU policy and can get screwed by standards. 

17. Have a game plan for how you're getting home. Who is calling the uber? Where is it dropping us? Who is staying sober enough to communicate? Generally, people at the party will help you out if you're too intoxicated, but having a plan in place stops panicking and makes things go smoother.

18. Know your limits, if you're 5'2"" and 100 lbs, you're not going to go shot for shot with someone who is 6'4"" and 250 lbs, you don't have to try and keep up, that'll just ruin your night when you hit the floor. 

19. Throwing up is fine, but it's not going to save you from alcohol poisoning. Again, it doesn't lower blood alcohol content, it just stops more in your stomach from entering the blood to a small extent.

20. After you throw up, do not brush your teeth right away, the acid will erode your teeth in addition to the brush grinding away at them. Drink some water, wait a bit, gargle water, and then either use mouthwash or brush your teeth. 

21. Set a budget, drinking is expensive, especially if you're 21 and are going to Mill, it is very easy to drop $50+ a night if you're not paying attention. Pre game if you have to (just not too hard)

22. Don't be afraid to call someone to help you, good friends will prioritize your life over their sleep if you're in danger.

Rape in the dorms?,80,18,"When I was 18 years old, I was raped in my dorm room.

I was hanging out with some girlfriends in their room and one of them invited the guy she was dating at the time. The guy brought a friend.

The friend was cute, and seemed to be showing interest in me. My girls were pushing me to chat with him and exchange snapchats, and he and I seemed to hit it off as the group of us played Cards Against Humanity.

He kissed me, and I kissed him back. It seemed innocent and fun – I didn’t realize the downward spiral that would follow.

The boys had been drinking so they didn’t want to drive home. I figured they would stay in my friends’ room, considering one of them was dating my friend and the other came with him. The one who showed interest in me offered to walk me back to my room.

I said I was fine – I’d had a Mike’s Hard Lemonade early in the night but at this point I was sober, and I lived right down the hall. He insisted.

He was a big guy, well over six foot and clearly worked out regularly – the type another guy wouldn’t want to get in a fight with, nevermind a small girl like me.

He walked me down the hall to my room, and I said goodbye. But when I unlocked the door he pushed it open, pushed me inside, and followed me in. He closed the door behind us. My roommate wasn’t home.

He led me into my room and began to kiss me. I kissed back, afraid of the repercussions if I didn’t. 

He began to take off my clothes, and I got more nervous.

I told him I wasn’t really in the mood to do anything else and that I had an early morning the next day. I said I wanted to get to sleep, so we should probably call it a night. He got into my bed and pulled me in with him.

Again, I was afraid to fight him on it. What would happen if I resisted? I was in a room by myself, my roommate wasn’t home, and he could overpower me with little to no effort at all. Would it be worth it to stand up for myself and tell him to leave if it could potentially result in physical harm to me?

I tried to go to sleep, but he had other plans. He pulled me on top of him and kissed me while removing my clothes. I told him to stop, he ignored me. I tried to physically resist, he climbed on top of me and pinned me down. While he was on top of me, he pulled his shorts and boxers down and began to move his hips toward my face.

I told him I’d never done anything like that before and really didn’t want to now. I pleaded with him to stop, he told me to shut up.

With his knees holding me down by the shoulders, he forced himself into my mouth and down my throat. I tried to push him off of me but he just pinned me down and thrusted harder, while I gagged and sobbed. He kept going until he was finished, letting it go across my chest. He got off of me to get a towel, which he threw at me from across the room.

I laid there mortified, sobbing, cleaning the semen of a man I didn’t know off of my skin.

I thought he would leave – hadn’t he gotten what he wanted? I guess not.

The man climbed back into bed with me, pinning me between his body and the wall with no way to escape. I had to sleep there, his arm around me and his body against mine.

I woke up to him climbing on top of me again, forcing me to relive the same experience as the night before twice more.

When he finally exhausted himself and decided to leave, I laid there for hours and cried. I felt empty, 
I felt violated, I felt alone, and, for whatever reason, I felt ashamed.

Why hadn’t I fought harder? Could I have stopped it? Was this my fault for kissing him back at the beginning of the night? Was I asking for it?

I didn’t tell anyone about my experience for months. It ate away at me, but I didn’t want anyone to look at my differently. I didn’t want to be blamed for something that was already tearing me apart.

I stayed single until the summer when I started dating someone I had become friends with through work. He seemed like a nice guy and cared for me.

After a few weeks, however, he called me out for being distant. He said I seemed to be holding back and he didn’t think I was as invested in the relationship as he was. He said I didn’t seem as interested in him because I wouldn’t perform the sexual acts that had been forced on me by the man a few months prior.

I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. To be fair, I told myself, he didn’t know what had happened to me. No one did.

That guy I was dating was the first person I opened up to about what happened to me. We were sitting in his car outside of my dorm, and I told him everything. I shared every detail of my experience, all of the things that had been consuming my mind for months. I shed tears, showing him the most vulnerable side of me.

And guess what his response was. He had the audacity to respond to my tale of pain and humiliation with, “Well I just don’t think that’s fair to me.”

I was in shock. How could the guy who is supposed to protect me and have my best interests in mind make himself the victim of my rape? How could he, knowing full well he was the first person to hear my story, turn it around on me and make me the bad guy?

The relationship ended that night. I got out of the car – disgusted, mortified, and depressed – and never looked back.

It was months before I told anyone else.

Now, I have a support system in my friends and my current boyfriend. But many girls don’t have that luxury.

The #MeToo movement has encouraged many women to speak out with their stories of sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, etc., but it’s no easy feat. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network claims that 11.2 percent of college students will experience rape or sexual assault, but that number seems low to me.

I also see a problem in the way people define rape. From what I’ve seen, many people think of rape as only forceful penetrative, vaginal sex. But dictionary.com defines rape as “unlawful sexual intercourse or any other sexual penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth of another person, with or without force, by a sex organ, other body part, or foreign object, without the consent of the victim.”

This is something that can be hard to grapple with as a survivor, but it is important to define things like rape and sexual assault when weighing how often things like this happen to students on campus.

Should I dorm in next semester if I want to rush?,3,3,"I'm currently a freshman commuting to ASU West, but I decided to transfer to tempe as a sophomore.

"[PSA] Make sure you guys are locking your bikes up, even the front tire.",36,8,"Just wanted to make a PSA, especially for the freshmen here. Make sure you guys are always locking your bikes up along with the front tire (the easiest one to remove). My bike's front tire got stolen and my bike was locked up in the inside area of my dorm building (of course the day of or after move-in, this happens). Make sure if you use a u-lock or something similar to lock to your bike frame, you also use a cable lock for your front tire. Most bike thieves will try to go for the whole bike, so that's why it's really important to lock your frame. Don't lock your whole bike up by a tire. If that tire is removed, your whole bike is gone. Front tires are easily removable, so make sure to secure that as well. Kryptonite also has locking nuts where the bike has to be upside down to remove it due to a locking pin on the inside. Cable locks can take about 30 seconds to cut through with hand tools, so don't use those to lock up your bike as a whole either.",csl4o1,asu

1.

What are some REALLY good reasons for living in a dorm vs being a homebody?,6,32,"EDIT: does anyone have any positive opinions?? Lol

Ok, so as it comes closer to graduation, I’ve been thinking to myself, “do I really want to live in a dorm, or am I just looking to prove my independence?”. I’m new to the whole dorm thing and know absolutely nothing about it, so I’m hoping someone with experience can hook me up with some advice.

And now that I’ve actually already signed up, I’ve started to really enjoy living at home (funny how I took that for granted for so long). My own privacy, a kitchen (and I’ve recently started eating really well and cooking for myself - in my culture, good food is so important), a clean bathroom, and a lot of living space.
And hey, I’d be saving THOUSANDS of my financial aid. That’s great in and of itself.
I’m also finally learning to drive over the summer, so I guess (?) traveling to UW from Bellevue is pretty ok.

In short:
Do you have any reasons to do dorms  in freshman year that beat:
-the privacy of your home 
-free housing
-free food and a kitchen for home cooking
-saving financial aid 

I have a cousin that’s about to graduate from UW. He moved into dorms during freshman year... dude lives in Seattle and could drive there in 10 minutes, 15-20 with bad traffic. He always seemed to advocate for it though, contributing most of his good experiences to social life. Then again, he’s the type of person that’s always been pretty popular and social, so I can’t say that I value that scene as much, but I respect his opinions. I’m also pre-med, so focusing on my studies is really important to me. 

From my research so far, people advocate for dorms AT LEAST in freshman year because of the social life, proximity to campus, and the “independence factor”. I do plan on joining lots of clubs and have a specific few in mind, already. Plus, I’m not a very social person to begin with - I enjoy hanging out, but just over lunch or a concert or something, and I love my time alone. The whole independence thing isn’t really an experience that I feel that I need right now, either (In short, a lot of the good and bad experiences I’ve had growing up have really taught me to be independent, from living alone to just getting things done - I’m finally getting used to living at home with my family, and it’s something that I value so much and kinda want to cling to for as long as I can before I can afford my own apartment).

But PROXIMITY. That’s a deal breaker. I wake up and I’m practically already at school? Honestly, what a steal. If not for the life I have at home now, I probably would’ve been in a dorm without a thought.

(PS: if I do end up being a homebody, should I have a job based in Seattle or Bellevue? Which makes more sense?)

While these are primarily commuter campuses, they have some 'limited' on-campus housing. Does any know anything about the housing for either of these schools? All I could gather was it seems like Bothell may have a bit more capacity with \~ 5 dorm style buildings. Tacoma's Court 17 is at capacity and has a wait list right now. They can accommodate 290 students which seems like a smallish percentage of the overall student population. I really don't know if Bothell can accommodate more.

How likely is it that I will get a dorm room as a sophomore?,3,17,"Hello. I'm currently a freshman living in McCarty. Next year, I want to move to Hansee, but I know that sophomores aren't guaranteed dorm rooms. I know that the freshman class gets bigger and bigger every year as well.

I'm aware most people transition to apartments or houses, but I need an income (no financial aid or job) and a credit score (no credit score) to be able to rent an apartment. The friends I have that are moving to houses have their own connections already.

Considering that Hansee is not as popular of a dorm hall, how likely is it that I will be able to get in? If not Hansee, then what about the probability of the other dorms?

If I can recall, they send out housing results in the summer. In the case that I can't get a spot, what am I supposed to do when I'll be away from Seattle for the summer, and most apartments/houses will be snagged already?

so I got a lot of replies and messages of people showing interest in having a get together, which is awesome! :)for those asking, it’s definitely still happening. here are the tentative details but if I get feedback of people wanting something to change, it’s flexible! 

When: Saturday October 19th at 8:00 pm

Where: Pacific Sunrise apartments (to the right of Greek row, above north campus dorms) for safety reasons I’m not putting a specific building/room number on here, but if you’d like to come, shoot me a message 20-30 min before getting here and I will come down and get you. 

Why: to have a fun night and meet some new friends, and go a lil crazy. and most of all, cause why not? 

Other details: 
- Our apartment is decent sized but definitely not enough to accommodate everyone who responded. If anyone else has a larger space that they’d like to host in, message me! As of now though, we’re going on a first come first serve basis, and we will probably cap it at 20-30 people. 
- If you’re willing to pitch a little bit, we are going to buy a decent amount of alcohol. But in general, it will be BYOA, and anything else you want to bring. 

I have no idea if this is going to be a total bust or not, but we won’t know until we try! Either way, it will certainly be interesting haha. Can’t wait to see ya!

I have heard there is an apartment complex on campus that allows students keep animals. I believe it's Steven's Court? Please correct me if I'm wrong!

Dorm theft?,3,9,"Incoming freshman here, Is it really that common?

I’m in a single, so I’m the only one in charge of locking the door to my room. If I keep my door locked when I leave, is there still a chance? I wanted to bring a gaming system in and I’ll need my laptop for classes, but if people are really that prone to stealing things, should I just not bring the gaming system? Do I really need to keep my laptop locked in a desk drawer? What about in public spaces?

Quad dorms?,1,2,"Roomie and I are trying to decide which hall to live in next year. We're incoming freshman. I'm in the honors program so we have the option to live in Landis, but have a crappy contract number so we think we'll get stuck with a triple or a quad room. Our impression was that a quad room was four beds in one bedroom with a bathroom attached for its 4 residents to use. Roomie heard from a friend this wasn't the case, we emailed the honors coordinator. Here's what he said:

> A quad is just two doubles sharing a bathroom. It is not 4 people in one room. A triple is 3 people in a room sharing a bath or a single and a double sharing a bath. The easiest way to look at it is the number of people sharing a bath with the maximum in a room being 3.


We're confused now, because we thought that the standard double was two two-person rooms with a bathroom between them. So now the question is-- what are quads, triples, and doubles, how many people use one bathroom, and how crappy would it be to be stuck in a quad room?

Electric scooter for getting around campus?,3,10,"My SO’s sister just started this semester and she’s dorming on campus.

Even if she had a car, it’d take longer for her to get her car, drive, find parking again, etc. the way her classes are. 

She really wants one of those electric scooters, are they allowed? Like the ones that go like 10MPH. She said she sees people using electric skateboards but we just want to be sure. 

We were going to get one that has the bigger non-puncture wheels to help her get over cracks and so she doesn’t have to worry about flats. And the one we’re looking at, she can use a U-lock on a wheel to lock it to a bike rack. 

We just want to make sure we don’t make an investment in one and then she’s told she can’t use it.

Depressed,9,13,"Hi. I'm just an average honors student at FSU who likes anime, video games, and animals. I'm a Pre-Vet student.

I've been depressed for a few weeks now. This week especially has been rough. I feel stupid, lonely, and miserable. I lost my anime strap on my backpack, I have tripped/fallen multiple times and have bruised up my knees, I was rejected by Delta Nu Zeta, I have not be contacted back for a job I wanted, and I have failed my second algebra quiz. I feel like nobody even wants me and I'm just a waste of space. I was rejected by the Marching Chiefs in August but it is just now hitting me hard. I had ""friends"", but they have all suddenly become ""busy"" and have left me behind. I know people who have purposely ignored me and have walked away from me for no reason at all.

I try to talk to people. I try to go to events. I try and use my college social media. I try to go out and eat in public. I try and get a job. But nobody wants me. Nobody cares about me. I'm just an awkward loser who struggles with anxiety. I get suicidal thoughts often but I'd never go through with it (too scared to). I just want to have a happy, successful life. I hate being that one kid who just walks around with my headphones on and goes back to my dorm afterwards because nothing eventful is going on in my life.

I just feel cruddy because I see people around me who are happy, surrounded by friends, getting everything they have wanted, and passing their classes with flying colors. I feel like I am a super unlucky kid and I never get to actually be happy.

I don't want therapy. I just want friends. I want to be able to feel smart. I want people to want to say hi to me, walk with me, eat with me, and text me out of class. I just want reassurance that I'm wanted and I'm not just a loser.

Some Meal Plan Due Diligence,26,19,"Should I buy a meal plan at FSU?

Let me answer that for you.

Before we begin:

I do not have a meal plan.

Many freshman have meal plans because it's quick, easy, and a good way to meet people (or so I heard). It is my first semester here, but I am technically a freshman.

With a meal plan you get 3 guest passes. I don't know how they work, but I think you can bring anyone/ mooch off a friend.

You can use VIP Swipes/Garnet/Flex Bucks at any restaurant on campus.

Restaurants on campus include: Subway, steak and shake, Seminole pies (a pizza place), some asian cuisine place, chick fil a, 4 Rivers (a smoke house), Starbucks, a smoothie place in the Leech, and pollo tropical.

The Door prices at Suwannee:

* Breakfast: $7.50
* Lunch: $9.00
* Dinner: $10.50

Lets get started:

\*CPM = Cost per Meal

**The unlimited Plan:** 

[Unlimited 2 meals a day](https://i.redd.it/kg5ubb6b5cs21.png) CPM: $9.24

[Unlimited 3 meals a day](https://i.redd.it/tpbiqpic5cs21.png) CPM: $6.16

[Unlimited 4 meals a day](https://i.redd.it/9yxsin1e5cs21.png) CPM: $4.62

[Unlimited 5 meals a day](https://i.redd.it/9if9vlxf5cs21.png) CPM: $3.70

This is assuming there are 100 days in the semester (IDK. This is an estimate, could be more, could be less). Obviously the unlimited plan makes more sense if you are going to go really often to eat.

&#x200B;

The rest of the meal plans are fixed prices.

&#x200B;

**The ""200 Your Way"" plan.**

[200 Your way](https://i.redd.it/014cotic6cs21.png) CPM: $9.32

&#x200B;

**The ""135 Freedom"" Plan:**

[135 freedom](https://i.redd.it/9qvrb53k6cs21.png) CPM: $7.87

&#x200B;

**The ""100 Flex"" Plan:**

[100 flex](https://i.redd.it/5pui9a6p6cs21.png) CPM: $8.50

&#x200B;

**The ""65 Seminole"" Plan:**

[65 seminole](https://i.redd.it/hmxsa6ds6cs21.png) CPM: $8.43

Obviously, divide all of the ""costs per meal"" that by 2, 3, or 4 if you are going to have your friends/siblings follow you in. That is when the prices start to be ""reasonable"".

&#x200B;

All of the incoming freshmen and parents of freshmen are asking themselves if a meal plan makes sense. As it stands, I don't really see the reason to buy one, just pay door prices for when you want to go, but again, it's all about convenience.

I'm currently a freshman here at Pitt, and although my roommate and I have never really gotten along, our issues have been escalating over the past few weeks to the point where I do not feel safe or comfortable living in my dorm. I talked to my RA about a possible room change, but she said that the RD is very strict with room changes and that a switch next semester may not be likely. She said that the RD is reluctant to approve people moving out of the dorm because she prefers that people get along and work things out, but I feel that my situation is beyond that at this point.

I have been asking my upperclassmen friends for advice, as well as a friend of mine who is an RA at a different university. They have all said that this is not necessarily the case, and that I should be able to move out next semester without as much difficulty as my RA had implied.  Some have suggested that I go to Panther Central, but I feel like I will be told the same thing by them.

I can understand how it might be more difficult to move me to a room within the same residence hall, but is moving somewhere else, say, a single in Holland, just as difficult?  How should I go about this?  If anyone has experience with reslife and/or relocating, your insight would be appreciated. Thank you!",e7hrhw,Pitt

I just wanted to know if these kinds of ACs are the ones the school is super against having in rooms or if it’s just the window units.

LFM for Heroes of the Dorm Team,0,3,"Hello current Pitt Students,

Blizzard is currently hosting an event called Heroes of the Dorm. This is a chance for each college to build their team(s) to compete with other colleges around the nation.

The finalists win tuition money, and are flown out ( think it is also paid for entirely ) to compete in the Grand Finals.

I have currently made a team, titled Cake Wolves, and I am currently looking for additional players interested in winning, but are also amazing at communicating, and are NOT toxic.

The title of the team is open to be changed ( I am not picky about that) but I am interested in coming together over the next few weeks and doing dedicated training regimes in hopes to win.

Why even bother trying?

Because the player pool will be surprisingly small, and limited. Not anyone can join (no need to worry about uber pros) and it is open only to teams fully complete with eligible team members. This means that we'll have an incredibly good shot at making the finals, and possibly winning.

>National Championship Prizing:
>
> * Players: Tuition for up to 3 years - up to $75,000 USD total
> * Substitute: Tuition for 1 year - up to $25,000 USD total

I am looking for people who:

* Have played HotS consistently, or are good at LoL or other moba games. 
* Players who are interested and are committed. (No flakers)
* Individuals who are non-toxic and can cooperate, and are excited.

If you have any questions just message me on reddit.

Thanks.

Pitt vs CMU: WiFi battles,0,4,"Pitt has an obvious issue: according to the most recent [University Fact Book ](https://pre.ir.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FactBook2018.pdf)(issued by the Office of Institutional Research) we have about 12,000 full time employees on the main campus and almost 26,000 full time students (including grads and post-docs). That’s a LOT of people to serve speedy internet to. 

It’s safe to assume that most employees are not using huge amounts of the WiFi bandwidth as most are either on their phones or desktop (which likely has an Ethernet connection). No, the problem is likely to reside largely with the students. There’s a few obvious bottlenecks: huge lecture halls, public spaces, and most importantly the dorms. 

The biggest lecture halls need enough bandwidth to support about 2-300 students. This has gotten considerably better in my time (I just graduated). Have you ever looked up and took note of all the routers on the ceiling? - most of that wasn’t there when I started in 2015. Public spaces like the union or even the lawn need WiFi as well. This a a bit harder not only bc the number of users in this category are wildly variable but also bc of the vast amount of space the WiFi needs to travel to get full coverage of campus; secondary to those problems is speed, you need coverage before you can talk about speed. Dorms... Pitt stands against torrenting (as it legally must), but there’s little to stop individuals from doing it anyway, provided they take certain precautions against getting caught. Then there’s the video gamers who demand zero latency, and the YouTube and Netflixers who don’t want to watch in shitty 480p and have to wait for the video to buffer every 5min. These activities demand a *huge amount of bandwidth. In the case of towers, you have 120 students in 145,000ft^3 (you can likely catch the WiFi from the floors above and below you). While the density of lecture halls is undeniably higher, it’s unlikely that _many_ students are participating in high bandwidth activities. 

Add to the above that the exponential advances in technology mean that the internet is getting more complex as our tech gets better and better. What this means in plain terms is that Pitt has to continually upgrade the routers and supply higher and higher bandwidth to students as new devices leverage more efficient processors to create complex and speedy environments that are more data demanding. 

CMU tackles the problem differently: they more or less guarantee speedy internet, but they cap your data usage. 

> No individual [per login credentials] on the wired/wireless network should use more than 10 gigabytes (10GBs) of bandwidth per day, [or average more than 10GBs per day over any five day period], regardless of whether it is inbound or outbound over the network.

This is a huge issue if you are torrenting, running a full node (making money on Pitt not charging for electricity usage), streaming videos all day, and/or chronically playing video games. (Btw good luck doing something of questionable legality on the CMU network and not getting caught.) Granted CMU also does not have nearly as many students as Pitt, but the _average_ student of CMU is likely more savvy than a Pitt student, meaning their school needs to be more vigilant with regard to runarounds. 

**TLDR: would you rather have to pay a flat rate for continual upgrades that guarantee speedy WiFi, or deal with a data usage cap?**",cnl06k,Pitt

To Cloudy at Pitt? (And other questions),4,12,"I'm a senior in high school right now and I will most likely be coming to Pitt next fall but I just figured I'd field a kind of particular question I had here.

 I'm genetically pre-disposed to have Seasonal Affective Disorder (look it up, it's basically just like the fancy word for seasonal depression), and I noticed I often feel it the most after a long string of completely cloudy days. I know Pittsburgh is one the cloudiest cities in the US (rip), so that poses as a little bit of problem for me. 

Would y'all say that when it's cloudy it's completely cloudy all day with no sun at all? And more days than not? I don't consider this a dealbreaker for me, but it'd be good to get an idea so I know what I'm getting into.  

Also, while I'm here- Is having a roommate an essential part of the freshmen dorm experience? I value having personal space that's only mine a little more than the average extrovert (because I'm an introvert), and in some of the dorm's it's only a little bit more for a single vs a double. I know it varies from one person to another, and I know having a roommate is a good way to make friends, so I'm torn. Thanks

I will be in bouquet this year and I want to give my appartment WiFi.

I am getting a new laptop at the end of the summer because my old one is on the fritz. The good news is the the old one is in good enough condition to still handle an Ethernet pass through, so my current plan is to go Ethernet port>> computer>> router. Will I have any problems with this setup or will Pitt be able to see that? 

I have also heard there is a way to do it by having the router ""clone"" your computers Mac address, does this also work?

I will also take the precautions of having a hidden and secure network.

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks!!",1ihlgw,Pitt

Advice for an Undergrad living at Centre and considering switching to a less asocial dorm?,11,7,"I'm a Sophomore currently dorming in Centre Plaza Apartments, and honestly I kind of hate it. My roommates are both great guys who I have no problem talking to for hours, but we're all so busy with schoolwork and other friends that I never see them. Which would be fine if I had ever interacted with another person living in my dorm.

Besides that, the security guards are complete assholes, (especially that redheaded one...) the distance from campus is tolerable but less preferable to, say, Lothrop Hall, and though this may be stupid, as someone who never carries cash, the fact that I have to use quarters for the washing machine aggravates me to no end. 

But I've really been considering talking to Panther Central about applying to either an Honors College dorm like Forbes-Craig in the hope that someone happens to study abroad next semester and a space opens up, or just asking my friend who's an RA at Lothrop to put in the good word for me with ResLife.

Just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do, namely people who have lived in Centre and/or have gone through the same type of dilemma. ",1o17g2,Pitt

All of last year, my friends here kept saying “I’m too busy, let’s go next week.” Well it’s not a surprise it happened again today lol. I’m pretty introverted and love to spend most quiet nights staying in just chilling, but every once in a while I wanna go out, yknow? None of my friends want to go out ever though. The ones who do are over 21 and go to bars instead. I would go to Cruze myself, but I feel it wouldn’t be that fun alone OR that safe.

Welcome to the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am glad you are here. You made it through four-years of high school. Many of you are going to accomplish great things here and have a lot of fun. But before we get to the good stuff, there are some housekeeping things you ought to know. Some unspoken rules you need to follow.

&#x200B;

1. Walk on the right side. That's it. Don't walk with four of the same people on the path. Walk in groups of two or by yourself. As you will quickly realize, there are a lot of people here that need to get to a lot of places in a short amount of time.
2. If you are on the 80, pay attention. Please walk to the back of the bus so other students are on it. Your fellow classmates will thank you when because you moved, they were able to make it to their class on time without freezing off their balls off.
3. The bus system works like this : Before your stop comes, you pull the yellow string  and a bell rings to let the driver know. On the new 80, I think you have to press the yellow strip. Also, please say thank you to ours(and your) bus drivers as they work really long hours, dealing with college kids, driving the same route.
4. When going into lectures, if you are first, go in to the middle of the row. Sit on the outside ONLY if you need to get to another class quickly.
5. Speaking of lectures, if you are waiting for a lecture to be over, so you can go in. Please give the people that are coming out more than enough space. It will save both of you time.
6. If you are using one of the recreational facilities (Nat or Shell or Ogg) and using the weight room during the busy time, if there are people waiting, ask them if they want to work in. If you are waiting, ask them if you can work in with them. Most people will let you. Additionally, be aware of your surroundings (it's a small area for so many people) as there will be guys (especially the powerlifters) who will be squatting and benching a lot of weight - make sure you don't bump into them.
7. Speaking of the gym, clean the equipment and please put the weights back. Simple but some people just don't get it.

&#x200B;

If the freshman here have any questions, comment below or message me. Additionally, let these ""unspoken"" rules know to your friends as they will benefit from them as well.

Senior Badgers of this subreddit, if you have any other tips for our freshman class, please write them in the comments below. Additionally, if anything in this list needs to be moderated or edited, let me know as well.

On Wisconsin!

**Edit 1 :** This is life advice in general but necessary for the freshman. If you are the one that does not like to partake in drinking, smoking, doing drugs, etc., do Not feel pressured to try those things. Forcing yourself to do those things will make you drop your self-esteem and create self-hatred, which can lead to mental health issues such as depression. Trust me when I say but it’s better to be lonely with self-esteem than broken with “friends”.

If you are making any big decision, sleep on it and then make it the next day. Don’t rush it. You have plenty of time.",cyu2y0,UWMadison
Lost Keys at Dejope,5,3,"I lost my keys today in Dejope, fairly certain they fell out of my pocket while eating at one of the longer tables. I already checked in with the desk there and the dishwashing line and they didn't have it, so that's where I'm at. Do any of you have past experience with campus lost and found procedure? I have my two loner keys still but I'm hoping I can avoid using them for a little bit by propping my door open. Any information about how to proceed is gladly accepted. Or, better yet, if anyone has seen them, please do let me know (somehow, I have no idea how reddit really works tbh). 

\*This is my first post on reddit, so sorry if I come across a bit ignorant.",e0aju8,UWMadison
What dorms would I fit into??,0,15,"I have been trying to look at the various stereotypes for the dorms on campus to get a feel for where I would fit in. I definitely want a social dorm where it is easy to make friends and has the ""door open culture"", co-ed floors, and floors that are typically close overall. I am not super into drinking (idk if this will change in college), but more into smoking (some forums said this occurs more at Lakeshore?). When I took a tour of Wisconsin, I liked the beauty of the Lakeshore landscape, but also liked the central location of the South East dorms. The dorms that appeal to me as of now, based on what I have read on reddit, are Sellery, Witte, Kronshage, Ogg, and Sullivan. Any thoughts on these dorms and others I may fit into? Thank you.",aw0xsw,UWMadison

Admitted Transfer student,0,3,Hello I just got accept as Spring transfer last night. There are few housing options for me either on-campus transfer housing or other housings or off-campus.

Dorm roommate question,4,21,"I’m an incoming freshman, and y’all are probably tired of answering questions but I gotta ask-

Did you get a random roommate? If not, how did you find/meet your roommate beforehand? I don’t know where to look and none of my friends are going to Madison ",a8xtay,UWMadison
Dorm Questions About Ogg/Smith/Cole/Sullivan!,0,4,"First of all, sorry for adding to the multitude of dorm posts on here, I'll try to make this short lol.

So I just committed to Madison yesterday and am so excited! My top dorms for next year are Witte, then Sellery. A priority for me is being in a social environment where I can meet people easily (coming from CA I don't really know anyone). I do not have a big preference concerning Southeast vs. Lakeshore, but to my understanding Southeast just tends to be more social.  

I'm debating whether to rank Ogg/Smith or Sullivan/Cole third and fourth on my preferences. 

1. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I have seen on past dorm posts, it seems like Sullivan/Cole are the more social dorms of Lakeshore.  Are there any distinguishing differences between these two dorms? Are there any other social dorms in Lakeshore? 
2. I notice that there are upperclassmen in Ogg and Smith... Are these dorms overwhelmingly upperclassmen? 
3. Do you think I would be better off ranking Ogg/Smith higher or Sullivan/Cole? I will give some more info about me: I am a white female originally from NJ, but in CA for high school. I prefer smoking to drinking, though this may change in college. I love being around people and really hope to have a floor that is really close, and so I like the ""door open culture"". 

Thank you all for taking the time to read this, it is much appreciated!!! ",b8e2nf,UWMadison
sorry for another dorm preference question - tis the season,0,4,"I am debating which to put first witte or sellery.  Will the  construction be over by Fall?  Which would you recommend.

After these 2 which are the most social and have the highest percentage of freshmen.

And last, what if I only put down 3-5 dorms in my preference sheet.  Does that mean I will get one?  What if i don't?  Will it be too late then to get statesider ?

TIA 

ps If you feel like answering - should i come to wisco?",b6aqov,UWMadison
feeling like the backup friend and don't know what to do,55,28,"hey guys, i'm a freshie here in madison and it's been extremely rough for me. I lowkey always feel like the backup friend when others are doing stuff and i keep missing out on things to do because i don't get invited to them. 

I tried to make friends with some of the people in my dorm but I don't really think they want to hang out with me as much as I want to hang out with them, and because i spent all my time in the beginning of the month hanging out with them I wasn't able to get to know anyone else on my floor. I also know other people outside of my dorm but they all have groups that they're close with and I just feel like I don't really have people I can hang out with consistently. It doesn't help that everyone has like high school friends that go here so they usually go and hang out with them instead. I tried joining a few clubs and I wasn't able to make friends quick enough in those either, and since clubs have now gotten underway it's kind of awkward if i try to join one now. Like i want to go to events and stuff with other groups of people but I'm not close enough with anyone for anyone to actually think about me when going to those events, if that makes any sense.

I just feel like I completely fucked up when trying to make friends the past few weeks and I don't know what to do now.",dlspvy,UWMadison
HELP ME! Dorm questions.,2,19,"I recently got accepted here at UW and will be attending as a freshman next fall.  I've started researching dorms and **here is what I'm like and what I'm looking for:**

\-Definitely looking for a good partying scene.  Pretty active ""partier"" in hs, and am looking forward to the whole new level of partying I hear is here in Madison. That being said, however, I still value academics quite a bit (was top 1% in my class in hs) and want to be able to study and get plenty of peaceful sleep on weekdays.  I'm a little introverted and would like to learn to be more extroverted and open to others, so I want to grow socially as a person and explore outside of my current comfort zone.  I obviously want to make some great friends here right away so I have people to go to football games and parties with right away.   I am not super keen on the idea of sharing a bathroom with the whole floor, as I get grossed out by that kind of stuff, but can probably learn to deal with it if the other benefits of the dorm are worth it.  I would not be thrilled to see puke in the sinks and nasty toilets when I wake up in the morning. I don't have a budget for the dorm.  What dorm seems best for me? Oh, and I'm a a male, if that has anything to do with it, lol. 

**Some questions I have:**

\-I heard lakeshore students have a stigma of being introverted, non-partier's.  Is this true? I want it to be fairly easy to meet new people.

\-Do the dorms with floor-shared bathrooms keep the bathrooms fairly clean?  Is it worth choosing a dorm with the bathrooms shared by four rooms, or individual bathrooms?

\-What are your experiences with the room conditions, ability to sleep and study, and meet new people and party in your dorm?

Thanks!",aeouvp,UWMadison
Transitioning from summer apartment to dorm,1,4,"I will be in madison for the entirety of the summer working with the CFYE, so I will be living in a subletted apartment, but for Fall, I will be in the dorms, where move-in date is typically very late August.

Trying to Find a House for Next Year,20,6,"I am currently a freshman living in the dorms, but I am looking to get a house next year. I am looking at places with 5 bedrooms, but it is quite challenging as it seems that most house postings are out of date and when I contact landlords I don't get a response (for reference, I am mainly using zillow).

Possible-future-badger kitchen/veg question!,0,7,"Hi! I'm a HS senior nearby interested in attending Madison next year.

I have some dietary restrictions (including vegetarian/veganism) and I'm definitely nervous about living in the dorms and the fact that none of them include a kitchen option(?). (Also, local/on-campus options for someone like me? Any restaurant/menu recommendations?)

Do you guys know of anywhere in Madison I'd be able to... use a kitchen? Somewhere on campus? I know that sounds like a crazy question but I'm just looking for anything to reassure me.

Also -- are the privately-owned dorms a solid option, especially for a freshman...? Some of them have kitchens from what I can tell. I'm not sure the kitchen thing is worth a huge rent uptick but it might be nice to know.

"PSA: CollegeWorks Painting ""Internship"" Pyramid Scam. Recruiting from large underclassmen classes",197,24,"Big PSA to new students, CollegeWorks Painting preys on your desire to get ""work experience"" and ""opportunity"" with the guise of exclusivity and a vacuous ""$10,000 average"" (that somehow never changes from year to year...) to make it seem desirable and competitive. 

They're extremely aggressive in targeting large classes with high underclassmen ratios. ""If you cast a wide enough net..."" Most professors don't know what they're platforming by letting these speakers come in.

Essentially, they want you to run a painting business over the summer, be your own manager, hire your own staff, buy materials, yadda yadda. It's all smoke and mirrors doublespeak for MLM (multi-level marketing, see /r/antiMLM) or ""pyramid scheme.""

Friends 101,51,33," 

What's good everybody? I hope y'all are doing great.

So,  this might seem as the stupidest question ever because the answer is  something that everybody obviously knows except for me since most people  found their friend group here at UW-Madison. However, I decided to  write on reddit what I personally feel, to give context in hopes that  I'd find someone who has had gone through something similar before and  had overcome it or found a solution to it. Also, I don't feel I can tell  anyone about this so I'm hoping to find any useful tips, advice, info,  or anything else.

So, to begin,  I'm shy af ,I have a single room, and to top all that I'm living in a  lake shore dorm, which I believe makes my problem a 100 times worse. I  knew that it wouldn't be easy to make friends but I didn't think it  would be this difficult as I found out that any time I attempt to  socialize, I just can't due to my shy and awkward ass. To give you  perspective of how bad my problem is, I see people in my dorm hallway  and I even find trouble in spitting a simple word such as ""hey"" or ""hi""  and whenever I attempt to do it seems like the most awkward s\*\*\* EVER,  something I'm sure most people don't find trouble doing.

It's  been almost a month since I moved into my dorm and the number of people  that I know? ZERO. Before coming to UW, I felt that it was much easier  to do all the stuff I mentioned.

My  point is: I want to say ""hi"" to the guy next door, I want to sit with  someone during lunch, I want to laugh about stupid shit with friends but  I CAN'T.  It's the complete opposite, I basically hang around in my  room by myself: reading, watching YouTube, listening to music, looking  at memes, and doing homework. It's frustrating to think about all this  and even more frustrating to write whole paragraphs about it but I  really need it.

Any input to help a guy out? Thanks a bunch <3",d4enex,UWMadison

What I think is the issue is the laundry bins by the door. I guess I could stick the clothes in a bag and keep it shut, but I’m not sure if my roommate is willing to comply. Even then I don’t know if that will improve the smell. I’ve tried dousing the room in febreze. Didn’t work.

I hate it but hella trying not to,42,48,"Hi. I'm an out of state freshman. I couldn't afford dorms, so I had to settle down for a room that is rented in a house. All rooms are rented out, and there are about 10 roommates. I lived here for 3 days, and so far hated it.

Maybe this is due to being homesick or the fact that I'm sleeping on a floor right now. Or the fact that maybe my expectations were just too high. So my room is pretty small which is something I'm okay with. But I have another very small door leading to an inside of a roof (which I did not know about from the photos). From there, ants are coming in (like 5 or so, so nothing bad) but we are getting pest control to look into that. Then, the whole place was dirty. There is crap in the crack between the carpet and the floor and the space between the window and the filter thing haven't been cleaned in years and still have food wrappers in it. The bathroom is also pretty bad but it might be due to iron content within the water, which is why a lot of it is orange.

Downstairs, they are still catching mice (they killed all but one) and it's so cold because of the ac that I wake up during the night (I put something on the ac hole, so hopefully it would make it better). The whole place is old and the basement is a nightmare.

I talked to my roommates whether they like it here, and they say that it mainly depends from other roommates. One even said that I was lucky to get this place because the landlord is absolutely amazing (which she is).

I've been trying to love Madison and been exploring with an amazing local friend. But honestly, its been very hard. I have to do this, and it's only for 4 years but so far I've hated my whole experience so far.

Wait Alcohol is banned in upperclass dorms?,110,21,"So I came here and checked into my room with a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey and a case of beer on my person. I keep a decent sized whiskey and spirits collection at home particularly North American made whiskeys. I don't bring most of it with me because I don't drink that often maybe just a bit in a glass once or twice a week with gaps of a few weeks where I don't drink except for a beer with dinner here or there. So we have our meeting and apparently alcohol is banned in City Station South. I don't recall ever reading simething like that. I thought alcohol was just banned in dorms where the residents are often under 21. What kind of commie shit is this? I've seen the admins drink at some ball not so long ago. This is some tyrannical nonsense. I pay my taxes and am of age. Not to mention the taxes I pay *on* *the* *whiskey*.

Nobody is gonna stop drinking. I'm certainly not. I have opaque locked containers how are they going to find it? Regardless the punishments are so severe. I've been at a few colleges with some of my friends who go to other schools. Usually they have educational stuff for the first few times you get caught where as RPI basically says yeet after the first time.

They run a fucking pub that let's you get intoxicated. They pace you. No one's getting proper fucked up. A bastion of drinking responsibly. I know I've gotten reasonably drunk there multiple times. They've served me upwards of 6 pints plenty of times. Why the hell not? Not like I do it every month at most maybe twice a semester. I'm not pissing myself or passing out I have at most 7 or 8 over about 2 hours with some friends and we all try different beers together and call it a night so we don't get blackout or get a bad hangover. It seems they understand adults can regulate themselves but just want us to have to pay the for the pubs overpriced beer.

"How would I choose a dorm, have a major, and choose classes such that I maximize the amount of walking per day? (and conversely the least walking)",17,12,"I looked at the amount of walking on my busiest day (putting all the buildings to google maps), and I found I walk about a mile on that day (it says 0.8 miles, but I think google maps takes the shortest route).

Why is Nason Hall’s heat the way it is,20,13,"This is a whiny little piece of crap rant, so I apologize in advance. Please bear with me.

Our dorms are in such a condition that my closet door unhinges itself from the hooks every third time I need to open it to a point where it becomes necessary to literally rip it off to prevent injury (yes, I really had to do this), but I can’t unhinge the actual window door that legitimately needs unhinging in order to prevent heat stroke. Ever since first snowfall, the heaters have been on full blast to a point where it’s become painful, and because our windows only open up a crack and are screwed in such that we can’t open them more, there’s no way to get any sort of fresh cold air circulating inward.

It would be insanely cost efficient to both 1) not have said window stops set up in each room to prevent us from leaping out and killing ourselves (??) and 2) not use the heaters to the extreme degree that they are currently being used. I know I sound like a whiny piece of crap, but I can’t get any through work or sleep when I (and many other people in my dorm) are sweating profusely despite the fact that it’s twenty below freezing outside. It’s weird to know this is what our tuition is going towards—another thing to add to the list of things that our school is spending money on but we don’t need or even remotely want.",dx2q89,RPI

Protest About Alcohol Ban,60,18,"So I've decided that planning a protest/demonstration is actually a pretty good idea. How have demonstrations worked in the past? Ideally there's a bit of public property relatively close to campus. If we ask RPI the aristocrats in the administration are gonna give us a hard no so asking is likely a dead end. How would we do this safely and effectively? How many of you would be interested?

Definitely points of focus:

21 y/o should be able to drink and the alcohol ban should be abolished, and the rules as they are will not be obeyed due tho their stringent and tyrannical nature. Tyranny such as that isn't just immoral but limiting to people whose culture includes drinking alcohol.

Frats shouldn't be banned from having alcohol. (Actually I think the frat council had something to do with that right? Maybe I heard wrong.)

The zero tolerance policies is extraordinarily harsh and should be abolished and replaced with something educational in nature.

Power over prohibited substances incidents not subject to state or federal law should be given to the J board or at least something with student input.",cyisyu,RPI

Freshman year:

* You open your IEA binder. Inside you find nothing but Chem notes. You look through your Calculus notebook. Chemical equations cover the pages. You search your HASS folder for the latest assignment and pull out a completed Chemistry worksheet. You can’t remember ever going to your Chemistry class.
* You are working on your CAD assignment. It is due tomorrow. It is 1:30 AM. It is always 1:30 AM. Bleary-eyed, you stare at your laptop’s digital clock for a full ten minutes. You blink slowly. It is 1:30 AM.
* Day two of NRB week. You meet ten new people. Only one shares your major. She lives in a different dorm. She has not heard of your dorm. You meet twenty new people. You tell them where you are living; none of them live in your dorm. You are beginning to wonder if anyone lives in your dorm.
* The first day of school is tomorrow. You are already in a group chat with some other students on campus. As everyone makes their way to the field house for convocation, a car with its windows rolled down speeds past you. The car is full of people, people not much older than you. ""TURN BACK NOW! TURN BACK, BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE!"", they scream out the windows. Everyone laughs and continues forward. Still smiling, you follow them.
* You approach your dorm building. You can hear someone walking behind you as you scan your keycard and open the door. The footsteps follow you up the stairs. You scan your keycard again. The footsteps follow you halfway down the hall. Suddenly, they stop. You quickly glance behind you. There is no one there.
* You enter the bathroom with your bath caddy. You notice someone has left a bottle of body wash on the counter. You shrug and wash your face. After drying off, you open your eyes. There are two bottles of body wash on the counter.
* You are on your way to your first class of the day. The path to the bridge always appears shorter than it was the day before. Today you step outside and the bridge is in front of you. Where are the other dorms? Where are the wooden stairs? Dozens of students appear, coming from behind you, towards you, around you, and cross the bridge with blank faces. Blankly, you follow them.
* You are in three group chats. They are all on different apps.
* You put a load of laundry in one of the machines. It says it will be done in 36 minutes. You set your phone’s timer and go to your room. When you come back, the machine is still running. Your laundry will be done in 15 minutes. Confused, you look down at your phone and reset your timer for 15 minutes. You look back up. Your laundry will be      done in 17 minutes.
* You exit the shower. There are two bottles of body wash and a tube of toothpaste on the counter.
* Today is the career fair. Students you recognize are walking to class in business attire. Students you don’t recognize are walking to class in business attire. Tall, faceless figures in business attire pass you on the bridge.
* You are up late studying calculus. Your eyes are tired. You can hear sounds of construction coming from across the street. Why are they making so much noise in the middle of the night? It’s so late! It’s... You glance at the clock. It’s 1:30 AM. You turn back to your calculus textbook and read about Lewis dot diagrams.
* Nothing in Commons tastes real. You come to realize that nothing in Commons is real, not even you.
* The bus is late. It is delayed by 11 minutes. You wait. Buses going in the wrong direction pass you. Buses with no drivers pass you. Buses going to places you’ve never heard of pass you. You check the bus tracker app. The bus is delayed by 40 minutes.
* The squirrels are brave here. They dart across the path in front of you, jumping into bushes, tripping over themselves in their haste. Why are they in such a hurry?
* The weeks are blending together. You can remember neither what you did nor when you did it. You no longer have any concept of time.
* Everyone’s RA is different. Some are never in their room. Some are always in their room. A friend of yours went drinking with her RA. Another caught his RA smoking weed. Your friends laugh about these things. You sweat, wondering whether you should laugh about your RA’s fangs.
* You are in five group chats. Two of them have the same people.
* There are two bottles of Dove body wash, a tube of toothpaste, and a makeup sponge on the counter. The bathroom trash has been overflowing for two days; you cannot see the bin anymore. Q-tips are everywhere—on the floor, on the counter, in the sink, on the windowsill, in the showers.
* It’s a visitation day. You know this because the skies are blue, rather than their usual gray. As the seventh tour group you’ve seen today approaches, you suddenly get the unmistakable feeling of Shirley Ann Jackson watching you. You smile at the tour group as they pass.

Sophomore year:

* You have new emails about the ARCH. The ARCH is coming. The ARCH is coming. The ARCH is coming. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? You look at your junior friends. Something invisible in their eyes has broken.
* You have to take different routes to class now than you did as a freshman. There are many ways to get to the same building, but which route is the quickest? You try all of them and realize it does not matter. None of them are fast enough.
* You go to Commons for dinner. Everything about it looks different. As you sit down with your plate, surrounded by chattering freshmen, you wonder if you only dreamed that those horrid long tables existed. You take a bite of your food. Somehow, it hasn’t changed with everything else. Somehow, it still isn't real.",dbnbbx,RPI

North + E-Complex Mice Infestation,137,16,"So.... I'm just wondering when the higher level administration are going to care enough to do something serious about the mice in North & E-Complex. (It seems like they are starting to pay more attention to this sub-reddit so I'm going to try and use it to my advantage!!) 

The ""Oh, I lived there previously and that's just how it is, you have to get used to it."" is really unacceptable to me. The residents and honestly everyone on campus pay too much money to just accept living with mice. In the \~2 weeks since we've been living in the dorms, at least every other day I am aware of a resident who sees a mouse in their room or catches one in a trap in their room. One resident in particular has caught SEVEN MICE in their room alone in the past week, and this is after the on campus exterminator made visits as well.

The absolute worse part is the response mechanism to handle this. I understand that after the flood the maintenance staff are overworked and short staffed. As far as I am concerned, this is an issue above them. If there is a maintenance emergency, more people should be hired short term to deliver the services we need on this campus and if you KNOW there is a mice infestation on campus you should hire at least a few on-call staff because no one should have to sleep with dead mice in their room from Friday evening to Monday morning... this poses a legitimate health and safety concern for residents in these halls. 

Ultimately, I'd like to see a legitimate extermination in these spaces over an extended break (boo-hoo if you can't house students there during Arch), dead mice everywhere is filthy, and the other concerns should be addressed in the meanwhile.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to budge the admin to address this issue, I'd love to hear them!",d03zu2,RPI

Anyone Else Move Into A Trashed Room?,84,23,"So I just moved into city station south. This is the first time I've moved into a dorm where it appears that nobody cleaned up after the former inhabitants. It usually wouldn't be a big deal I'd just clean it. However a.) I just moved in and I don't have cleaning supplies yet. b.) It's quite dirty. 

I know it's not there responsibility to clean the place for us but I thought they'd at least clean up after the last tenants. I really hope this is from Summer tenants and not from last Spring but judging from the smell I'm not so sure. It's full of junk, the fridge is full of run off from what looks like milk, soda, and food that's glued to the thing can hardly peel it off. The bathrooms and rooms are also full of junk, dust, and stains from who knows what. Both for school and out of school I'm used to apartments being at least clean if a little dusty when a new tenant moves in. I mean it's nothing a day spent cleaning won't take care of but I'm curious if this will become increasingly common due to the Summer semster or if it's just a stroke of bad luck.

Do the majority of people outside this sub at RPI actually approve of ARCH?,56,35,"I was leaving my dorm for the weekend when I realized I needed to get my keys from my room, so I had to get my RA to open the door. On the way there, she asked me how I enjoyed the summer semester so far, to which I told her that I didn’t like it very much nor did I like the idea of being at school during the summer.

She then gave me a very confused and worried look, and stopped talking to me. I was driving with my roommate on the way back home, and I told him this story, and he told me that I “sounded like a school shooter to her”.

I was dumbfounded. I asked him what about me saying the obvious - that I dislike going to school over the summer - was out of line and if he actually enjoyed going to school during the summer. He actually told me in response that he liked being at school during the summer in all honesty.

I get it, I know this is what we signed up for, but why are people acting like this is a good thing? We waste tons of internship opportunities during the summer, we have to deal with the stress of three consecutive semesters (four for the guys doing school this coming fall), heck, most of the international students won’t have enough time to go back home for the summer to see their families. And yet everywhere I go I see everyone enjoying themselves and making me out to be the crazy person for having a sentiment I thought, at least from this sub, was shared by everyone.

Stuff like this is why I truly feel alone at this college. Back in high school things were simple; if something was outright wrong and unfair, everyone I knew would at least acknowledge it’s wrong and unfair. At the very least, they’d have shown some negative emotion towards it.",c9r2gu,RPI

Switching residences for second semester,22,16,"So I’ve been living at upper res for my first semester and it’s really not for me.

I understand that the students who live here want to party and have fun, and I am not interested in shutting that down for them/complaining about it to anyone, I just am unhappy here and got a bit unlucky with my floor. 

I am not the most social, which is why I picked the single option in one of the cheaper dorms, but my grades are suffering and I partially blame it on hating where I live and being uncomfortable with my living situation. I spend all of my time around campus and in my friend’s dorms and usually leave my dorm as soon as I can in the morning and head back late at night, but I really would like to be able to spend more time in my room and have some friends in the building. I have not managed to meet many people which is not great, but I really have a problem with the lack of respect (the people on my floor at least) show to the shared bathrooms/ hallways and the staff in general. Again, I know that this is not exclusive to my dorm, but I am potentially willing to take a gamble on another residence. 

Anyways I am looking into moving, and I’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with moving out later in the year. Is it worth the hassle, or should I just pull through and get over it?

Advice For Choosing A Rez (First Year Student),7,32,"Hey everyone! I'm an incoming first year student and I'm super excited to attend McGill! I'm currently looking at different Rez options for first year students and I just wanted to pop on here for some help picking one out. For the record, I know that this is something that I shouldn't be concerned about yet but it's exactly -32(c) degrees right now, windy enough to topple our garbage bins, and I haven't been able to leave my house these past 2 days. So I've pretty much been thinking about nicer things, what I'm trying to find at McGill, and also possibly developing senioritis in the process because I want to get the *hell* out of here and explore Montréal.

&#x200B;

I looked over the Rez Masterpost and other posts about Rez (rez stereotypes, memes, etc.), so I have a general idea of what each Rez is like. Ideally, what I'd like to have is a dorm with a strong learning-oriented community, fun (not drinking-heavy) traditions, and good study places/practice rooms for non-music majors (if such a thing exists). I'm not into partying or drinking but I am into having dinner parties with friends, seeing a Montreal Symphony Orchestra concert, etc. Could anyone point me to a dorm that might fit my tastes?

&#x200B;

I have no preference over community stalls vs. private bathrooms, campus location (edit: I'm not ruling out Solin now), or the cafeterias, hence why I've been having a difficult time trying to pick out a few places from the rest. Since my preferences come down to the kinds of people each dorm normally attracts, the quality of the study rooms/accessibility of practice rooms, and the quirky traditions each dorm might have, I'm pretty much searching for as much advice I can get from people who've already been through Rez life/are currently in Rez. So yeah, any advice and cool stories will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Also, as much as I dislike that the food and dorms are wayyyy overpriced, I would feel a lot more comfortable in a dorm for my first year. Plus, even with the super overpriced stuff McGill is actually considerably cheaper than my 2nd choice school (America and overpriced tuition/housing! Yay!)

The catch all thread about McGill residences,31,54,"I'll make this quick and dirty. People can add if they want.

**The Hotels:** Named as such because they were all once hotels before McGill bought them. They are pretty much the same across the board except that New Rez's size makes it harder to control and thus more of a party residence. They each have 24/7 desks, security and turnstile and sign in guest policy. MOST of their rooms are doubles but if you're lucky enough to get one of the rare single, you'll have pretty sweet room for the rest of the year. But I stress that it's rare and since they are in such high demand, first priority is given to scholarship students. Most people living here will be sharing their room with a roommate which can be a bit weird and privacy can be a bit of a luxury in a hotel double. 

Some quirks:

* La Citadelle has the best meal plan; since it has no cafeteria McGill gives you a meal plan that is not limited by geography. New Rez and Carrefour Sherbooke both have meal plans limited to their home cafeterias and a limited number of dollars you can spend outside known as flex dollars.
* CS' cafeteria is probably the worst of all the McGill residences. Last year there was an outbreak of mono that many people suspected started from the CS cafe, that's how bad it is.
* CS is popular for music majors because it's right next to the music building. 
* Like I said before, New Rez has by far the most parties.

**Upper Rez:** Dorm style residence halls. Think of the traditional college experience.

To be honest with you. I don't know much about the culture of these residences. Molson seems to be the party rez but I don't know why. Gardner is popular with scholarship students (again, no idea why). Functionally, they are all pretty much the same. They can be a bit of a pain to get to because they are located on top of a steep hill which will be an issue in the winter. You'll probably end up meeting more people here than any other residence because the cafeteria is shared amongst all the students. There is no real security or guest policy like the hotels so it's a bit more loose and relaxed. One big con for a lot of girls: unisex shared bathrooms (with showers). It can get a bit nasty in there.

**MORE Houses:** This is a reference that will likely escape many of you since you're all young kids, but MORE houses are basically set up like MTV's The Real World or perhaps a more recent reality show, the Big Brother House (without the cameras and nice digs obviously). They are the cheapest residences but you're basically sharing a house with 15+ people and all the bedrooms are shared. In a house that big there will be some big clashes of personalities, it's inevitable. If you like privacy, neatness and quiet spaces to yourself, these residences will not work for you. You don't have to be a complete degenerate but you have to be able to tolerate a bit of messiness and shared spaces to really enjoy MORE Houses. I personally could not do it but that's just me.

**Greenbriar:** Technically a part of MORE Houses but it's very different setup so it deserves its own entry. Greenbriar prior to being bought by McGill was a regular high rise apartment and here's a fun fact for you; some of the residents from those days held on to their leases and continue to live there(both are old women now so don't worry about it being creepy pedos). Greenbriar like I already said is basically an apartment building so if you live here, you 'll get your own private bedroom. It's close to campus, (relatively) cheap. Because meal plans are optional, you do get a kitchen. Cons? Even though it's cheaper per month, you're on an 11 month lease (the other residences are on 8 month leases) so you're not actually saving that much money (although it's still significant if you don't buy a meal plan)

**RVC:** This is effectively the same dorm style as Upper Rez but with the advantage of being much closer to campus. Also popular with music kids because of its proximity to the music building. The cafeteria is considered one of the better ones in residences. It's also not staffed by Aramark employees (this is a good thing, trust me). 

**Solin Hall:** Simultaneously the most loved and hated residence. We get more requests for people to move out of Solin than any other residence, but the people who choose to stay have very positive experiences. Cons right off the bat, it's the furthest from campus (four metro stops), isolated, 11 month leases, people who hate it, REALLY HATE Solin. Pros: Nicest digs, people who like it, REALLY like Solin.

Douglas Hall questions,7,5,"Hey I'm a new student who got into Doug, and I have a short list of questions for anyone who's lived there before:

3. Is there a way to loft my bed and/or are students allowed to use bed-risers?
4. What are the policies about bringing visitors into the dorm? (like could I have a non-McGill friend stay the night?)
5. Are there toasters in the tunnel kitchen? I know I'm not allowed to bring a toaster, but I was just curious...

The catch all thread about McGill residences - 2014 Year,12,17,"Reposting this so that people can comment. Previous thread was too old, and had been archived.

>I'll make this quick and dirty. People can add if they want.

>The Hotels: Named as such because they were all once hotels before McGill bought them. They are pretty much the same across the board except that New Rez's size makes it harder to control and thus more of a party residence. They each have 24/7 desks, security and turnstile and sign in guest policy. MOST of their rooms are doubles but if you're lucky enough to get one of the rare single, you'll have pretty sweet room for the rest of the year. But I stress that it's rare and since they are in such high demand, first priority is given to scholarship students. Most people living here will be sharing their room with a roommate which can be a bit weird and privacy can be a bit of a luxury in a hotel double.

>Some quirks:

>* La Citadelle has the best meal plan; since it has no cafeteria McGill gives you a meal plan that is not limited by geography. New Rez and Carrefour Sherbooke both have meal plans limited to their home cafeterias and a limited number of dollars you can spend outside known as flex dollars.
>* CS' cafeteria is probably the worst of all the McGill residences. Last year there was an outbreak of mono that many people suspected started from the CS cafe, that's how bad it is.
>* CS is popular for music majors because it's right next to the music building.
>* Like I said before, New Rez has by far the most parties.

>* Upper Rez: Dorm style residence halls. Think of the traditional college experience.

>* To be honest with you. I don't know much about the culture of these residences. Molson seems to be the party rez but I don't know why. Gardner is popular with scholarship students (again, no idea why). Functionally, they are all pretty much the same. They can be a bit of a pain to get to because they are located on top of a steep hill which will be an issue in the winter. You'll probably end up meeting more people here than any other residence because the cafeteria is shared amongst all the students.

Double room at McGill,8,7,"I know rooming is mostly down to preferences, but I was curious: why do students at McGill generally prefer single rooms in their first year? I'm American and at most American colleges you have to have a double room so I immediately thought of applying for that, but I've been told of many bad experiences with double rooms and that it's not exactly a popular thing to want. Am I missing something? Did anyone have a double and what was it like? Would picking a double room for the dorm I want give me less of a chance of getting that dorm because there are less double rooms?

Thank you!",37y1hz,mcgill
Advice on the Residences?,4,28,"Hi all,

Graduating senior here, and I was fortunate enough to win a renewable entrance scholarship, and am garunteed my first residence choice.

How likely am I going to get a single in the hotels mainly Citadelle or New Rez?

I put the dorms next and then MORE houses last. But I am wondering what are the houses like? Would I like it I don't mind cooking. Should I raise the rank?

Any experiences with Citadelle, New Rez and More houses, please chime in! I ranked both citadelle and new rez single as my top 2 followed by their double options. Then all the singles of the dorms and last the remaining doubles. But I'm wondering if I should lower the rank of the hotel doubles too.

I really need my private study time and I'm not keen on a roomate as I've heard bad stories lol. I am studious, do not party (party as in alcohol and bars and clubs) . (I'm a girl) and I would not like some druggie roommate and am trying to get into med school.

"For the Freshmen class of 2014, a breakdown of the residence system",2,1,"Upper Rez aka: BMH - Dorm style residences. Functionally speaking, they are all the same and offer students the traditional aspects of college life. For some reason, Molson, year in and year out seems to garner the reputation for being the hardest partiers. This residence is located way up the hill and is quite isolated from your basic amenities. Security here is lax so you can get away with quite a bit. Molson used to have this giant beerbong that had a pipe that went down five floors. Dunno if it still exists but it used to be a bit of a tradition. 

New Rez - The biggest residence at McGill. It has a reputation for being wild and party hardy which is well deserved. This is basically a hotel which is good and bad. Good in that you get nice rooms and your close to all the amenities but bad in that you get little privacy in your room since most the beds are next to one another. In other words, expect to get sexed out (or be the one doing the sexing out) a lot. One year, New Rez had more than 50% of its students on academic probation. Year in and year out , has the highest number of one year wonders (kids who drop out after a year) at McGill. Why? Because it is understaffed, large and impossible to control. Lots of parties go on here on a nightly basis and it's very hard to study in that type of environment. If you are easily distracted and have issues folding to peer pressure, avoid this residence if you want to do well academically. Fun fact, when McGill first bought New Residence it was a 4 star hotel. Today it's a 2 star hotel. Seven years of 18 year olds abusing it on a nightly basis will do that to a building. 

Carrefour Sherbrooke - Functionally the same as New Rez. Pretty much the opposite of New Rez in culture. It has a reputation for being strict on rules and quiet and is not understaffed like New Rez. In fact, students often will come here to study. If you are a music student, this residence is especially convenient because the music building and library are right down the street. So the cons? This residence basically babysits you. Unlike the other residences where you're given quite a bit of free reign and some degree of respect as adults, this residence has strict regulations on noise, alcohol and imposes noise curfews on weeknights. 

RVC - Another residence that is convenient for music students because of it's proximity to the music buildings. RVC has dorm style rooms and is considered to have the best cafeteria on campus. Cons? No real cons; dorms are a bit small but you're not paying for awesome buildings if you're planning to live on campus. If that is the case, I wouldn't recommend a single one. 

MORE Houses - You know that TV show the Real World on MTV? The MORE Houses are basically that. A bunch of people in one house sharing it. For obvious reasons, this can create a lot of issues as a group that large sharing a house will have personalities that clash. Additionally, these residences are spread across campus and unlike the residences I've already mentioned - do not have ANY support staff on site. Could be a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about being supervised at 18. 

Greenbriar - Technically considered to be a part of MORE houses but it's different enough that it warrants its own entry. Basically an apartment building on campus. Like MORE houses, they are not supervised so depending on your floormates, it can be a wildcard. 

Prez Rez - I have very little info on this residence. Sorry.

Solin Hall - This is a love it or hate it residence. Quite unique in that it's located relatively far off campus - you have to take a bus, car or the metro (subway) to get to school. Because it's located so far off campus, you do not get a meal plan. Instead you get a kitchen and are expected to make food on your own. That said, in terms of living accommodations, this is the only residence that I would deem suitable for a normal human being to live in. Large living spaces, big windows, high ceilings, private bathrooms and private bedrooms make it very nice to live. The distance factor may turn you off however.",p1rjb,mcgill

Would I be able to stay in my housing for like a month at the beginning of the quarter and then get a partial refund or something?

Ideas for supporting the Hong Kong protests,50,20,"* With all of these, make sure to include information about the protests so that everyone is well informed and knows what's going on!
* If you live in the dorms:
   * Every morning and every night, write statements in support of the Hong Kong protests on your floor's whiteboard.
   * Tape printed signs in support of the Hong Kong protests (bonus points if you include images of Chinese police violence and of the peaceful protestors, including the woman whose eye was shot out by police and the man whose head was crushed into the cement.)
   * Get a pen (preferably washable, Crayola is a good brand for that) and write messages in support of the Hong Kong protests on the bathroom stalls.
   * Leave a big sign in your window in support of the Hong Kong protests. It's safer if you live on a higher floor, I wouldn't advise doing it if you live on the ground level.
* If you live in an apartment or house:
   * Leave a sign in support of the Hong Kong protests in your window(s). And don't just set them there--make sure that even if someone breaks in and tries to remove it, they'll have a really hard time doing it (use Elmer's glue perhaps?)
* If you have a front yard:
   * Post a sign in your yard that is in support of the Hong Kong protests. Show images of police violence and peaceful protest. Chances are people will try to remove, damage, or steal it. To prevent this:
      * make sure the sign is made of some sort of sturdy metal, like steel or aluminum. 
      * Coat the back of the sign and the stakes at the bottom with tree sap or something equally sticky. Any attempts to steal or remove the sign will result in extremely sticky hands, and if they try to put it in their car it will get all over their car!
      * If you can't get access to something sticky, vaseline will work and make the sign extra slippery so they can't get a good grip on it.
* If you have a roof:
   * Put a reaallyy big sign on your roof. It's really hard not to get caught climbing on someone else's roof to remove a giant sign, and even if they get the sign off, it would be too big for them to dispose of or steal without getting caught.
* Things you can do elsewhere:
   * Write things in support of Hong Kong protests using sidewalk chalk in areas around the dorms, in the street outside your apartment or house, and pretty much everywhere with cement on the ground. It's impossible to get rid of without hosing it down, and it won't go away until it rains, which--in California--doesn't happen often.
   * Say things like ""Stand for Hong Kong"" or ""support Hong Kong protests"" using duct tape on public boards and on walkways. Duct tape is extremely difficult to remove from flat surfaces without something to scrape it up or dissolve the adhesive.
   * Wear clothing in support of the Hong Kong protests, such as hats, shirts, shorts, jeans, dresses/skirts, pajamas, shoes, socks, anything really.
   * Put bumper stickers on your car or bike in support of the Hong Kong protests. Bumper stickers have extremely strong adhesive that is nearly impossible to remove.

The I am Aggie Saga (1/4),24,9,"When I think of saga, I think of Twilight. And honestly, I feel like my four years here at UC Davis and the amount of drama I've experienced here is pretty comparable to that in Twilight. I'm writing this to share my story.

I am currently a 4th year Psychology major. However, because this is Part 1, we will go all the way back to my itty bitty freshman self. 

I am the oldest child with 5 younger siblings. I always felt, and still feel, such a huge responsibility to be a role model for my siblings and to pave a path and encourage them in ways that I never really received because let's face it, I'm the trailblazer here. So, when I was in high school, I did everything possible to get into college: editor of the school's newspaper, ASB Vice President of the student council, second chairman in the baritone section of the school's marching band, Physic's Club President, award-winning MESA member, straight-A student.

I wanted to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. I wanted to study biology. UC Davis has one of the best biology programs in the nation. So honestly, I was pretty fucking stoked when I got my acceptance letter. It was one step towards my dreams coming true.

From my graduating class, there were quite a few of us who were going to attend UCD. Moving away from home and being in a new environment is scary enough, so I decided to room with a high school friend to make things a little bit easier for myself. That was the first big mistake that I made. And maybe it was just the dynamic of our relationship, but because of my experiences, I will forever recommend freshmen to bite the bullet and room with a stranger. Strangers are typically more considerate because they don't know you. They don't have the pre-notion of ""She's my friend, she'll be okay if I do this."" My roommate had a boyfriend from back home. Not saying that roommates with a significant other are a red flag, but definitely make the time to set boundaries. This was another mistake of mine. Because of that, there were many times I walked in on my roommate having sex. I've been sexiled. It's really not the funnest feeling, trust me when I say that.

Because of these issues with my roommate, we grew apart. And subsequently, I kind of grew apart from all of my high school friends who are UCD. At first, it made me really sad. But a hard pill to swallow is that it's okay to grow apart from friends. If anything, it's probably a positive thing for the both of you. Anyway, I tried avoiding my roommate at all costs. I had made a new group of friends (who I still keep close to today). Every morning, I would wake up at 7am to leave the dorm and would not return until 1-2am and go straight to sleep so that I didn't have to interact with my roommate. Consequently, my health suffered. I'm a person who gets frequent headaches and migraines already, but I remember popping Tylenol pills almost every single day. I also gained a lot of weight, about 40-50lbs. To say the least, I felt absolutely miserable.

To top it off, I wasn't the same straight A student I was in high school. I wasn't involved in a whole bunch of extracurricular activities. In fact, at the end of my freshman year, I feel like I lost myself. After winter quarter, I was Subject to Dismissal, and honestly, I was almost okay with it. Maybe college wasn't for me. Maybe I didn't really want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. Maybe I didn't really like science all that much. I felt like I was having an identity crisis. Maybe I was going to be one of those people who peaked in high school. Maybe I'm not as resilient as I thought I was. I felt so ashamed of my shortcomings and losing relationships that were once really meaningful to me. Yes, of course, I developed new relationships, but one thing you should know about me is I'm a pretty anxious person. Anxiety can do a lot of ugly damage. So yeah, back to my point, they let me stay. And I met my contract, and yeah here I still am. Also, let me just say that Tori Hollowell is the kindest BASC advisor you can get. Let me also say the Microbiology department, in general, have some of the nicest people in the College of BioSci.

At the end of my freshman year, I packed up all of my things from my dorm. Did not even say goodbye to my roommate. I left my checkbook inside one of the drawers, which I called Student Housing Services about, but they never called me back to give me back my checkbook. And that first chapter of my freshman year was done. It was over. And in September 2017, I'll be moving in with three new girls who seemed very promising. I was excited for a new start.",dm8jiv,ucdavis

Just need a place to vent,0,25,"First of all, fantasy football is one of the most addicting and time-consuming things I have ever done. Like many others, fantasy football takes us all away from Sunday brunch and Thursday/Monday night plans. As a fantasy football team owner, I have accepted that this is my main priority throughout my first semester of college. Tonight was a bad night, I watched my team lose by 1 point, if I could explain the frustration and disappointment I felt, your eyes would quickly shiver and shed a tear for me. Anyways, can someone explain to me the point of paying 25k freshman year to live in a dorm, surrounded by people who are not clean, leave the bathroom a mess, and have a terrible taste in music? I seriously think the only thing students are supposed to learn from freshman year is that living with someone sucks, you never have that lovely alone time that we all once took for granted in high school. Not one bit of this is because of my roommate, it is simply because I like to have space and this 5x5 room with cement as beds is a living hell. I just want to get to sophomore year where I can watch 2 hours of porn without hearing a noise. Is this that much to ask for? Honestly, what is the fucking point in college?

"Some random tips for freshmen to save time, money, and stress",87,43,"Feel free to add any

* If you know you want to join any clubs, do it asap. Most require you to sign up on the getinvolved page.

*   If you have an unlimited meal plan, you can utilize your weekly meal swipes to stock up on some food. If the week is ending soon and you have more than enough swipes, you can go get premade food at the atrium, pastries and drinks from PCJ, snacks from Jason's deli, etc. Great way to stock up on snacks and save some money. 
* Be mindful about how much of your meal plan you are using, they are rather expensive and you will get the chance to pick a new one next semester. I knew freshmen who changed to block 150 and didn't change their eating habits. Saved hundreds
* Mix up your eating. Don't get the same things from the dining hall every day. Don't eat the meatball sandwich from Jason's everyday. You will get sick of them quickly. Try the atrium, try the different dining halls, try tally. 
* If you are on a professional career track like premed, prelaw, etc: make sure to join the clubs so you are put on the listservs. There are great oppurtunities there and the Career Development Center offers walkins to discuss your plans. 
*   If possible, wait until after your first class to buy textbooks. Often textbooks are set above the professor and they will say something along the lines of ""it isn't really needed but is helpful."" 
* If you are in need of homework help and chegg keeps coming up in search results, it can be worth it to help you work through problems. Usually the numbers are different or it asks for a different variable, but it can be the jumpstart to get you to the solution. Especially true for chemistry courses
* Coursehero is never worth paying for, but you can use incognito sessions to reset their previews. Be aware that using it for numbers to plug into homework problems that you didn't solve yourself is cheating and pretty obvious.
* If you're going to drink in your dorm, keep it out of sight from any passerbys. When done, hide it well. Don't give any reason for an RA to come over and they generally won't. Really just don't be stupid or slip up and you will be fine. 
* It's best to get at least one (if not both) of your PE requirements out of the way your freshman year. Take it pass/fail as they usually grade rather strictly.
* Pick out a main way to exercise and stick to it. Walking to class actually burns a lot more than you think, but the food here makes up for that. Exercise doesn't have to be at the gym. Bike on the fantastic trails around campus, join intramurals or a club, etc. 
* Laundry can be pretty terrible, especially at certain dorms like Sullivan. Try to go at times when you think there will be the fewest people. Generally getting up early or staying up late to do it has the shortest waits. Weekends during the day are horrible. Laundryalert is useless at most dorms.
* Wolfpack outfitters is really expensive but has most emergency items  (along with the C-stores). 
* Get your flu shot around October. Usually student health gives them out for free if you ask. Last year a pretty nasty flu went around my residence hall and made a bunch of people sick over the winter break and finals. Germs spread like wildfire here so might as well be protected from some of it. 
* Call your parents",ctjj3d,ncsu

Freshman Dorm Suggestions,0,13,"As an incoming freshman, I'm starting to look for which dorms I'd like to try to get into. I just have a few questions about this.

How many choices do we put down when the room application opens up? 

I'm limited to dorms that have 24-hour Visitation Hours because I'll be having my girlfriend who's at another school stay with me occasionally (I already have a roommate planned so I don't need to worry about finding someone okay with this). That narrowed me down to about 5 dorms, Bragaw, Watauga, Carroll, Alexander, and Turlington. My roommate and I are looking for dorms that have food near, are near where most freshman classes are (if they even are in one area), and in a generally lively atmosphere. We're not huge party people but we're both trying to become a bit more outgoing so we want to have lots of opportunities to meet people right around us. We haven't made a solid decision on suite vs. hall, but we like the closer bathrooms for suites but we like the open layout of halls. 

Bragaw and Watauga seem like the best rooms for sure. Issues are that I've heard not many freshmen live in these halls and they're more laid back while we're looking for somewhere more fun. I might be wrong though, and if I am then I'd definitely consider going for one of these places (they might be hard to get into though.)

Alexander and Turlington both seem nice because of their location. I know Alexander is global village, and we'd be fine living with international students. Turlington is art village, and even though neither of us are art majors we think we'd enjoy the crowd in an art village. 

Carroll looks like it has small rooms and I don't like the 5-room layout but the location seems good.

Do you guys have any advice/suggestions for this?

Have you ever felt lonely on campus before? I’d love to hear your experiences,39,22,"Over this semester, I’ve had a fair number of conversations with a professor of mine about, generally speaking, about building social relationships on campus. Part of this was fueled by my own sense of loneliness; I’ve struggled with paralyzing levels of social anxiety that makes it hard to function in unfamiliar social situations, so I’ve tended to shy away from them even though I know it would be in my best interest to form social connections during my time as a student here. However, what also struck me was how he claimed a lot of people on campus knew how I felt, how they felt just as lonely as I did. It felt tragic, that there were so many lonely people on campus who would love to meet others who could understand how they felt, but no clear avenue to meet them.

I know how I’ve handled this sense of loneliness in the past: I retreated to the Internet. For me, it was a way I could interact with people without taking in too much stimuli that overwhelmed me in face-to-face scenarios. I only had to react to somebody’s written words, and when I felt comfortable enough to voice-chat with somebody, their voice. I felt comfortable expressing my inner thoughts, my fears and insecurities, when I was able to hide behind a computer screen. In person, I was too afraid to break through the walls of empty platitudes that my professor calls “autistic friendliness” (a rigid predisposition to be friendly; personally not the biggest fan of the term). I’ve made some amazing friends, several of whom I’ve had the pleasure of meeting in real life despite living states apart, and who I love like siblings.

But in real life, all I can do is pretend to smile and be polite when I meet somebody new. The fear of rejection is so strong, I use “autistic friendliness” as a shield. What if somebody thinks I’m pathetic for being such a social loser? What if somebody thinks I’m not desirable as a friend? As much as I love my online family, I need to find healthy offline relationships as well. I know a lot of people on campus would relate to my experiences. I remember being able to have a conversation about this with somebody one time, who confessed they wished they could wear a big “talk to me” sign on campus because they felt the same way.

I’m curious if there’s anybody here on this subreddit who’s felt similarly or has had similar experiences on campus. I know how hard it is to be able to express this offline, but I hope asking this online may give some people the courage to answer more honestly. I hope hearing others who feel the same way can help both others, and myself, find confidence.",bebvhc,ncsu

Housing Guide for Freshman,40,18,"I've been seeing quite a few posts from incoming freshman about the pros and cons of living in different places around campus so I figured I would write a little guide based on my own personal experience. I'm only familiar with the major residence halls in central/west campus so other current students, please feel free to cover anything I missed in the comments.

Suite Style Dormitories:

Bragaw- This dorm is known as the alpha dorm because of its room size and location. It is right between Sullivan/Lee and the Tri-Towers, which makes it closer to main-campus than Sullivan/Lee and closer to Fountain than the Tri-Towers. The room sizes are easily the biggest with more than enough room to walk around in. Common rooms are centralized, so everyone in Bragaw uses the same ones. The two keys you receive open the suite and your room, which means you don't need a key for the bathroom. The biggest warning I have for people wanting to live in Bragaw is that the rooms are dank (the bad dank). I know lots of people who got really sick (pneumonia or flu) due to roaches and humidity. Therefore I'd definitely recommend installing a dehumidifier and roach traps in the room. Eight people share one bathroom, which has one shower and two stalls. It is easiest to get in through applying for eco-village.

Sullivan/Lee- These dorms are located in the far west area of main-campus, meaning a 6-8 minute walk to get to the Free Expression Tunnel and Talley. The rooms seem to be a little bit bigger than in Tri-Towers, but are still smaller than Bragaw. One of the biggest pros over both the Tri-Towers and Bragaw is that they have a common room with a kitchen on every other floor, something to value if you like cooking your own food. The two keys that you get to live there open your suite and your room, which means you don't need a key for the bathroom. These dorms are right next to Fountain Dining Hall. Eight people share one bathroom, which has one shower and two stalls. Sullivan is said to be the new home of the Engineering Village.

Tri-Towers(Bowen, Metcalf, Carrol)- These dorms are located in the heart of campus and are where I stayed freshman year. Their location is the biggest pro and outweighs many of the cons living here. Tri-Towers are the closest of these dorms to main-campus, meaning you are closest to Talley, Case (the legendary dining hall), Carmichael gym, and your classes while still being close to Fountain. The rooms are the smallest of the suite style halls; however, it is still easy to get a futon in and get a decent living situation going. These dorms are the best maintained. Ten people share a bathroom so two showers and two stalls. Now for the cons. There is only one common room at the bottom of the towers. Lots of people on Reddit say it feels like being in jail and I definitely get that vibe sometimes (depending on how depressed I'm feeling, lol). The two keys you get are for your bathroom and your room WHICH IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING, whether it's having guests over or just having to use the bathroom.

Hall Style Dormitories:

Tucker/Owen- These dorms are located right in front of the Tri-Towers and are on the same quad/volleyball court, so they share the same locational pros. The rooms are around the same size as Sullivan/Lee AND HAVE A SINK. That fact alone makes me wish I considered hall-style at NC State. The biggest thing people hold against hall style is having to share a bathroom with a whole hall, but from what I've heard it is not a big deal whatsoever. Shower availability is not a problem. It is also very easy to meet lots of new people in hall style, especially during that first-week college buzz.

I hope this helps anyone with questions and I wish everyone luck on their endeavors here at state. Go Pack!

P.S. Be as active and social as you can that first week! College has the stereotype of a place where you make tons of friends and while that's true, cliques/friend groups form very fast.

"The dreaded ""where should I dorm"" post",5,22,"I know there have been several of these already in this sub, but none of them really fit my specific needs. I'm an incoming (hopefully, find out in a week) freshman to the College of Engineering. I have a preferred roommate (both of us CompSci), and we both are quiet and are not interested in parties. So, i'm willing to sacrifice convenience for peacefulness. I know every college dorm is rowdy but I figure there are some less vibrant than others. I'd rather not do a suite, but if it is necessary then fine. 

So, taking in all of that, i've gathered that Avent Ferry is the best for me. According to other posts, freshmen frequently get assigned there too. Is that my best bet?

Really appreciate any input you can give, thank you all!

Bathroom Situation in Hall vs. Suite?,11,19,"Hey guys!

I'm an incoming Freshman here at NC State, and I'm trying to decide on housing. 

At first I thought my top choices would be:
Bragaw, Bowen, and Carroll.

I chose these because people have said that they liked suite style, and the rooms were nice. 

However, I've recently heard from others saying that the rooms in hall style dorms like Alexander or Owen are much better. I took a 3D Tour of both Bowen and Owen, and the rooms in Owen did look a lot better to me. 

One issue I have is the bathroom situation. Some have said that despite having 4 showers for 30 people, they never had an issue with having to wait to shower or anything. What is everyone's experience?

Another possible housing list was:
Owen, Alexander, and Carroll.

I have a lot of friends that already go there and I have no trouble making new friends so I'm not really looking for the ""freshman experience"" and all that. I just want to do good academically. I also like making my own food and budgeting myself, which you can't do in a dorm. I know I can be cheaper and healthier than any meal plan. 

Anyone that lived off campus have any thoughts/ideas/suggestions? Are there off campus living communities for pre-professional school students? Are there any relatively cheap options?

Dorm preference?,1,2,"Hi everybody, I’m going to be a freshman next year and I’m curious about how the dorm preference works from your experience.

If that’s the case, I managed to make it in the low end of 100! I put my preference as pioneer and I found a roommate. I started that “invite to group” thing or whatever it’s called, so I feel like the dorm preference should go to my number. I’m not sure if her too preference is pioneer, but should it matter if I started the group?
One other question, is UMN good at sticking to students chosen roommates if they find them before hand? It would suck to plan everything out and not end up living with them.

how the hell do i make friends?,103,48,"i made the mistake of living in an apartment rather than in a dorm for freshman year, and now we’re only two months in and i hate my life. i had a really shitty welcome week group so i didn’t make friends from that, and i was too scared to go to clubs at the beginning of the year so i feel like my chance is gone. 

i haven’t made a single friend since i got here - i talk to a few people in my classes, but only because we sit next to one another, and we don’t have anything in common or any desire to hang out outside of class. the people i already knew here, including the people i live with, have turned out to be really shitty friends. 

i wanna go to clubs, but i’m really scared to go alone because nobody will talk to me and i’m awful at initiating conversations, and since it’s two months in, i feel like i already missed my chance. 

everyone else here has their whole friend groups already, all of my high school friends are having the time of their lives at school, and all i do is sit in my room because i have nothing to do and no friends. it feels (and is) so pathetic, but i genuinely don’t know what to do about it. did anyone have a similar situation, and now has some advice? please help :(",dn039h,uofmn

To all the lonely freshmen,141,20,"I’m sure a few of you are probably feeling isolated and alone, especially if you’re not a very outgoing person. I just want to let you know, as someone who’s been through the freshman year blues, that you’re not the only one feeling this way, and you won’t feel this way forever.

I don’t know how to put this into words, so I’m just going to share my personal experience from when I was a freshman. I had the same friend group for most of my life before I went to college, literally from Kindergarten through Senior Year. When I moved to college, obviously I had to start over, as almost none of my friends went here. It was hard for me, because my friend group had developed a shared sense of humor that I thought was kind of exclusive to us (I learned that’s not true). I felt intimidated by all of these people who had already made such good friends with each other within the first few weeks of school, and I only really hung out with my roommate at the time. I felt like there was something wrong with me, since I didn’t have all these friends and I didn’t go to parties or anything. For the first few months of school, I sat in my dorm room and cried almost every day, and it was hard making it through day to day when I was feeling so isolated from everything.

I’m not going to lie, those were the worst months of my life. But I got through it, and so can you.

After about Thanksgiving Break, I casually started talking to a group of guys down the hall from me. It was really hard putting myself out there, but it turned out we had a lot more in common than I realized. They are now my roommates, and I love them very much.

I know you’ve heard it a thousand times already, but you need to put yourself out there. Even if it’s just something like complimenting a band t-shirt that someone is wearing, it could spark a friendship that lasts the rest of your college experience. Yes, you’re going to have some embarrassing experiences, but I promise you it’s worth it. Getting invested in clubs also works wonders, since you already have whatever the subject is in common.

But in the meantime, since you might be struggling, you’re not alone. I haven’t met a single person that hasn’t told me that their 1st semester freshman year was awful. A lot of people are struggling, and that’s ok. You’re all going to come out of this a stronger person.

This whole thing might come out super sappy or some shit, but I’m writing this because I wish someone had told me this stuff when I was going through this experience. If you already have friends at college, that’s fantastic, but for the rest of you, you’ll get through this. It will just take some time and a little effort.

Hiring SLO Students for Live-in Care Assistant Position ($15/hr),148,9,"	Hey there, my name is Alex and I'm an incoming transfer student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at SLO. I'm writing this ad because I'm a bit different from your average student. I became tetraplegic after an accident while hiking in 2012. This delayed my education a little bit and I'm a few years older than the average student but I've had more time to figure out my priorities in life. Now that my first quarter at SLO is set to begin in Fall 2019, I need to hire one or two live-in personal care assistants (PCA) to help me.


	Your tasks would be helping me do some things that I can't. These include some basic things like getting me dressed, helping me shower and homemaking where you'd do normal meal-prepping, organizing, cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry etc. There are also some para-medical tasks involved like transferring me in and out of my wheelchair/bed, organizing my medicine, range of motion, bowel program, urinary catheter care etc. All necessary training will be provided and paid for. I have a detailed step-by-step of my planned morning and evening routines available upon request.


	As I'm a full-time student, I will primarily need help in the morning and evening so the rest of your day would be completely free to do as you wish. I'm also extremely flexible and adaptable. If you have any other responsibilities, like another job, that may require you to help me earlier or later than usual then please feel free to bring it up because I am more than willing to accommodate when possible. I require assistance all seven days of the week so I'm looking to split this between two people unless one person is both willing and able to take on that responsibility. A hypothetical school-day schedule would be from 6 AM to 8 AM and from 7 PM to 10 PM. Weekends will be more flexible but have more homemaking tasks assigned. Just in case you'd like to know, I only have classes Monday through Thursday in the Fall quarter. 


	The major crux of this job is that I need you to live in with me at my apartment on campus in Cerro Vista. In exchange though there are two very nice perks I can offer. Firstly, the Disability Resource Center on campus will provide anybody helping me with priority registration for all their classes at SLO. This means you'd be first in line for all your class choices for the duration of your employment. Secondly, SLO Campus Housing gave me an entire four bedroom apartment to myself so by living in with me, you would have a lot more peace and quiet than if you were to live in another dorm. If you are already assigned another dorm room, Housing can easily change it for you and you've also already satisfied the next paragraph.


	For legal reasons, Housing has told me to state in this ad that you'd be responsible for paying your own Housing fees separately and I quote ""You may be required to participate in a background check. As a resident of University Housing, the PCA will be required to follow all University Housing policies, guidelines, including the Community Rights as outlined in the University Housing Handbook, and have an active Housing Agreement/License with University Housing.""


	If you would like a general idea of what a tetraplegic's morning routine would look like, I found a great video on YouTube titled “Quadriplegic Bowel Program and Morning Routine.""

https://youtu.be/shidad_QR6I

	I have the same disability as the person in the video so my routine is similar but mine has differences that make it much easier. I have an electric lift to transfer me in and out of my wheelchair/bed. This lift makes it take much less effort than depicted in the video. My bowel program much faster than the ~45 minutes it takes in the video and my catheter requires less maintenance. I also use a power wheelchair instead of manual wheelchair.


	Compensation is $15.00 an hour and I'll need help around five hours a day. Any money spent my behalf, like grocery shopping, will be reimbursed immediately but you must provide a receipt. You'd be responsible for logging your own hours. I'd like to interview through Skype/FaceTime and if everything works out, begin training a few days before September 14 so please be available.


	if you're interested, I welcome you to contact me at fungalexander@yahoo.com I'm very enthusiastic and open about answering any and all questions you have big or small.",cv57d8,CalPoly

Swap from a triple in Sierra Madre to a quad in Yakitutu?,3,3,"Hello!

I am an incoming CPE major who at the time of his housing appointment only had the choice of choosing triples in Sierra Madre since all of the doubles were filled.

I submitted a room change request and now I have the opportunity to move into a quad in the Yakitutu building *tsɨtkawayu* which has a college-based theme for the college of science and math.

For those who have seen both triples in Sierra Madre and Quads in Yakitutu, is worth switching over? I know that quads in yakitutu are huge and newer than triples in SM, but will I miss out on certain aspects of social life for which the towers are known for? Would it really affect me if I choose to live a college-based community different than the one I am in (me being in CENG and *tsɨtkawayu* being CSM people.)

Transferring for Architectural Engineering (CPP to CPSLO),1,1,"**Hey guys.** I honestly thought I was completely done thinking about the possibility of ever attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, but a lot has been going through my mind recently and I just thought I'd look for a little guidance here *~~(rather than at the glorified meme Reddit over at~~* r/CalPolyPomona *~~)~~*. I am currently an incoming Freshman at Cal Poly Pomona, and I just registered for classes and everything over there so now I have three weeks before I actually move in and get started. **Not going to Cal Poly Pomona at all stopped being an option when I paid $150 for the overnight orientation and filed my loan applications... and bought all of the stuff for my dorm.** Anyways, I was thinking about the major that I chose. There has never been a doubt in my mind that I wanted to do something in the field of architecture, and I am majoring in Architecture over at Cal Poly Pomona. 

Now is the part where all the questions come. I am definitely more of a math-oriented individual, so architectural engineering seems like the more natural path for me to take. However, Cal Poly Pomona doesn't offer this major. I would be surprised if they did, as most of their professors are adjunct in architecture... **I was thinking about transferring after second year to an entirely different major that isn't offered at Cal Poly Pomona: Architecture to Architectural Engineering.** The only problem with that is that **I don't know if I can.** Most of the courses that I am taking are CSU transferable, but a lot of the architecture courses that I'm taking aren't. **I'm really wondering if I would even be able to transfer, or if you have ever heard of such a thing?** I'm sorry, this is a lot to read. ~~If you've gotten this far, you can stop reading because the rest of this is probably going to be a bunch of stuff that I have rattling around in my head.~~ 

**I've already formed a lot of relationships at Cal Poly, Pomona** and obviously will form a lot more. It would be harder to leave those, but honestly I think **it's worth it if I'm going to be in a major that I** ***might*** **like more.** **But that's another thing, I don't even know if I** ***won't*** **like architecture.** I'm really just nervous that I won't like it and completely sure that I would like the alternative and that scares me a bit. I almost feel like I chose the wrong major sometimes. Obviously I'll have to stick with it for now, and see about the possibility of transferring later. Anyways, I'll drop a **TL;DR at the bottom of this**, but if you have read *this entire thing*, congrats.

For new people living in the dorms this year: you don't need to install Safeconnect and antivirus to use the network,56,14,"UCSC tries to make you install a program called Safeconnect to connect to reswifi or the ethernet ports in the dorms. It collects a bunch of information about your computer, but privacy concerns aside, it's just annoying. You're required to install an antivirus program from an approved list, which is pretty short, and doesn't include Windows Defender. 

You can avoid using Safeconnect pretty easily, and I strongly recommend it:

* install a user agent switcher extension in your browser (like [this one](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-revived/) for Firefox or [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/dbclpoekepcmadpkeaelmhiheolhjflj?hl=en) for Chrome/Chromium derivatives).

* Connect to the resnet network, and when it asks you to login/check compliance, click the extension button and use it to change your user agent to ""Firefox on Ubuntu"". This ""tricks"" the webpage into thinking you're running Ubuntu, which they don't distribute Safeconnect for. Therefore, it lets you login without the safeconnect/antivirus check. You can force it to redirect you to the login page by navigating to a website that doesn't use SSL, like [neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com).

* refresh the page and login with your UCSC credentials. 

* once logged in, change your user agent back to default. 

* browse the internet as normal, and use whatever antivirus setup you please.",d7tawt,ucsc

Wireless printer in dorms?,2,11,"The UCSC list of recommended items includes a printer. 

We have a wireless printer that we can bring. However, the way it works is that it’s basically visible to anyone on the WiFi network it’s on and anyone can print on it. The usual solution would be a small WiFi network for just the dorm room, e.g. using a WiFi router in the room. Then only the people in the room would see the printer when they’re on that WiFi network.

However, College 9/10 is WiFi-only with UCSC ResNet, and they say personal routers are not allowed. How do people use wireless printers in the dorms with only ResNet WiFi, a huge shared WiFi network? Would your own printer be visible to everyone? When you go to print on your iPad, do you see tons of other people’s wireless printers in the dorm on AirPrint? Or is there some way to manage that?

Small group of people being loud in the dorm hallway every night.,24,15,"Here i lie, soft blue lights permeating along my white walls, trills of bird songs outside with the ocassional raven. It is around the time of sunrise, 6am, and i am stretching my legs out. Every now and then there is a coarse shriek from a girl down the hall. That, or a lighthearted and loud laughter. Sometimes it is accompanied with the back laughter of one or two other girls. There are also the voices of two males, whose vocal energies seem to directly correspond with how loud the female shrieks and laughs are. Again. Another booming laugh. And scream. Yeah, the screams and shrieks are a thing. Their loud personalities are in effect mainly from 1am to a little past sunrise.  
Sometimes i would listen to their loud talks of being new to cannabis, being wine-drunk versus a different drunk, and other various talk of the like. It reminds me of when i began drinking liquor and smoking pot with my bro group. More often than not, however, i am able to distance my mind from and enter mindless sleep with the help of earplugs. The earplugs can get quite numbing after an hour or two, and i would remove them just for comfort reasons. And after nodding back to sleep, I am met by a loud scream and laugh. At this point i just feel disappointment. This cycle continues throughout the night and morning.  
My disappointment and distancing from these people who treat the hallspace as a socializing place in the mid morning cannot be overstated. How abrasive can you get? What is your lifestyle like that you have to project loudness in the morning? I am physically replused by this small niche's abrasiveness that it is a wonder i can take their disturbances non personally half the time. But it is personal in a lot of ways, considering that my sleep schedule has been raped.  
I am going back to bed, my eyes are getting tired again and i feel guilty that i have been triggered.

How to handle people blasting bass in the dorms?,26,11,"The room next to me blasts bass-heavy rap music at least once or twice a weekday.

Today right when it started I walked up to their door and told them to turn it down. They complied. It has not even been thirty minutes and the bass is cranked up again.

I hate being a bass-police, but I view it more as being a nuisance-killer.

Picture this: here i am, in a single, enjoying my time off from classes trying to read, meditate, watch game of thrones, beat off, etc., and these dudes are blasting their woofers off and meanwhile, somewhere, the house's RA is asleep somewhere or drinking. One time I went up to these guys and had to explain that low-frequency wavelengths have lower attenuation rates so by them cranking the bass up, they make it impossible for even earplugs to block the sound and that the bass will travel through literally every single room of a single floor. Well that was too logical and not threatening enough I guess. Not to sound like I belong on /r/iamverysmart, but man, living on campus annoys me sometimes. If any fellow intellectuals can emphasize with me I would feel better.

I'm not entitled to my lifestyle any more than they are, but at least I don't physically push my environment into theirs via pressure waves.

Any good practical and non-passive advice is appreciated, mainly because being an early riser nerdy bass-cop against a handful of loud night owls is not really the best thing for one's mental health. If I do end up approaching these guys later tonight, I will update the thread.

Roommate peed on dorm floor,18,20,"I’m in the cowell dorms and a couple of months ago during the ~excitement~ of entering college life, my roommate came back to our room sooo black out drunk and he pissed himself in his sleep.... on our floor. My other, non pisser, roommate and I were understandably grossed out and kinda mad because he didn’t tell us that he pissed himself until the next day, after we’ve been walking around bare foot in our room. After failed clean up, a stain remains.

Has anyone else gotten these weird SETS questions?,86,8,"I was wondering if anyone else has had the same experience I had with one of their SETS surveys. After a while of doing my surveys, I got to my favorite professor, who I wanted to leave a good review for. My browser stopped responding for a few seconds once I clicked the link, until a question showed up at the top left corner of the page. I thought that the CSS hadn't loaded or something, so I reloaded the survey, which did nothing. The question itself was pretty weird: *""What is your current desire to lock your window?""*

There were a list of check-circles ranging from 1-10. At first I thought it was a late Halloween prank from our professor or something. I answered ""2"" (I live on the 5th floor of the dorms) and moved on to the next question, which took a while to scroll down since they seemed to be separated by absurdly large amounts of white space. Anyway, the next question went like this, with a box for answers underneath: *""What is the sharpest object in your room?""*

I thought that the school had accidentally switched the survey with some kind of hunting quiz or something, so i kept scrolling down to collect potential hints on what caused the bug. As I scrolled down, a black gradient started to appear on the survey. I saved a few of the questions that really caught my attention, I guess so that the admins could figure out where the questions were coming from:

*""If you were unknowingly ingesting large quantities of Aspirin for a week and suddenly stopped, would you notice any symptoms?*

*""If you were to fall from the Science Hill bridge, what sound would you make upon hitting the bottom?""*

I didn't think any survey would ask things this weird. The further I scrolled down the page, the more black it got, to the point where I had to highlight the text to make out what it was saying. The questions got more and more bizarre and hypothetical:

*""You are in bed, watching coverage of a fire in your city. You realize that the building on fire is actually your apartment complex. The news crew notices a man still in the building, in what appears to be your apartment. Upon zooming in, they reveal an exact copy of yourself, standing completely still in your living room. You hear a low murmuring from outside your bedroom door. What do you do?""*

*""You are at a theme park riding a roller coaster with your friends, when the ride enters a tunnel. After a few seconds in  pitch black, you think that the coaster should have exited the tunnel by then. After a bit longer, you reach to your right and feel nothing where your friend should be. The screams surrounding you are getting louder. Do you live like this forever or try unbuckling your seat belt?""*

*""You awake in a state of sleep paralysis to see a dark figure standing in your closet. After seven seconds, your motion sensor light turns on to reveal Professor (...) standing motionless in your closet. You realize that you are awake and still unable to move.""*

That last one wasn't even a question. The (...) was the actual last name of the professor I was doing the survey for, which I won't reveal in case this is some weird bug. I'm at the point on the site where the entire page is pitch black. The questions have lost all meaning, most of them not even resembling sentences. There was one warning me to lock my window, another telling me not to talk to my RA.

I hadn't even noticed until now, but it's completely dark outside my room at 3PM. I can usually see the forest at night, but it's pitch black, like someone rolled a cover over my window. The branch that's always scratching my window keeps getting louder, but I think it's just my imagination. Anyway, I hope this info helps the admins figure out what's going on and fix the bug.

why is everyone so mean spirited now,58,25,"I wanted to come here because I was told everyone was more open minded and nicer. What I got was people being elitist or just hostile, snapping at each other at a moments notice with ""gotchas"" and treating people they believe are lesser like garbage for even the tiniest mistakes.

I have been blatantly racially discriminated against 3 times this quarter, one of them I was almost jumped during what i thought was a fucking date. Another was with an international student who was super friendly when I first met her then it she went ice cold when I mentioned I wasnt white. she asked about a hobby I was pursuing and cut the conversation off immediately when my hobby was mexican culture and history.

I made friends with some people but then one got all weird when i said I went out partying, and was told to my face that ""drinking and partying isnt what good people do"" and insinuating i am also stupider for partying during a conversation joking about how we are so goody goody we dont even break traffic laws and now its unbearable to hang out with them because one person has hangups and acts hostile or plain passive aggressive. 

I try to make other friends but everyone else is so anti social they push others away, especially in merrill where everyone just stays in the dorms and dont even say hello. The RA events are empty and when they do happen no one even talks to each other they just head into separate parts of the room. I mean bless the RA's heart she tried to foster a conversation between floor mates but its mostly dead silence and the only conversation was when friends of the RA showed up after everyone else left.

its getting so bad I may have to switch from a BS to a BA just so I can leave sooner and go back home where I belong.

"$1,612 per month, but apparently no wifi?",26,6,"I'm up in the Crown dorms, and a router has been down on my floor for about a week now. This means basically half of the floor has nonexistent wifi. I created a Tech Support ticket, but apparently because our wifi is 'Eduroam' and not 'Resnet', they said "" Eduroam is intended for academic services, and thus, not guaranteed in residential locations.""

WTF is this shit? Eduroam is standard in Crown dorms, and the wifi was working fine earlier this quarter. Apparently they can't be bothered to fix it because the university says it never owed it to us in the first place. ITS Services told us to buy a router, but it seems infuriating that the university is asking me to spend money on something that they should already provide.

On Locked Stalls and How NOT to Check For Them,120,24,"This is for my Porter A 5th Floor Gaming peeps, but I’m sure others have experienced this as well.

I get it. You’re in your dorm when your body decides to be a sneaky lil shit and send a giant Nova Bomb barreling down your back end. You rush to bathroom, desperate for any sense of relief. But some of the stalls are locked! You’ve got to find that one stall that’s open!

We’ve all been there. It sucks. But please, for the love of the Traveler’s Light, do not POUND on the stall doors! 

What you SHOULD do is gently push on them with a single finger. Even the slightest touch will tell you if the stall is locked. I do it all the time. Be sneaky. Like, Hunter sneaky.

What you SHOULD NOT do is shoulder charge that stall door like a Cursed Thrall, violently shaking it in its lock and about giving me a heart attack while I’m trying to piss.

Unfortunately, his condition caused him to deteriorate very fast and he won't do Chemotherapy. My mom flew back up to take him back down to Florida to spend his resting days down there. But the reason why I am staying up here is I want to finish my undergrad for him as he LOVED UCONN and had nothing but great things to say about the school.

"Reminder: ""Winter Help"" wanted is a SCAM run by Vector Marketing. 99% of those who work with them lose money. Tear down their posters when you see them.",180,15,"Vector Marketing is a multi-level marketing scheme, i.e. pyramid scheme. They've returned to our campus again, and are posting in most classroom buildings, even Babbidge. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Marketing.

# TLDR: Vector Marketing / ""Winter Help Wanted"" is a scam, tear down their posters and tell your friends.

Some things to know about working with Vector:

1. You won't be an employee, you will be a [contractor](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/the-difference-between-an-independent-contractor-and-an-employee). This means **you do not earn an hourly wage**, this means **you do not have the same legal protections given to employees**, and this means **it is easier for them to exploit you.**

2. The knives they will have you selling are of sub-par quality. You can get much better knives for a lower cost.

3. Most people *lose* money when they work with Vector. It is literally worse than not having a job.

Other things to know:

**Boomer Astro-turfing:** When they are mentioned in Buy or Sell, they mass-report the post to try and get it taken down, and greatly astroturf the post. A few years back they installed a bunch of non-UConn students to talk up Vector (not realizing that, being new users, they'd have a ""handwave"" icon next to their name...) If you see someone defending Vector, chances are they're a boomer.

**Those posters:** Did you know you can tear down most posters on the UConn campus? (Exceptions include the Union, peoples dorms and offices, etc.) People do it all the time with political posters they don't like. I don't think we should be tearing down legitimate posters by UConn organizations, ***but absolutely feel free to tear down Vector Marketing posters.***

**The classroom:** You ever have someone come to your class before it starts to try to get you to join Vector? Ever see them write their URL on the board? That's shady as fuck isn't it?

**They aren't the only one!** Ever have someone from your highschool try to sell you essential oils? Ever have some stranger cold-call you on Facebook, insulting you and asking you to buy our makeup? There are hella other **multi-level marketing** companies that operate on the same principle. Shout-out to /r/antiMLM, you can check them out for more info.",dyqjfa,UCONN

\- Can exchange students join student clubs? If so are there any you guys recommend?

\- I have heard all about greek life and it seems kind of similar to the student club life here in Amsterdam. Is it possible to join a fraternity if you are only there one semester or is it possible to join their activities some other way? Do you guys recommend any particular fraternities? 

\- Is it easy to obtain tickets to your athletic team's games (Basketball, Ice Hockey, Football etc.)? When is the best time to buy them?

\- I found that there were multiple dorms on Uconn. Which dorms/houses are the best/most fun and why? Also do you recommend sleeping with a roommate or on your own? Just wondering what your experiences are.

First floor dorms in West Campus,5,7,"I’m thinking about where to live next semester (on campus). I’m currently a junior with senior standing (95 credits as of the end of last semester).

Does anybody have any more information on these rooms? Are they actually doubles?

**Tiger Cash vs. Paw Points**

Both are currency LSU uses. Both are used mostly to purchase meals in dining areas but can also be used to buy things from campus stores like The Take 5 or 459 Outakes. The difference is that Tiger Cash rolls over to the next semester whereas Paw Points don't. You can see people frantically buying everyone meals at the end of the semester just so they don't waste all of the Paw Points they have left. You can reload Tiger Cash through kiosks around campus but I mainly use the one in the Union next to McDonald's. Tiger Cash can be used off campus in some fast food restaurants that allow it and can be used to pay for printer use in Middleton.

&#x200B;

**Will I have time to go out if I'm a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ major?**

Yes, the first semester is a lot of introductory classes that require minimal thinking. I am a Biochem/Psych double major and I went out almost twice a week and still managed to make the Dean's List. Now don't get me wrong I did study my ass off but I developed time management skills and turned out fine. My second semester was rough though and I tried to pick up my pace more so I ended up only going out about 4 times the whole semester, but the first semester I would say anyone can go out no matter the major. For every semester after the first its mostly every STEM major goes out once a week on the weekends, but if your business or mass comm or etc. you can pretty much go out as much as you want from what I've seen.

&#x200B;

**What is the best bar?**

For freshman its usually Reggies. As a Reggie rat, I have spent many of evenings my first semester there. Other than that I would personally go to Mikes or Fred's. Freds is the only bar in Tigerland with an age limit above 18. I think girls is 19 and guys is 20 if I'm not mistaken so you would probably need a fake to get in.

&#x200B;

**Will I do good if I got \_\_\_\_ ACT score and I'm 5'9"" and blah blah blah?**

Its all about time management and prioritizing. College is not that difficult if you are able to develop a new way to study/ do work. A lot of people make study groups when first coming in and trust me they barely work. Most of mine ended up making jokes the entire time or showing each other irrelevant videos. I ended up only working/studying in a group of people if it was for math or chemistry. Every other class I would study independently and I turned out fine. Most people that I know of study in 1st/2nd floor Middleton, 1st floor Union, or in the study rooms in their dorms. I wasn't in the Honors College my first semester but managed to sneak into Laville and study in the study rooms. There were a lot of people that I had classes with that lived there so they were nice enough to help me out with studying.

&#x200B;

**Tiger Lagniappe**

Tiger lagniappe is an incentive thing where every month if you use Tiger Cash at a location you get a good deal. I would regularly use these because I didn't have any pawprints and you could basically always get two for one deal in the Union or the Faculty Club

&#x200B;

**Free meals**

A lot of churches around campus offer free meals once a week. Use these to your advantage.

&#x200B;

**Where do I get a ""clicker""**

Depending on what classes you get, some professors will require a clicker which is basically an answering machine. These are about 30 dollars and are at the Bookstore. If you don't have one for a class that says it's mandatory then your basically screwed because professors that have them usually use them to count attendance/class participation grades.

&#x200B;

**Research / Work Study / Presidential's Aid**

I had a lot of problems with this my first semester. As an incoming student, I was not in the Honors College or had work study, but I wanted to work in a lab on campus. Many people I knew who had work-study weren't even going to their ""jobs"" that were assigned to them and LSU can only give out so much per semester. If end up not using your Work-Study make sure to contact the appropriate people so that people who need the money can work.

If you want to keep the work-study but don't enjoy the lab description, change it. You are able to actually find a faculty mentor underneath each departments faculty page that is doing research on a topic that you enjoy. After you find one just shoot them an email and say that you want to work in their lab. Most labs have no undergraduates working in them so a lot of professors are kind of desperate. If you don't want to look too hard like I did then you can go onto LSU Discover's Mentor Database where faculty mentors actually post position listings that you can apply for.

I ended up volunteering in a lab my first semester and carried out my own research on 3D reconstruction of thin connective tissue structures and ended up publishing an abstract in it for my second semester. It is so easy to excel in most labs if you put some amount of effort into them and treat them like a class (but you get paid for it). While I was volunteering I still kept all of my time sheets and when I received Work-Study I was able to get the 800 dollars worth of hours I had put into my work at the end of the semester. So even if you don't have Work Study you can volunteer in a lab and keep track of your time to be paid when you do receive it.

Continuing with my published abstract, my professor asked me if I wanted to present my research at a conference in Orlando, Florida. Of course, I said yes but I didn't have the money for it. LSU paid for my entire travel expense. They gave me 1000 to go to a science conference in Orlando, Florida to present my research through the Undergraduate Research Travel Stipend and it was an amazing experience highly recommend it. Looks great on resumes if you plan on applying to further education.

How bad are the Edward Gay Apartments?,2,34,"So I applied to LSU last minute (I didn't think I would get in, it took forever to convince myself to apply). I am now admitted and paid the enrollment fee, however, this means now I am late with applying for the apartments. Originally, I was just going to stay with my cousin, but now I figured out that she has 6 people already living there and adding a 7th we would struggle with food (they eat everything!). So now I am trying to get on the wait list for the East Campus Apartments and the West Campus Apartments. I spoke to the people in housing and they say the on campus apartments are 60% full and to name my top 3 choices, I listed the WCA, ECA (both are furnished), and the Edward Gay Apartments (unfurnished), and as a last resort I'd be willing to live in the dorms (not looking at them because beggars can't be choosy). They told me my best bet would be the Ed gay apartments because the application for that apartment opens on June 3rd. But I just read an article that says the Ed gay apartments need to be tore down because it's old, you have to keep your air condition on 70  because if you lower it in the summer mold will grow on the walls. I also heard that the apartments have small roaches (which are hard to get rid of). IDK what to do, if I stay with my cousin, I might have to fight for food and have no privacy. I can't afford off campus apartments because I have no Job but I have money, but they said I would need a co-sign ( which i have no one to co sign), I am not from baton rouge so I can scratch out a roommate (unless it's a random from the internet).  Are the Ed Gay Apartments that bad? Also, should I stay on the wait list and still fill out the Ed Gay Apartments as a last resort?

What should I do???,3,30,"Hey, I’m a upcoming senior in high school and like everyone, I’m stressing about colleges and majors right now. I technically have 2 options:

1) Go to LSU and major in biochemistry (which is my dream)
2) Go to ULL and major in chemical engineering 

 I want to go to med school, biochemistry is going to be an advance because it has all of the requirements and the most important thing is I love it so much. I’m concerning what happens if I can’t get in med school. I feels like the biochemistry degree would be harder to find a decent job right out of college and go to LSU would cost a lot more than ULL since I live in Lafayette.

If I go to ULL, I can save a bit of money and have a guarantee job if I cannot get in med school but I don’t really know if I’m going to like engineering, I never thought of it before, plus it definitely going to be harder to maintain a good GPA.

LSU Dining won't reveal door prices for its dining halls-- Please help me get their attention and show that students matter,13,8,"I'm a fellow LSU student who lives on campus but is not required to buy a meal plan, but am considering buying one for the convenience. I've been trying to figure out the door price (price without a meal plan) at the dining halls this week, but LSU Dining simply will not tell me. Instead, they've **deleted** my two posts on their Facebook wall asking about the door price.

My guess is this is because LSU Dining doesn't want students to figure out that often times the door price at The 459 or The 5 is cheaper than if you had bought a meal plan. For instance, the cost can be as high as $11 per meal with certain plans, but I've heard that the door price is only $8 or $9. Their website states that you must go the dining hall and ask in person to find out the door price-- nothing is published online.

I don't care that LSU Dining is for-profit so much as I'm pissed that they've been deleting my perfectly legitimate questions asking about pay-as-you-go meal pricing. LSU Dining apparently doesn't think it has to answer student questions via social media. They treat students like children to be walked over.  

[Here's a link](http://www.facebook.com/LSUDining) to LSU Dining's Facebook page. Care to help me bring this to their attention? All I'm requesting is that you kindly ask how much the door price is at the dining halls.

I know the current direct admit for fall applications was a 3.8 and 1380, and am aware many students have gotten in with lower stats/compensation for either sat or gpa. I also saw on their website that the requirements can be subject to change when 2020 apps open. 

I have two questions: 1. How likely do you think my petition will be accepted w my stats?

Keeping Pets in the Dorm,11,8,"I am an incoming freshman and currently have a small pet lizard and was wondering if that would be allowed in the dorm room.

Older student in need of quiet housing options.,8,8,"So, I just transferred over to the Bloomington campus and I unfortunately have to dorm with freshman currently durring summer courses. I am 22 years old, I've already graduated with an associate's degree from Ivy Tech, but then I transferred from Ivy Tech to IUPUC, and then to IUB. I can't stand the obnoxious freshman, and the dorms are very disgusting making my anxiety peak to all time highs. Unfortunately being a transfer also means that I have no idea how housing necessarily functions on campus. I need something similar to an apartment provided by the school, or any recommendations for apartments that are affordable near the school. I have no idea who to talk to to ensure that I have a place to live for the fall, and I'm also not sure how to guarantee a parking permit, for I rely on my vehicle daily. Any and all advice would be incredibly helpful, and if you read this far thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this and for potentially helping me out!

Edit: I forgot to add that I need to live someplace accessable for my partner, we can't afford to get married at the moment, but we have been living together for years.

Chance of getting a solo-dorm?,3,4,"I am a returning Sophomore who transferred in to the Spring semester last school year.

Would calling/emailing RPS make any sort of difference at all if I explained my situation? Is it at all likely that I'll be able to still get a solo dorm? Would it be possible to call/email them and be put on a wait-list if somebody cancels their solo contract?

Help Choosing a Dorm,2,12,"Hi, I'm an incoming Freshman to IU in the Fall of 2016 and need some help picking out a dorm to request.

I already have my roommate picked out and we can't decide on a dorm to request. Neither of us want to live in an LLC.

We considered requesting a Northwest Enhanced dorm (Briscoe) but the distance factor from most everything seems like it is a disadvantage. But Northwest does seem to be the neighborhood where the most things happen. Briscoe seems really nice as a dorm.

We also thought about requesting central standard (Teter or Eigenmann) as the central location is great. But both buildings seem mediocre, just your traditional dorm room, not much else.

Southwest enhanced is what we decided on for now as the dorms in Willkie seem like the best of them all. Spruce seems nice too, but not as nice as Willkie. The two room suite style dorms sound like the best living situation, private bathrooms and living rooms sound great and the privacy that comes with separate bedrooms is too. But I've heard that Willkie is a quiet upperclassmen dorm, so is it a good choice for a Freshman? Also have heard Southwest is not a fun neighborhood in general.

Any help or recommendations would be great.",4gg1fy,IndianaUniversity

I'm a freshman at another pub school in Indiana, and next year I'll be transferring to IU studying Computer Science. Originally, I was planning on getting a house with some friends who are already attending IU, but those plans fell through and I'm out a house.

AFAIK, there are no requirements that first year *transfer students* have to stay on campus, so I have a lot of options in front of me. One of my other friends inquired about getting an apartment at The Dillon, but a 2 bedroom is pretty expensive and I would like to save money if I can.

Place to live off Campus with respect to getting to the Kelley School of Business,7,7,"Hi friends,

My endgoal is to find an apartment that is best suited for a grad student going to the Kelley School of Business. I have looked at availability to the west of the School along 10th Street, but wanted your input before I focused my search. Perhaps there is high crime in that area, or perhaps parking is a nightmare and you wished you lived somewhere else despite the proximity to the Kelley School of Business. What it boils down to is I am trying to find the best location.

My criterion, in order of importance are:

1.	Proximity / Most Direct / or best way to get to the Kelley School of Business.
2.	Being able to bike and walk to the School.
3.	Safe neighborhood.

A little background:
-Talking with dorm managers about my situation, looks like living off campus is the best option.
-Looked at GPSG and some other sites, but wanted input on this post to narrow a location down.
-Really do not want to drive.

Thank you for your time. I feel like I have exhausted all of my immediate resources and still feel like I need more information. If I could enlist your experience, I would sincerely appreciate it.

THE FALL 2019 RUSH GUIDE,82,17,"Well well well. . . look what you have stumbled upon. 

It’s /u/uscrushburnerrsdn with the content all of you naive soon to be rushees have been waiting for. I’ve seen your PM’s to me, I’ve heard your chatter all over /r/USC, and I’m finally delivering, just in time. Yep, it’s my OFFICIAL FALL 2019 FRATERNITY RUSH GUIDE. This will answer all, if not most questions you may have about how to go through fraternity rush at USC this fall. 

Now, after my introduction, let me preface my post by saying this. What makes me qualified to talk about all of this? I have a relevant position at one of the fraternities that I’m going to list later on. No, I’m not telling you which one. I know what doxxing is and I’m not an idiot. I have friends in nearly every single house on the row and I know how rush works after seeing the process from both sides. Why are *you* the one making this post? I’m doing it because I want to teach the people of /r/USC, okay? Rush sucks and if I make things easier for you, you will sure make things easier for me. Win-win situations, everyone goes home happy. Now sit back and appreciate this novel of a post. 

#RUSH. HOW IT WORKS, AND HOW TO DO IT.

Heads up: Freshmen can’t rush for the fall semester. Looks like you’re stuck with Bandito’s and dorm parties for a semester. 

I’m not here to convince you why you should rush, but I will say that going Greek has by far been the best thing for my social and personal life so far at USC. Even if you are not really high on the idea of being in Greek life, you can rush and still not have to commit to being in a house. If you haven’t already, sign up for rush online at www.uscifc.com because it’s not that hard. You won’t be able to rush in the first place unless you have that done. Already registered? Good, next step. 

**Before Rush**

If you know someone in one of the fraternities **well**, then you can go ahead and text them. Give them a heads up. Something subtle. Like, “Hey, just wanted to let you know that I’m rushing and hope to see you at house tours.”. Nothing more. They’ll appreciate it, and they might go ahead and tell some other guys in the house to be on the look out for you. It shows them that you’re interested and it can’t hurt you. 

Remember, nothing more than that. I promise. 

**During Rush**

***Friday, 8/23 - Rush Kickoff:*** It’s a meeting at Bovard followed by a “barbecue”. The meeting at Bovard is a joke. You sit in the auditorium seats and each house introduces themselves with a PowerPoint slide that shows their famous alumni, their events, and maybe one other minute detail about their house. If I remember correctly, they split you into your rush groups here, where you will be for house tours, but they’re not relevant on the kickoff night. The barbecue is merely the rush chairs and a few of the younger bros hanging around a table and some folding chairs in the McCarthy Quad. This is the first time you can make an impression but with a bad ratio between rushees and brothers you need to move around fast and recognize if you’re not getting enough face time with guys at a house. Meet as many guys at as many different houses as you can, because the guys there will have more clout in voting situations. Best case scenario some of them will already recognize you by the time you walk through for house tours. I wouldn’t say that the barbecue is really important but if you can meet some people there who will take you under their wing through house tours and maybe the rest of rush, that’s great. 

***Saturday, 8/24 - House Tours Day 1:*** Alright, this is where rush gets serious. This is the actual “rush” part of the process. The groups that you got split into at the rush kickoff come into play now. You’ll be told where to meet up with your groups and you have to be with them all day long. You will only go to half of the fraternity houses on day 1. It’s a very long process and it sucks for both rushees and all of the current brothers but it’s a better system than how rush used to be. 

If they’re doing it the same as last year, you’ll have exactly 30 minutes at each house. IFC is really strict with it so you have to be smart with your time. Each house will shuffle you in and split you off immediately to go and do an official house tour. It’s just to show you around. You’ll see a few bedrooms, the gym, the party space, and maybe the chapter room or some other random spots that said house takes pride in. That should take no more than 5-10 minutes. After the house tour though, it’s on. All of the brothers will be in one area and you have to go and talk to as many of them as you can while still making an impression. 95% of the time, you have to personally walk up to them and introduce yourself, while they will engage you in the conversation and keep the questions flowing. Once you feel like you’ve had a good intro conversation with someone and then talked about one random, memorable thing (that still ties into the conversation), just tell them that you have to keep moving around, they’ll understand, and you have to move to the next person. 

Understand this part though. With the new (as of last semester) rush system, every single rushee has to go to every single house, regardless of wether they want to or not. If the house you’re going through has common sense, they will split up rushees immediately into who they like and who they do not like. You have to be self aware enough to understand that you might end up at a house where they’re just not interested in you and you’ve got to accept that. Pick up their signals and it you will both be better off. If they like you: odds are you’ll get shuffled through and you will meet a lot of important brothers or just large numbers of them. All of the rush chairs, maybe the President, some other bros will be told to meet you as opposed to you walking up to them. If they don’t like you: odds are you will be moved to corners of the areas where everyone is talking to get set up with some people who will eat away your time, or brothers just will not have any desire to talk to you. They might even walk away when another brother tells them to go and meet someone else. This is just the harsh reality of rush and the faster you accept it, the better, because then you won’t waste your time there on your 3rd day of house tours. You’ll know if they are interested or if they are not interested if you can pick up on simple context clues. 

These house tours days are really long and grueling. You will be tired, and so will the brothers. They will talk to a ton of rushees. Do what you can to stand out and your name and face will probably be well received when the chapter does voting later that night. Also, be yourself. If you try to play a part or pretend you’re someone that you truly are not, everyone will see right through you. It’s so obvious. 

***Sunday, 8/25 - House Tours Day 2:*** It’s exactly the same routine as House Tours Day 1 but this time, you go with your same groups and tour the other half of the houses on the row. 

***Monday, 8/26 - House Tours Day 3:*** House tours on the 3rd day are slightly different because you get to break off from your groups and go to houses on your own. I want to say houses can make cuts before day 3 of house tours so there may be some houses that you aren’t allowed to go back to. To be honest I don’t totally remember how we did it last semester but we may have made cuts before the open house tours day. Obviously, if you’re cut from a house and they don’t show up on your online rush portal, then you’re not allowed back. It’s pretty self explanatory but my only advice here is to go back to the houses where you think you have a shot, and split up your time between 2+ houses. Try to talk to people who you haven’t talked to and maybe say hi to other guys who you had good conversations with. Not that hard. 

***Tuesday 8/27 and Wednesday 8/28 - Off Campus Events Days 1 and 2:*** These are like house tours all over again, but they’re more extended, limited to one house per night, and they’re at a venue. Most houses will have you take a bus to a site in the LA area. Typically, they have dinner catered and venues will be something like “bowling alley”, “mansion night”, “batting cages”, or “cigar night”. Same thing as house tours, just try to meet as many guys as you can. It will sound cliche by the end of rush but it’s really the best advice you can follow. Try to split up your off campus events between 2 houses if you can, but you can very easily take your chances by pushing all in on one house. Or “suiciding” as they call it. It’s called that for a reason because it’s significantly more risky but you can still get a bid if you’re really confident in said house. The only reason why I say split it up is because the luxury of going into Blue Chip Dinner with 2 or more invites is a good spot to be in. A majority of the houses (I know of at least one that doesn’t) will be making cuts after either one or both nights of the off campus events. 

***Thursday, 8/29 - Blue Chip Dinner:*** Also known as just “Blue Chip” to most, it’s more selective than the prior events. You can only pick one house’s Blue Chip invite. It’s a formal dinner somewhere in LA where you dress up in a suit and go to dinner with the a ton of the brothers and the rushees. Each house has their own deal with Blue Chip, and usually you will see tons of brothers who you have never seen before. Some houses might mess with you and ask really weird questions to see how you will react to it, and others might be really chill and have it be more like house tours or the off campus events where they just want to talk to you on a personal level. A lot goes on at Blue Chip but my only tip for you is: don’t be an idiot, and you’ll see yourself getting a bid. 

***Friday, 8/30 - Bid Night:*** Every house does it differently. Have fun with it. If you got a bid, congrats, if you didn’t, it’s not the end of the road for you. 

**After Rush**

If you didn’t get a bid during rush, there is secondary rush, which is much more laid back. It’s just a few hours, every house is required to have representatives there, and you can just go to talk to the rush chairs or whoever else is there. If a house likes you, they might offer you a bid on the spot or text you later on letting you know. If you come out of secondary empty handed, then either rush next semester or come to the conclusion that maybe Greek Life isn’t for you.

Obviously there is a lot more to rush behind the scenes, PM me if you’re interested in hearing about it. 

#THE FRATERNITIES

Let’s be honest. This is what you’re probably here for. I’m not going to provide “rankings”, because all those do is provide toxicity to Greek Life at USC. All of you naïve freshmen and transfer students who keep refreshing GreekRank every 15 minutes are just looking at junk from GDIs, other rushees, and some houses that think they can self rank their way to relevance. So, with that being said, *I am listing the IFC fraternities only and I am putting them in Greek alphabetical order.* Get over it nerds, I’m not ranking. I’m just going to tell you what I know about each house and my personal opinions on them.

There are positive things and negative things to say about every house on the row, but all in all, you just have to choose which is right for you. This is just to give you a rundown of what they're like from an unbiased view. 

**ΑΕΠ - Alpha Epsilon Pi -** ***“AEPi”***: I’m 90% sure AEPi is taking over the old Pi Kapp house (742 W 28th St.), which in my opinion is better than their old house that Sammy took over. AEPi’s new house has a decent party space in the backyard and it is set up pretty well on the inside. AEPi was pretty quiet last fall because they got into some trouble (and nearly got kicked off after a long suspension) for “an incident”, if that tells you anything. They’re nationally Jewish and word on the street is that they are looking to take more Jewish kids this semester because nationals wants them to meet a quota. Even though their house is supposed to be Jewish they are maybe 20% Jewish right now. They have above average sorority relations and threw some decent parties come the Spring semester. Hard pledge semester. 

**ΔΤΔ - Delta Tau Delta -** ***“Delt”, “DTD”***: Delt is on the smaller side in terms of membership, but will remind you that their chapter has perhaps one of the most famous fraternity alumni of all time. [Will Ferrell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow_B5Ic8erQ). Their house (833 W 28th St.) and party space is huge but it is owned by a fraternity that is eligible to re-establish their charter and they could be told to leave soon. It feels like a true “Frat House” on the inside too. They haven’t really taken advantage of the resources they have and I can’t say I know much about their pledge semester. They’re not the most social of houses but they’re good guys. That’s all I really can say because I don’t know much about them. 

**ZBT - Zeta Beta Tau -** ***“ZBT”***: ZBT is the 3rd Jewish fraternity, and along with Sammy, it’s more Jewish heavy than AEPi is even though ironically, they're not nationally affiliated with a religion. ZBT is pretty New York and East Coast heavy, but they have a good mix of everyone considering they are one of the biggest fraternities at USC. They easily have 200+ active members. ZBT is in an old sorority house that’s honestly not as impressive as it looks from the outside. They have a good party space out back that is covered up and a pretty good front yard. They had a space themed party like every other house on the row but I couldn’t tell you how well received they were. They have okay sorority relations and a harder than average pledge semester.

**ΚΣ - Kappa Sigma -** ***“Kappa Sig”***: Kappa Sig looks pretty meh from the outside (928 W 28th St.) but they got a ton of alumni money to redo their house and it’s arguably one of the nicer ones on the row now on the inside. They have a big side yard like Sig Nu and a basketball court out back so it's a pretty good sized party space but supposedly they’ve been on suspension from their nationals now for a while because it’s been like at least a year since they have had a party. If they're off of their national suspension now they should have the budget saved for a decent social semester. Their sorority relations are alright but I guess that’s the side effect of not having parties for a while. Kappa Sig is another one of those houses that doesn’t totally have a lot of guys from one specific area, it’s more of a mix. They have an easy pledge semester. 

**ΛΧΑ - Lambda Chi Alpha -** ***“Lambda”, “Lambda Chi”***: Lambda keeps up good sorority relations despite how bad their house and their party space is (720 W 28th St.) because they throw good parties and they have big names in their house. They always are playing basketball out front of their house. I know that they just bought their house which means it’s harder for them to get kicked off. They tend to bid a lot of big money kids and athletes. A lot of people tend to say that Lambda is Bay Area or international heavy. Lambda has a notoriously easy pledge semester and it is general knowledge that their house doesn’t have great brotherhood. 

**ΠΚΑ - Pi Kappa Alpha -** ***“Pike”***: Pike nationally does not have the greatest reputation. USC Pike has historically been the same way but things seem to be changing slowly. They have one of the better houses on the row (642 W 28th St.), but they don’t own it and they will have to move 2 years from now because they only have a 3 year lease on the house. It's got a cool upstairs room with a balcony and their courtyard party space isn't huge but they make it work. As dumb as it sounds, Pike has a ton of guys who are into lifting and EDM but that’s not their only crowd. Their sorority relations are steadily improving, especially after having good parties last semester. As for their pledge semester, it’s relatively hard. 

**ΣΑΜ - Sigma Alpha Mu -** ***“Sammy”***: Sammy is formerly a Jewish fraternity nationally but they technically aren’t anymore. Even though they officially dropped their Jewish affiliation a long time ago, they are kind of known as the more Jewish house along with ZBT. Sammy takes guys that aren’t Jewish, but they still have a large amount of guys who are. They’re pretty nice and their Astroworld party put them on the map but I don’t know how well they will fare with the new house. They just took over the old AEPi house at 904 W 28th St. which I personally think is one of the worse houses on the row. Sammy has also gotten into some hot water recently for some stupid decisions and they were put on suspension last year. They have an average pledge semester. 

**ΣN - Sigma Nu -** ***“Sig Nu”***: Sigma Nu is located at 660 W 28th St. and they have a pretty good house. It looks a bit like an industrial building but they have a sand volleyball court and good party space, plus a roof that can have smaller events. Sigma Nu doesn’t really have one set stereotype like a lot of other houses do. They have guys from everywhere across the nation and they have a really diverse group. Sigma Nu is one of those houses where anyone can find people who they will get along with. In the last few years they have consistently had good parties and have made a name for themselves that way. They have decent sorority relations and a harder than average pledge semester. 

**ΣX - Sigma Chi -** ***“Sigma Chi”***: Sigma Chi is at 907 W 28th St. which is one of the biggest single houses on the row, albeit a bit of a dump. They have a big backyard and party space. They are known as a big house in terms of membership and a majority of their brothers are from Southern California. They have a big Orange County and LA surfer type crowd and they have some athletes but not as many as Lambda Chi. Their “brotherhood” is weak as they have a ton of guys in the house. They have good sorority relations and a pretty easy pledge semester. 

**TKE - Tau Kappa Epsilon -** ***“Teke”***: It’s pronounced “Teke” but I’m writing TKE because who actually writes “Teke”? Anyways, they have 2 houses (625 and 631 W 28th St.) because a big tech guy was an alum from their chapter and he donated a ton of money to the chapter, effectively giving them so much money that they could take over the house next door to them and renovate both of them. Anyone on the row will tell you that TKE has the nicest fraternity house on the row by far. Not to mention they have a massive party space with 2 backyards. One of the downfalls though is that they have well over 200 members, which can hurt brotherhood and force cliques. TKE is very LA-area heavy and they have more African-Americans than any other IFC fraternity. Their sorority relations seem to have tailed off a bit and their parties recently have not been as notable as some of their others. TKE used to be known for a very hard pledge semester but supposedly it’s not what it used to be.

**ΦΔΘ - Phi Delta Theta -** ***“Phi Delt”***: Phi Delt has a huge house (1005 W 28th St.), both physically and in terms of membership. Their backyard is massive and it makes for a good party space. One of their best parties last semester was in the rain but it still had better attendance than plenty of other ones on the row. Being as big as they are, Phi Delt is pretty diverse and has guys from everywhere. They’re also known as the most gay-friendly house on the row but that obviously doesn’t encompass all of them. They don’t have bad sorority relations, but they aren’t as good as they could be. Their pledge semester is about average, maybe slightly harder than average. 

**ΦΚΤ - Phi Kappa Tau -** ***“Phi Tau”***: Phi Tau, like Chi Phi, is very new on campus. They just started last year and I can’t imagine their membership is over 20-30 guys right now. Nothing against them, it’s just that they are too new to really know a ton about them. Don’t quote me on it, but if you take a bid from them I think you can get “Founding Father” status and you can help the chapter grow. They were planning on taking over the old Pike house (700 W 28th St.) but I don’t know if that’s going to be a sure thing going into this year. I can’t imagine they have much of a pledge semester at this point as they’re probably just looking to grow. 

**ΦΣK - Phi Sigma Kappa -** ***“Phi Sig”***: Phi Sig has a pretty impressive house and party space and house on the corner of the row at 938 W 28th St. Admittedly, I don’t know much about the crowd at Phi Sig because I have never really gotten along with any of them all that well. They aren’t as social outside of their own house as most of the other fraternities. Along with Sammy, AEPi, and Pi Kapp (no longer active), they got put on suspension last year and have been working on thin ice since. They had a huge register last semester and that helped their publicity immensely. I‘d say that their pledge semester is average. 

**ΧΦ - Chi Phi -** ***“Chi Phi”***: Chi Phi is relatively new on campus, but they just absorbed the fraternity formerly known as Beta Theta Pi because of some house politic between Beta and their nationals. They are moving into the old Sammy house (707 W 28th St) which I think is a great house with a great party space, and not to mention the roof hangout space that Sammy used. The only downfall with that place was that Sammy couldn’t change anything aesthetically with the house because a fraternity that hasn’t existed at USC for years still owns it. Chi Phi didn’t really have any sorority relations or clout on the row and they only had maybe 30 members, so it’s more like Beta is taking over everything and hiding themselves under the name “Chi Phi”. Beta had parties that were average at best and okay sorority relations. That could all change though because now they’re on the row which was easily the biggest downfall with their last house. Beta was known for having a harder than average pledge semester.

I made this specifically for housing, but if you want to ask other questions, I'm more than happy to respond to them.

Here's a quick 1 sentence ranking I did for each housing place. This is just my opinion and it can vary from person to person.
_____________________________________________________________________________
**Birnkrant** - best dorm, but need scholarship

**Pardee** - Birnkrant lite

**Marks Tower** - Pardee lite

**New/North** - Party Dorm, but super social (avoid if you're not interested in Greek Life imo)

**Marks Hall** - pretty old, but it's ok. i'd choose any of the others above ^ before this one though (except New/North personally)

**Trojan Hall** - worse than Marks Hall. i'd avoid entirely

**Parkside** (suite) - lots of engineers, introverts, quiet, nice rooms/AC. Less social than dorms, but you will get close to your 7 other suitemates (hopefully).

**Fluor Tower** (suite) - close to cinema school, lots of atheletes, probably one of the best places to live in terms of rooms/accommodations/common area/amenities (not as nice as Webb Tower though). Less social than dorms, but you will get close to your 7 other suitemates (hopefully).

**Webb Tower** (Apartment) - close to cinema school, probably THE best place to live in terms of rooms/accommodations/common area/amenities. Less social than Fluor Tower because it's apartment style, but you will get close to your 5 other apartment mates (hopefully).

Where should I live as a spring admit? (Incoming freshman),1,7,"Hey fellow experienced Trojans. I’m an incoming spring freshman admit, and housing application opens on July 1st. I’ve pretty much slacked off on housing for quite some time now and need to get serious in my researching. It would be nice if you guys can help a new Trojan out on where to live! 

My preferences:
1. I’m a light sleeper (terrible for me already because I hear college dorms can be loud, but I’ll have to manage) 
2. I like a dorm that has more of a quiet environment with people respecting others who just wants to study and sleep well for class/tests. 
3. I am NOT a party person at all and have 0 interest in Greek life. I’m coming to USC to better my education and career, and that is my #1 priority. 
4. Nice amenities 
5. I would like to socialize and make friends but not to an extreme level. I’m an introvert who’s trying to get out of her comfort zone, so a moderate amount of socializing will be good.  
6. I don’t really mind distance because I visited campus, and all the freshmen dorms seem pretty close together already. 
7. I plan to live in a double. 
8. I’m majoring in human bio (pre-health) if that helps in any way haha. 

So far I’ve crossed out Birnkrant because i didn’t get any scholarship, and I’ve crossed out New/North because I’m not a party person. I also don’t really like suites or apartments because I don’t think I can handle living with that many people yet. So between Marks Hall, Trojan Hall, and Pardee, which one should I choose?

Some Housing Tips/Recs from a Freshman!,42,10,"Hi all! To all the new freshman admits, congrats and welcome! USC is THE place to be. I'm finishing up my 2nd semester here at USC and thought it'd be nice to give a little bit of breakdown of the different housing options that you have for your first semester in college. I remember being so confused about different dorm names and wanting to know more about the different cultures of each dorm. 

Here are my personal top three dorm recommendations:

**Birnkrant** - If you're looking for a social dorm experience, BK is where it's at. Not only is it socially-active, it's also generally cleaner than other social dorms like New North. BK is also located in the center of campus, so going to class won't be a trek. The campus Starbucks is right under, and Leavey library is literally steps away from the entrance. Birnkrant is a good middle ground between Mccarthy and New North.


**Parkside A&H** - I'm honestly so happy I chose to live in 'Parkside Darkside'. Even though it has a rep for being socially dead and quiet (to a certain extent, true), if you're the type of person who wants to come home to a quiet and clean building after class, Parkside is the way to go. The suites are SUPER nice and spacious, we have cleaners who clean your private bathrooms, and the best campus dining hall is right here too! One of the main things that turns people off about PRB is the distance from classes. PRB is great if you're in Viterbi or Roski, but for someone who has all of their classes in Marshall (me), walking 15 minutes everyday can be a bother.


**Pardee** - Pardee tower is another solid choice. It's also located conveniently near most classes and in the middle of campus. Pardee is pretty social, you'll be able to find cool people on your floor for sure. There's also a business community floor in Pardee, which is something cool to look into if you're in Marshall. Pardee has spacious study rooms, but the rooms are pretty much the same size / vibe as the other residential buildings.


TIPS / REMINDERS:

McCarthy is only for Presidential and above scholarship students. If you put mccarthy as your housing options and you're not a scholarship recipient, you will be reassigned to a random building. One of my suitemates made this mistake, so don't put it down as your first three preferences!


Find a compatible roommate. You don't want to be stuck living with a randomly assigned roommate you don't end liking. Go join the USC 2023 facebook group, post a profile, and find someone you vibe with. Use online resources / apps like RentHoop - it's like a Tinder for roommates - to be more upfront about your 'dealbreakers' in housemates. 


GET DINING DOLLARS. the dining hall food will get old FAST! Dining dollars will save your hungry self when you're not in the mood for more overcooked EVK chicken. There are so many other food options on campus - Lemonade, Panda Express, Habit Burger - and dining dollars will most definitely help you out later in the year.


Again, congrats on your acceptances and good luck!",bmqby8,USC
best housing for freshman?,5,10,"I would really appreciate if someone could give some advice and maybe suggest the best fit for me. Here are my housing preferences:

* Planning on majoring in film/business so it would be nice to be close to SCA/Marshall, but I don't mind a long walk.
* Social and friendly but not too intense/loud
* Not really sure if I prefer living in a residence hall, suite, or single. 
* I don't mind communal bathrooms, as long as they're pretty new and well maintained
* AC!
* Near a library and a cafe
* Good dining options nearby
* I'm probably not going to pick New North.

Odd Question Re: McCarthy College,5,12,"So I'm a freshman applicant hoping to end up in McCarthy next year, as I'm a National Merit Finalist and will be designating USC as my first choice school. However, I'm in a wheelchair with multiple food allergies, which complicates my living situation a little bit, but I'd still really like to have as close to a normal freshman experience as as possible, and the information I've received from USC Housing so far has made me a little nervous about whether or not it will be possible to have both that and the accommodations I need. As a result I have a few questions for current students that are going to seem really oddly specific but would be really helpful to get answered if at all possible.

1. I've been told by USC Housing that there is just one suite in McCarthy that's designated as wheelchair accessible. I'm wondering if anyone who lives there (or has been there) knows what room this is and what it's like? The main things I'm looking to find out are a) is it literally just disabled students and b) am I going to get the same dorm experience as everyone else? I obviously don't have any problem having other disabled roommates, BUT I think I should be able to choose roommates who I have something in common with that's more than just being in a wheelchair, and I just feel a little uncomfortable being forced into this just b/c I'm in a wheelchair.                             **TLDR; Am I going to get a normal dorm experience in a wheelchair accessible suite or am I going to feel separated from everybody else b/c of my disability?** 
2. I'm also wondering if anyone could give me information on what the non-accessible suites are like so I can try to figure out if it would be at all possible for me to just be in one of those rather than the designated accessible suite. I can stand some so I don't need a roll-in shower, I basically just need to make sure the room is big enough that I can move around in it while in my wheelchair and that the door frames (both into the entire suite and into individual bedrooms and bathrooms within the suite) are wide enough that I can fit through them while in my wheelchair. I know it's super weird to ask but if anyone can give me info. about what the non-accessible spaces are like (or even better, how they compare to the accessible space) that would be great.                                                     **TLDR; What is the space in non-accessible suites like and can anyone give me a sense of if they will be at all navigable in a wheelchair?**
3. On the USC Housing website I saw a floor plan for a 2 person suite w/ 2 single rooms and 2 bathrooms. From an allergy perspective, this would definitely work best for me so that I'm reducing the number of people I need to convince not to eat food that will kill me and so I'm not sharing a bathroom counter or something w/ someone who rubs almond oil all over their body everyday.

Spring Admit Questions,1,1,"Hi, I have a few questions being a spring admit for spring 2020.

I'm interested in joining marching band. Is it possible for me to join when I enroll, or do I need to wait until the next fall? Also, what is their opinion on changing instruments? I'm a clarinet guy right now, but I'm kinda interested in learning percussion.

I'm a nmf, so I got the presidential scholarship. Is it possible for me to apply for a McCarthy dorm? 

The people at spring explore mentioned an involvement fair in the spring. Is that as large as the one in the fall? 

Research on campus. Is it harder to try to find research opportunities as a spring admit because most of the available research assistant opportunities are already taken, or does that not really matter?

How difficult is it to get majors/minors in different schools? E.g. I'm a biochem in Dornsife. Would it be difficult for me to get something like a CS minor from Viterbi?

Can Anyone Give Advice On How To Physically & Mentally Survive MIT?,38,13,"My girlfriend has been attending this year & I'm seriously concerned for her physical & mental health.

She already thinks her grades are slipping. She barely sleeps, often pulling more all-nighters than I think a human body can tolerate. 

She barely eats cuz she claims that she can't go on grocery runs, she was around 150lbs at the start of this semester and now has dropped 136, and estimates she's gonna drop to 123 before her body stabilizes, if it stabilizes at all, I worry that she's gonna keep losing weight since she's not eating. All her food comes from free food at events and meetings, or by ordering out twice a week & trying to make the food last as long as possible, though she says she doesn't feel hungry anymore.

She also been suffering from chronic depression before the semester started, she said she was going to see the campus therapist but now doesn't have time for it anymore. I don't know if the constant stress is going to make it worse or actually distracts her from it, but I still worry about her mental health.

Last time I visited her she was so drained and zombie like, I didn't see her back to her bubbly self until I convinced her to pop in a movie and relax, and afterwards she was slightly better. She used to be so bubbly, energetic & affectionate all the time, and now she's so drained that she didn't wanna leave her dorm the entire time I was there. 

I wanna help her, but I've never been to a school this demanding and intensive, so I don't know what would help, I have no idea if it's a matter of being more efficient with time or something else completely. I'm not even sure if this is typical for most students working in IT & programming. If this is the typical lifestyle then I guess that would make me less worried, but still there's gotta be a way to make it less bearable.

Some Questions for some MIT Graduate Students,7,15,"Hey guys! I was accepted to a Ph.D. program at MIT with the Chemistry department, but I deferred my enrollment to start Fall 2019. As excited as I am to move from IL to MA, I wanted to be prepared for the transition as well as get some of my questions answered about what to expect when I get there while also help me in my move planning.

1. I've read that bringing my car is essentially useless in the Cambridge/Boston area unless I want an excuse to not drink, but I have a motorcycle I will be bringing with me as I will not have any way to store it and have someone reliable take care of it (i.e. ride it and run it occasionally) during my extended time away from home (plus, I don't want to part with it). Is it possible to pay for a parking permit and have it with me near my dorm in a covered lot/garage for several months? If not, is there any storage facilities nearby campus I can keep it at that you know of? 
2. As an incoming graduate student, how easy was applying and getting graduate housing? I recall reading on the webpage that you need to be fully registered, but, as a new grad student, will registration take place before the application closes for housing? Or is there an exception? Or will I be ultimately stuck rushing to get paperwork in next August when I arrive with my belongings to find housing? I am concerned because I will be funding my entire move only through money I am earning at a full-time job, and I would like gauge how much I should aim to save up.
3. I have the understanding it is nearly unheard of to live on-campus at MIT for more than a few years as a graduate student, but is it possible? Renting near campus without roommates is insane compared to my current rent in the suburbs of Chicago (which can be somewhat pricey still). For those of you who transitioned from on- to off-campus, what suggestions would you have to make it easier? Were you more involved in social events your first year and able to find roommates with friends? How did you find a place? How did you find your roommates?
4. I am looking to visit the area before the visiting weekend in March 2019 since I have never been to MA. Is there any places you would suggest I see or go to? It will likely be on a weekend, so I don't expect to see much relating to the MIT facilities.
5. What is something you like about MIT, and what is something you think could be better? Is there anything I should be mentally preparing myself for?

"Culture shift, sadness",46,10,"I’ve been at the Institute for a long time, and I’ve been fortunate in that I’ve worked in different areas of campus (which gives me a broader perspective). I had some interaction with campus in the Chuck Vest era. Today, it feels like MIT’s culture has shifted significantly since that time.

While it’s difficult to describe a “feeling,” MIT seems less quirky and tolerant. There are more layers of bureaucracy, whereas MIT felt more open and a little bit grassroots in the past.

The tenor on campus has also changed. Faculty who used to be known for their warmth and support seem jaded and anxious. MIT has always been hypercritical, but that attitude came from a relentless desire for excellence. It’s started to feel like we all engage in criticism for the sake of criticism. 

I also miss our culture of service. It used to feel like everyone at MIT was rowing together towards a great, common mission. No matter one’s role, people took pride in their work and there was less elitism — all good work was recognized. It’s been hard to find people like that now.

I at times wonder how much Presidents and administration impact a place. I’ve heard that there’s a lot of Harvard influence on campus, due to hires from Harvard into the administration. But I don’t have anything to really substantiate that.

I feel sad for the culture shift and disappointed that we’ve lost touch with the old MIT. It’s true that nothing quite stays the same at a place that prides itself on inventing the future. But I didn’t anticipate a seismic shift in our culture and values.",8phm1v,MIT
Some (poorly written) hope for low-income freshmen,59,17,"I'm an alum, graduated in '15. I was just thinking about how I felt this time freshman year. Using a temp account to post this in hopes that some other MIT student in my shoes can benefit from my experience.

For context: I went to MIT as a first generation kid with a household income of about $30k a year. I don't write this as a sob story. We had a house, cars, food, etc. Things could have been worse: high school friends dealt with single parents, domestic abuse, drug/alcohol problems, but I had none of those. Never thought of myself as poor, just thought that's how the world worked. In fact, at the time $30k was about the 30-40%ile nationally.

Coming to MIT was a culture shock to say the least. It felt like nearly everyone I met went to a stellar private school, traveled internationally, had impeccable wardrobes, the newest iPhones, etc. They talked about ski trips and concerts. I had been to one sit-down restaurants in my life and had never even seen a mountain.

There were some orientation classes on imposter syndrome, but they were of little use when you had to catch up socially as well as academically. I felt incredibly doomed and behind.

I wish someone had told me upfront: There is hardly as much income diversity at MIT as they'd like you to believe. Using the stats MIT releases today, only 26% of families have an income below $90k, which is hardly low-income itself (barring HCOL cities). 42% of the school received no financial aid at all, which probably means they were 1%ers or close. I'd guess an income of $30k is in the bottom 5% of families at MIT. 

Of the fellow students who were ""low income"", many were clustered in minority houses or particular dorms like senior house. These groups tend to be more close-knit by design. 

Point being - if you're not in those groups nearly every single person you meet will have grown up much, much more wealthy, full stop. There is nothing wrong with what you know and have done, you just had different opportunities. Don't worry about fixing yourself, you're fine. Keep working and you'll end up surprising yourself.

"Thoughts on Pilot 2021, The Institute, et al.",31,25,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think we can agree Pilot 2021 has been a shitshow - administration pointing fingers at ""raunchy"" student behavior, students pointing fingers right back at the ""overbearing"" administration, mailing and news articles blowing up with different rhetorics and angles, all with an undertone of general butthurt. It's chaotic and tiring. I wanted to make sense of what's going on, and possibly shed some light for other students wondering the same thing. I'm speaking to the MIT students, and I hope you can fill in some of the missing details on your own. It's a long post, but you've definitely done worse. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a conflict at the center of Pilot 2021, and inherent to conflict are differing interest groups. It's pretty easy to see what those are: students and administration. There was a dynamic in the past, and that dynamic is now being challenged. Pilot 2021 is a symptom of a challenge to status quo. So who's doing the challenging?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think us students have changed much. Undergrads are undergrads. We want to have fun, we want to explore ourselves and the world around us, we want a world-class education, and to make the most of our young adulthood in general. Undergrads cycle in and out every four year (más o menos, hah). There's never too much variance in that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
More specifically, that is, in the ideology underlying the typical MIT student's mind. There is no pressing issue or cause to our generation. No Vietnam War, no Civil Rights movement, and the ""new tech/social media"" era all in all hasn't done much to change our dynamic with the relevant parties in our sphere. Senior House has always been Senior House. What has changed though, and changed pretty drastically, is the administration.

_______________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How does Senior House fit in this picture? The center of everything is Reif's fundraising push. Note that I'm speculating from this point on, but it doesn't take a genius to see why it makes sense. 
__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hockfield had MITEI, the Koch Institude, edX, and Kendall Square under her belt. Her academic background lies primarily in biology. She led the Diversity Leadership Congress, which brought more women and minority scholars to MIT faculty. She has industry ties, but is also on the Board of Trustees for the BSO. Her presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT's history, something like a delta of nearly $3 billion. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reif needs to build a similarly impressive legacy. It's not nefarious; hell it's his job. Some background, Reif is a bit of a ""harder"" character than Hockfield. Reif was an electrical engineering professor. He was Head of EECS in the mid-00's, a position that has close ties with MIT Lincoln Labs, which is a DoD research center and brings in over a quarter of MIT's revenue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reif is leveraging this angle to sell the Campaign for a Better World to industry donors. It aims an eye-watering $5 billion goal, intended to build up the Institution in the name of human progress. Rief moves Grimson, who served as the previous Head of EECS, from his role as *Chancellor*, to a newly minted *Chancellor of Academic Achievement* role. Why? Because they're both of similar career background. They better present a unified front for the campaign. 

The *Chancellor*...
>...has oversight responsibility for graduate and undergraduate education at MIT, student life, student services, and other areas that impact student experience.

While the *Chancellor of Academic Achievement*...

>...engage[s] the Institute with prospective donors—both alumni/alumnae and others unaffiliated with MIT but who share its vision—the majority of the Chancellor[of Academic Achievement]’s time has been spent meeting with such prospective donors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our current Chancellor Barnhart replaces Grimson, circa 2014, with Suzy Nelson as Dean of Student Life to assist. Her role is two-fold. Make sure the student body is aligned to the values of the initiative, as per point six of the campaign, *The MIT Core: Attracting extraordinary students and faculty, and providing them with the resources they need to thrive*, and to **make sure student life isn't an issue for the campaign.** The faces can't present a unified front if the student body doesn't present an ""extraordinary"" image to match. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That brings us to the Healthy Minds survey. Yes, the metadata was supposed to be confidential. Yes, the turnaround process was initiated with its results. I feel the survey was a tool to align the image of student body with the fundraising initiative. It was sold with the aim of improving student life, which was a misleadingly positive take on ""highlighting under-performing areas for future correction"". 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a scene in the movie Syriana that poignantly describes the administration's relationship with Senior House. In Syriana, two US oil companies are attempting a merger, but are under pressure from antitrust regulators from US DoJ. The oil companies hire a D.C. law firm with government ties to convince the DoJ of the merger's ethicality. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lawyer working on this case, Bennett Holiday, is at a barbecue with the CEO of one of the oil companies. The CEO has given one example of malpractice at his company to Holiday, but the DoJ isn't satisfied. They need a bigger fish to fry. But the CEO challenges Holiday, ""You dig a three foot hole and find three bodies, but you might dig a ten foot hole and find forty...""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Holiday is unphased. The DoJ knows the oil companies are corrupt to the bone. The DoJ also wants the merger to go through, it's good for American prosperity. ""Hell, China's economy can't grow as fast as they can because they can't get the oil they need, and I'm damn proud of that fact"". What the DoJ needs, according to Holiday, is to **give the impression of serving due diligence**, and it is implied that they are not serving due diligence itself. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chancellor Barnhart is Bennett Holiday. ""Our students are the brightest on the planet. The student body is inherently aligned to the President's goal of improving research and education. Everyone is on board. *There are no problems here.*""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The survey and turnaround were meant to give the impression of doing due diligence. When an underperforming dorm was found, the administration worked with the dorm to improve it! The real wrench in the machine though, was when someone got caught with guns, bringing an unexpectedly amount of public light to the turnaround, and putting the Senior House name to the forefront of MIT's image. That's a huge no-no. Visibility is everything to a fundraising campaign. The admins pondered what to do, did some more digging, and found some more bodies. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think the administration meant to uncover what they did, but there was no turning back once it happened. If the administration knows what students are up to, and the students know that they know, what can the administration do? They can't just turn a blind eye. That doesn't live up to the students' expectations of them, and also has great potential to **shatter the impression of due diligence.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead, slap the Pilot 2021 bandaid on it. Say that the turnaround's expectations weren't met, direct attention away from exactly went wrong, and instead make a point of emphasizing that more drastic action was taken. Pilot 2021 was an attempt to throw dirt back in the hole before the outside world saw what was in it. 
__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think that's why I felt the administration of recent came off as ""shady"". Their intentions weren't bad: there's nothing wrong at all with Campaign for a Better World's aims. Better the world by improving MIT infrastructure, and enable students and faculty to achieve their greatest potential - I don't think anyone can find fault in that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's just that the process of curating the MIT's image is not something the administration can be 100% honest about. Certainly not to students, to whom the administration must cater to, and **will hold them to a greater ethical standard than even the potential donors.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's why all the talk about ""Pilot 2021 displaces LGBTQ and minority students"", ""unethical survey standards"", or ""punishing a whole dorm for the mistakes of a few"" never made much sense to me. I think it should be obvious that MIT administration isn't ""out for"" Senior House. They're not out for anyone. What happened was that SH became a giant, unavoidable pothole to the aims of Reif's campaign. 

__________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nobody created these problems. The administration didn't intend to, and Senior House certainly didn't intend to. And once students started getting more vocal about Pilot 2021, rumors spreading online, more fingers pointed...all in all becoming more *visible* to the general public, the administration really had no other choice but to scrap the poor option for an absolute one. That was the trajectory all parties were on from the beginning, and I honestly don't believe it was planned by anyone. Nobody plans for things to go this awfully, and anyone who might probably wouldn't be sitting on the senior leadership council at MIT. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's really not much that can be done in terms of going back to the way things were. There's no rewind button on this situation. I think this situation speaks volumes for how small, ethically questionable actions (that survey bothers me more than anything else) can create larger problems in the future. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope something positive can come out of all this. SH is all but in ashes (only logistically, certainly not in spirit), but I don't think it means this has to be a total loss. I read talk about creating an alternative living space off-campus...seeing something like that succeed would really be a testament to the vibrancy and individuality of our student body. It'd certainly be a better way to showcasing MIT than this previous attempt. ",6m1ovh,MIT

Why the MIT administration is uncommunicative about Senior House,14,7,"Throughout the Senior House saga, the administration appears to have been minimizing the scope of its public statements and its participation in discussion. They've left most of the public arguments on the issue unaddressed, in a way that appears unresponsive to student and public concerns and unfair to Senior House residents.

Of particular note is the claim that Senior House has a lower graduation rate because of its demographics, particularly including racial and income demographics, and that disbanding Senior House is discriminatory. But here's the thing. As soon as that accusation was made publicly, the MIT administration could no longer speak freely; all statements from that point forward were filtered through lawyers, lawyers who carefully consider whether each statement would hurt MIT in a lawsuit. So an in-depth discussion of the graduation rate and drug use survey statistics is out. A dialogue with protesters is out, because speaking under uncontrolled circumstances would risk Cynthia Barnhart ending up like Lawrence Summers.

This was a mistake, since the non-communicative strategy burnt bridges and built ill will, but that's probably what happened.

So MIT asked everyone to reapply for residence, and got a pile of readmission applications. These applications would have been only a subset of Senior House, and not a random subset; it will have a somewhat different cultural and demographic distribution than the original set of residents. They looked at this pile of applications with two questions in mind: (1) Will this set of people create the sort of culture they want? And (2) Does this set of people have racial or other demographic differences from the original Senior House population, such that if they accept only the people who applied for readmission, they can get sued for racial discrimination?

After considering those two questions, MIT decided to disband Senior House entirely. Somewhere, they have a confidential memo describing their reasons, and a confidential memo describing the demographics of the population that applied for readmission.

A single as a freshman,5,12,"How should I rank the dorms if I want a single as a freshman? I originally ranked Next #1, Simmons and McCormick #2, and MacGregor #3 just based on price and amenities and dorm culture and such (I stayed in Simmons during campus preview weekend).

I know I can still change dorms during orientation through FYRE but I'd like to at least start with a good room/dorm. 

Also, would you even recommend having a single as a freshman? People have been telling me that I may get isolated if I get a single, though I think I'll feel uncomfortable with a roommate. Thanks.

Dorming but no money,5,15,"My parents admit they can't afford to pay for me when I plan to dorm next year. The reason why I want to dorm is because I want to be more involved in campus.

I am not even close to Houston and my approximate commute each day is about 2 hours or 1.5 hours if it is a good day. I don't drive to campus and take the public transportation. I really want to be more involved in school but because I live so far, it makes it difficult for me to stay and attend club and school related events. I want to know what my options are and am willing to take a small financial sacrifice to achieve it. I don't know what to do exactly. My family is not poor but frankly we have some personal family circumstances that the FAFSA does not take account when giving me aid.

Commuting or Dorming?,15,11,"I’m in my second year at UH right now as a premed, and I’ve lived on campus so far. I really like the convenience, and feel I’ve made a lot of friends by living on campus, gotten more time to study in my harder subjects (which I’ll pretty much be done with by the end of this semester), and had a chance to get really involved with extracurriculars. So I’m really glad I did and have no regrets. But now, I’m considering getting a car and commuting instead because sometimes I get really sick of being stuck on campus, I want to spend more time with my family, not have to worry about eating unhealthy on campus or getting a ride every week or dealing with roommates. (And it’s just too expensive to have both a car and dorm.)

I live in The Woodlands, 10 minutes into the Sawdust exit, so I think my commute would be an hour usually? With Hardy or HOV maybe even less. 

I wanted to get some opinions from people who have commuted/do commute from a fairly far distance - do you guys feel like a lot of your time is wasted? Do you only come to campus 2 days a week?

After I had already taken a bite out of the burger. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Do not eat at this place not just for the shitty service, but for your health. I’ve been to McDonald’s before with really bad service, but nothing to this degree, where the food is actually a threat to your health.

Moody or Cougar Place?,1,9,"Heya, back with another question!

&#x200B;

I'm stuck deciding where to dorm for next year, Fall 2020. I managed to snag a room at Cougar Place for honors but I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in honors - but there's no normal dorms available at Cougar Place and I have no idea who I'm dorming with. On the other hand, my wonderful suitemate apparently mentioned that she'd like to ask me about rooming with her next year at Moody, which I'd be so down for, however my family is against Moody due to the conditions they've heard about.

Does anyone have any tips or advice about this?

CP:

Pros - Individual room, bathroom, kitchen all included, parents prefer more

Cons - Honors(?), unknown roommates, farther distance from things, more costly

Moody:

Pros - With someone I know, closer to area that I know, ???????? idk what else, non-honors

Cons - Family is against it, heard bad things about it

&#x200B;

Thank you!

Fast forward to move-in day, and he's actually smoking/vaping in the dorm, with and without the doors open, which makes me very uncomfortable. I haven't brought it up, because he keeps his vape and cartridges in his own personal lockbox.

Looking for feedback based on your experience,1,0,"Hi,

I built a [freelancing platform](https://thesprowt.com) for college students and would really appreciate any feedback you have. The platform is still in beta stage but we have a number of projects currently up and batches of new ones on the way.

When I was in college I felt that there were very few paid internships available and you were either stuck working a low paying job that provided little experience (ie: McDonald's/Uber) of for free somewhere more career-focused. The goal of the platform is to provide more career-focused paid opportunities to students so that you can gain both cash and experience from your dorm room.

Given that the platform was designed for you, I'm looking for feedback on how we can make it better. Any comments you have (good or bad) would be appreciated. Hope this can be helpful to you. Thanks!

I got admitted and have some questions as an out of state transfer,13,22,"So I just found out I got admitted to UH as a transfer for this upcoming Fall semester! I'll be going into my Junior year and am coming from the northeast, where I've lived pretty much all my life. I've been to Houston once for vacation, so I don't know much about life in the South/ Texas. My questions for current students and alum:

* Where should I live as a transfer junior? I prefer a single room with my own bathroom, looking for apartments but I could live in a house as well on campus/near school.
* I probably won't have a car here (at least not for the first semester), is that gonna be a huge problem for me or can I work around it?
* How's the social life at UH? I'm coming from a party school so I'd like to go out on weekends to house parties, frats, clubs, bars, etc. (I'm almost 21 but also wondering how strict they are with fake IDs here)
* How hard is it to adjust as a transfer? Any out of state students that could give me advice too?

I'd appreciate any help or answers or advice from you guys. I'm really considering going here but just gotta make sure it's the right fit. Thanks",bjayn1,UniversityOfHouston

"A few questions? (Housing, Math Placement)",6,12,"Heya! 

So I have a couple of questions as I'm an upcoming UH engineering student this Fall. I got accepted into the Honors College and signed up for the Honors Retreat, but forgot to choose to move-in early. I emailed the UH Honors *Retreat asking about it, but I'm not sure if they'll let me move-in early? Is there any possible way that they would let me?* My roommate already signed up early, but I didn't know at the time.

To kind of go off of the housing, I'm in CV1 and *I was wondering what furniture is already available in the Honors dorms?* 

And the last question is more towards the engineering/math placement exam. I took it a while ago (my mother pretty much pushed me to take it immediately, not realizing how much later my orientation is...so I could've had more time to study) and I didn't pass. I'm not too worried about not passing it to get into Calculus 1 since I've forgotten quite a bit of Pre-Calc. *Would this put me at a disadvantage in the engineering field to redo pre-calculus my first year?* I'm going towards biomedical engineering and in the first year you start off on Calculus 1. I'm just a bit worried at how much it'll set me back.

Living on campus...smart or waste of money.,10,20,"Hi everyone! So this is a simple problem but an important one that I’m facing about whether or not I should live on campus next fall at my university. 
I live in Katy, a southwest city from Houston, and I’ve been going to a junior college for 2 years after I graduated high school. I will be transferring next fall to the University of Houston and I’ve been in an ongoing debate with my parents about whether or not I can live on campus. 

Basically, from my parents’ perspective, they think I should just commute from Katy to Houston (about 45 minutes to over a hour) everyday for class and just continue living at home with them. To save money mostly since they can’t justify helping pay for a dorm or apartment that’s only an hour away. 

From my perspective however, I’ve lived with them for so long and sacrificed going to a university right out of high school to save money, so in my eyes I’ve done my time with them. To me, I also want to experience what it’s like living on a college campus and joining clubs and such. I also am just annoyed with living with my parents and the control they try to implement over me, so I said I’d pay for whatever housing I wanted since they don’t agree with my idea. 

So yeah, am I being unreasonable in wanting to move out or should I maybe consider more what my parents said? Deep down I know I want to leave so bad, but it’s just hard to escape their influence. 

Thoughts? Advice? Please!

Edit: Thank you all so much for all your advice! Just a note; I would be paying for housing and my parents agreed to pay for the classes. At the end of the day I basically just want freedom from my parents and I feel like living on campus in Houston would allow that. I do think getting roommates would be smart and live in an apartment, I just need to weigh all my options.",bbnyi2,UniversityOfHouston

Room transfer success,1,2,"This will be my first semester at UH and I applied for housing and was put in the University Lofts, a single furnished room. Obviously, this is a nice room but it is $6,200 per semester and I do not want to pay that.

You would only have to pay for the time you spent there. I can let you know that it would be about $2257 for the rest of the semester. You would also have to buy a meal plan if you don't already have one, which is about $1200. All of your payments would be through your MyUH, just like any other dorm. You wouldn't have to pay out of pocket or anything. If you do want it, you'd have to pay a $50 application fee and sign up at the housing office.

I'm really only interested in staying in the dorms my freshman year, I'll try to apply for an RA position afterwards,  and if I don't receive it,  I will just commute.

 Total cost for dorms is $3,000 a semester +$1600 for a mandatory meal plan.  That'll put me at about $4600 a semester or $9200 a year.  


I'll have about $2200 by the end of the summer I can put in. I also plan on using my $2,000 unsubsidized loan.  And taking out $5k in private loans.

The disappointment that is Lightview. A slight rant,129,51,"So for all of you are looking to vent about how we were promised a luxury experience and received plastic couches and tiny rooms, and for everyone looking to move here in the future, let’s give some clarity into what lightview is. It’s an apartment that is essentially a dorm room that you pay significantly more for. Because you need to have your own renters insurance, lightview isn’t liable for a lot of things that could go wrong. The rooms are much smaller than we were led to believe and you can’t tell that the building was put up in less than 2 years. The walls are paper thin so you better hope that your neighbors aren’t loudly fucking all the time. Starting at the end of next week, we not only will have to tap in through the front door, and at the security desk. We will also need to tap to operate the elevators. You can hear the water running through the walls when anybody above you flushed the toilet or showers and they are already beginning to change their policies. Northeastern is now requiring that lightview change their policy on signing in guests and they are also changing their strange, but welcomed smoking in the rooms policy. The kitchens have almost no storage and although the closets are large, the credenzas are not, so be sure to bring your own storage solution. The beds are large but stiff so a mattress pad is probably a necessity, and the lights are on motion sensors so be sure to turn them off before going to bed or you’ll be turning all the lights on in the apartment when you get up to use the bathroom. The nicest and largest rooms are definitely the 4 bedroom, 4 bath, but the kitchen has no more space than a smaller room arrangement. The facilities are nice, but I emailed 3 times about the on site gym to see if it would be fully equipped with free weights and every time they assured me it would be. The gym has no free weight bench set or squat rack. There is one smith machine and dumbbells that only go up to 75 pounds. This is likely for safety reasons so the gym can be open 24/7 but still. I was excited to have an on site bench press. The WiFi is very good, but still slower than promised and I have yet to try out the cable package. Overall, a lot of us are downgrading from our on campus housing and are spending a lot more money. Yeah it comes fully furnished, but it’s really shitty furniture and the cable and internet packages are nice, but still not worth the up to $1800 per month price tag on the most expensive rooms. For much cheaper, I could’ve gotten off campus housing that I would’ve been much happier in. Hopefully this year will fly by because I will not be resigning next September.",cvqypf,NEU

Worried & Stressed - Was I a Jerk to my roommate??,25,33,"I want to know if I messed up or if I am an asshole. I’m a freshman and this all happened two nights ago.


Thursday night my roommate had some people over to drink in our dorm room. I’m not much of a drinker, and I didn’t want to get in any trouble, so I left our room and went to the common room to FaceTime my girlfriend from home. Around an hour later I hear my roommate and his friends leave, so I go back into the room. He left a mess, beer bottles and half drank liquor bottles scattered around (including on my desk). I took the stuff he left on my desk and put them on top of his bed.


Around 1:15AM he comes back into the room, turns on the lights, and I wake up. I can tell he is realllllly drunk. He tries to have a conversation with me and he is slurring his words. He must have noticed I put the stuff atop his bed because he grabbed his pillow and a blanket and feel asleep on the floor. 


I was really worried, and after texting a few friends from home I decided that I was going to get the RA to tell them that my roommate was super drunk. I didn’t want him to die or anything. The RA comes to the room and asks me what I know. I explain everything I’ve explained above. The RA says the right thing to do is call NUPD. I ask if this would be covered by medical amnesty and she said “it should, but I don’t know.” 


NUPD shows up and wakes him up. The ask him a bunch of questions and he doesn’t really answer any of them. Just says he wants to go to sleep. NUPD sees all the liquor bottles around the room and took photos. They also look at his wallet and see that he has a fake ID inside (I did not know he had this). Ultimately NUPD ends the whole convo with my roommate signing a waiver thing. He goes to sleep. I can barely sleep because I’m so shaken up. 


The next morning my roommate wakes up and says “bro did you fucking call the cops on me?” I said I didn’t (which is technically true because it was the RA who called). He seems upset, moves the stuff I put on his bed, and falls back asleep as I go to my class.


When I get back to my dorm around 4:00 my roommate asks why I made such a big deal, says he was completely fine, and he seems really angry. I didn’t know what to say, and I casually mentioned he shouldn’t be in trouble because of medical amnesty. He didn’t like this answer.


What I think happened yesterday during the day is he got called to the NUPD HQ and maybe had a chat with the RA? I only think this because I kinda overheard him talking to one of his friends in the bathroom.


I’m worried my roommate is going to hate me for the entire year. My intention wasn’t to get him in a bunch of trouble. Sure I was mad about the trash and being woke up, but I hope he doesn’t get sent to OSCCR.

Room Checks - The Truth,0,10,"Hello r/NEU - as a current Residence Director I want to take a moment to set the record straight concerning room checks.

RAs will be conducting room checks for around a two week period. They will enter you room in pairs, look around, and document any infractions. Some infractions will result in immediate action (I.E - if you leave out a bong, you’ll be meeting with me real fast), and some will be documented with the resident having the ability to “fix” the issue, and have their room rechecked. 

Additionally, in more apartment style dorms if the RA sees a smoke detector has been removed - they are instructed to call NUPD immediately. Fires are a serious threat.

I have seen some RA commenters on previous posts saying they are pretty lenient. Yes, RAs are told not  to open your fridge or drawers during room checks (though RDs and NUPD Can do this at anytime), though please understand that RAs are not going to put their employment at risk to be cool to you during a room check.

Lastly, there are reasons the Guide to Residence Hall living exists. I have seen firsthand how destructive a fire can be. And yes, string lights have caused fires. You can google it.",debopm,NEU

I will do this mainly because it's an easier college to get into than business and I can diversify my classes more. Anyways, I have a few questions that I would hope some of you would answer. I realize this sub will be a little biased, obviously, and I'm okay with that - but please try to point out both positives AND negatives.

1) Did the LLC's help you at all regarding making friends at the beginning of freshman year or is it just another selling point that really doesn't help you?

2) Are CO-OPs worth it? As an econ major do they pay well and is it relatively easy to obtain a job after graduation?

3) Are the dorm rooms worse, average, or better than a typical freshman college dorm room? And is the food worse, average, or better than other colleges? 

4) How often do you go to hockey games? Is there alot of attendance typically and is there atleast some school spirit?

5) I realize the campus is in the middle of the city - is there a sense of community within Northeastern?

6) What do you do in Boston in your free time?

I moved on Monday, 3 nights ago, into Willis Hall, and every night I wake up with these small, red, itchy bug bites. Over the past 3 nights I have accumulated a grand total of 28 bites over my arms and legs and even around my waist. I've contacted the RD after two nights and the inspection person told me today that it is not bedbugs or fleas, but I've been bitten by mosquitos and I know that this is not that problem. I also don't think spiders would bite so often at once.

Wow, it can be so hard to keep my head up sometimes. I'm usually pretty good at burying down the loneliness, the helplessness, the depression—but then something triggers it all at once. Something innocuous, like people laughing together at the dining hall, or seeing someone I know, someone I tried to befriend, hanging out with their friends. It’s weird, because I’ve never been entirely alone. There’s someone I talk to in class, a few people I see weekly for a club, but I’m never one of the group. I’m never going to be the person who’s on your mind when you’re thinking of making plans. I’m the person who crosses your mind when your girlfriend is busy, when your roommates are busy, when the rest of your friends at busy, when there’s nothing you should be studying, when—I don’t know, maybe your bed isn’t comfortable enough for a nap? I don’t blame anyone. I wouldn’t choose to hang out with me if I had any other option. 

And I know that it’s on me, too. I can’t sit around and wait to be invited to stuff, right? I have to take initiative. And I did, I tried, I tried so, so hard, at least for a while. I propped my dorm room door open, I sat in common spaces and tried to make small talk, I joined clubs, I went to dorm events, I talked to people in my classes, but nothing ever clicked. I’ve gotten close. There were a few people in my club that I really resonated with, and I ended up hanging out with them outside the club, just stuff like going to lunch together or putting on a movie. But somehow, for some reason, I could never integrate into their group. I’m always the acquaintance-friend. The second choice. I actually almost dated one of them, but he ended up choosing a different girl instead. Always the second choice.  Even after my feelings moved on, I’ve never felt as comfortable around him as I used to, because being around him now sometimes reminds me of how unwanted I am. That’s actually what triggered this post. I opened a snap of a few people from the club, him included, and saw them and his girlfriend just having a great fucking time together, and it makes me so angry at myself because what’s wrong with me that prevents me from having that moment? Not even with them specifically, but with anyone here. Because that is what college is supposed to be, right? The sparks of life that you share with people you care about in between work and school? What is it that bars me from those moments?  

Maybe I’d feel better if I loved what I was doing here, but I don’t. Well, I enjoy most of my classes, for the most part, as much as you can enjoy memorizing amino acids, but I have no passion for the field. I’m in biology and psychology, two majors which I chose because I’ve always been good at those classes and relatively liked them, but I don’t have any goals. I don’t want to do med school, or research, or become a teacher or a professor. I don’t want to do anything, most of the time. Switching majors wouldn’t help—there’s nothing I like doing more than the majors I already have—so I just do the work and go to class in the hopes that I finally feel some iota of hope. All while trying to fight the feeling that I’m just wasting money and time and oxygen by being here. I’m here out of obligation, because there’s no better alternatives. But I’m not wanted, or needed, or liked, and I don’t know how to change.",e7yqvr,UVA
UVA Dorm Distance from Central Grounds?,3,15,"Hi, I just got into UVA and am curious about the dorms and their accessibility to central grounds by foot.

3.UVA is obviously a challenging school to attend. How would you describe student life in the campus? Do you think the students there are generally supportive of each other? Do you find yourself constantly burdened by academics or having a relative amount of free time to do the activities you enjoy?

General advice for all incoming Baby Hoos,104,19,"I just commented most of this under different posts, but I just wanted to provide any assistance I could to all of the incoming First Years Hoo may be a bit nervous as move-in weekend rapidly approaches.

If you have any other questions or need anything else - feel free to DM me. That goes for all first years reading this! Hoos have each other's backs. You've picked the right school, I promise.  I mean, [this hunk](https://external-preview.redd.it/OMTWSNeCOxPRvCfJKhWBLZLgazGywS7un1GktjX4KBE.jpg?auto=webp&s=8860317997055440ac124db7263a5e95500d8ed9) is your basketball coach... how could you not love this place?

&#x200B;

A few general tips I have always given people:

* Other first years are just as nervous as you. Suggest some activity to do as a group (eat a meal, play catch with a Frisbee, explore Grounds, etc.) and there's a 99% chance everyone will be totally down to join you.
* Introduce yourself to anyone and everyone. My friends and I used to call it first year fever. You can literally go up to any other first year, introduce yourself and within 5 minutes, you're having lunch together, have a class in common or something. Everyone will be super, super friendly since they're all in the same situation.
* Make friends with your RA. They are there as a resource and they WANT to be there and build a community on your hall. Many of the RAs are giving up living with their friends off-Grounds to be in a first year dorm. They are passionate about res-life and usually try to organize events on a weekly basis.
* Whenever you are in your room, prop your door open. There is no easier way to meet everyone on your hall as they walk up and down the hallway.
* On the first day of each class, introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you and exchange phone numbers. If you miss a class or have a question about homework, having a number of someone else in class can be a useful source of info.
* The friends you make during the first weeks and months are most likely not the friends you'll have during fourth year. Be patient and know that you'll find your place. I promise you! You'll find a family at UVA, everyone does. It just takes some time.
* Sometime before classes start, walk around Grounds and map out you daily schedule to see where you'll be walking each day.
* Go to all the events you can! Completely immerse yourself into the UVA way of life. Go to Rotunda Sing, Tom Deluca, etc. Here is the [schedule](https://orientation.virginia.edu/wahoo-welcome-2019) for the Wahoo welcome events. Unlike many high schools where it's ""not cool"" to try or be involved (or whatever you want to call it), UVA is home to the best and brightest. Embrace everything first year has to offer and it will embrace you.
* Go to the activities fair and sign up for all the clubs that interest you!  You don't have to commit to any of them, but it's a great way to get a taste of what UVA CIOs can offer.
* It's perfectly normal to be nervous! Go in with a positive attitude. There will be good and bad times, but with a positive attitude, you can bounce back from anything life throws at you! Enjoy and Go Hoos!

&#x200B;

Last minute things to bring with you as you move into your dorm:

A bit of snack food to keep in your dorm. You never know when you might be hungry and the dining hall is closed.

* A [doorstop](https://www.amazon.com/Foot-Doorstop-Gray-Pack-00941/dp/B00006IATM) \- Keep your door propped open. It's the best way to get to know everyone on your hall as they walk to/from class. My first year RA gave everyone on the hall a doorstop and it was the best thing he could have ever done. None of us ever ate at the dining halls alone. Someone would always be walking down the hall sticking their heads in everyone's rooms wanting to go to dinner.
* It sounds silly, but school supplies and notebooks. I was dumbfounded by how many people on my hall First Year were running out to buy notebooks and pencils the day before classes.
* A small bluetooth speaker - super versatile. Can be used anywhere from soft study music in your dorm, to hanging out outside or on The Lawn. Speakers aren't your thing? Bring a nice set of headphones to dampen out some of the noise if you're trying to study.
* A set of utensils and 1 or 2 plates... You order some take out food? You bring some food home from O'hill? How are you going to eat it?
* A couple recreational activities. Whatever floats your boat: Frisbee, football, XBox, boardgames, a bike, running shoes, etc. You can't do schoolwork 24/7
* Sweatshirts and jackets - I know you probably would bring them eventually, but C'ville has crazy temperature changes within a day and it's not uncommon for September mornings to be chilly enough to require a jacket. So bring them now as opposed to after you go home for Fall break or so.
* A daily organizer. I didn't have one for my first two months. And after I got one, it changed my life... no more forgotten assignments, no more quizzes I forgot the date for, it kept me super, super organized.",cu87iz,UVA

Just got my first year housing assignment back,10,20," McCormick Road Triple first year....I'm pretty disappointed not gonna lie.

My first choice selections were double suite new dorms, but I got a triple hall renovated old dorm. I looked at the floor plan and its only 3 feet wider than a double room and I think the 3 of us have to share 2 drawers. I know I can't get everything I wanted since dorm space is limited but, I still wasn't able to get a single one of my first choice selections.

&#x200B;

So my question is, is there any way to switch housing assignments before or after the semester starts if vacancies appear (in the email it said no vacancies are available right now)? Should I email them? Talk to my counselor person at orientation? I have no idea. Some friends who are rising second years at UVA have been sending me nonstop Ls since the assignment came out...I really want at least just a double room, although suite would be ideal (seriously doubt that one since I heard there's very limited space for suite). But from what I've been hearing, it seems like I'll have to live with what they gave me.

Printer for E-School?,2,2,"I'll be a first year next year in the school of engineering and was wondering if I should bring a printer to my dorm (I'm in Malone). Does the e-school have a lot of papers, essays, or assignments where we need to print to justify bringing a printer? On the other hand, I'm in Malone, which is quite a distance away from the main grounds areas, so would a printer be beneficial?",c80q0f,UVA
Did anyone see the crazy man walking around Emmet last night?,38,9,"I was walking to my CS exam, when up ahead of me on the sidewalk was a heavyset, bearded guy in a brown jacket and dark cap just kind of staring at a lamppost. The closer I got to him, the stronger that gut feeling that something was off got; I had the feeling that I was about to become the subject of the next Timely Warning email. As I got closer to him, he broke eye contact with the lamp and looked at me with a deranged smile. He said something that I couldn't understand. I'm still not sure if he was speaking another language or if it was just gibberish. I slowed down in hopes that he would leave, but he held his ground so I just walked around him. I quickened the pace a little, but kept my eye on him. Whenever I looked at him, he would stare right back. My memory's a little blurry, so I don't remember if he followed me for a bit at first, but at some point he pulled in front of me. I didn't want to get shanked, so I decided I'd cross to the other, more well-lit side of Emmet.  He looked at me while I was crossing, but thank Jefferson he decided not to follow. I kept walking while keeping an eye on him, and saw him look over a couple of times. Eventually he starts walking a bit faster. Not much later, he randomly jumps in the bike lane and sticks out his arm, kind of like a hitchhiker.  He stumbles for a bit longer, until he's literally in the middle of Emmet. He almost gets hit by a couple of cars, but makes it to the other side, at one point stopping and stumbling around in his hitchhiker's pose. When he reaches the McCormick bridge over Emmet, he decides to turn around and start walking the other way. I reported this to the police, but when I called back later to offer them a photo I took, they didn't really tell me what happened.

UVA 2023 Housing Questions,3,3,"Hello! I was recently admitted to the class of 2023 and am pretty set on going.

I also heard that all the old dorms are being renovated too which makes the choices even better.

AMA 2019-2020 Housing at International Residential College,4,5,"Are you a prospective first year, transfer, or current UVA student who needs housing for the 2019-2020 school year? Then the International Residential College (IRC) may be the place for you! We are home to 317 residents from all backgrounds. We are made up of 30% international, 70% domestic students (many of whom are from out of state). Many languages are spoken within the IRC.

If you are a prospective first year or transfer student, you will apply through the housing portal.

If you are a current uva student, then we still have some spaces open left over from the normal application pool as we admit on the basis of the quality of the application and fit of the applicant, not on filling spaces. If you believe that you would be a good fit for our last remaining spaces, then please email housingassignments@virginia.edu to be out in official contact with me with regards to your application. Please DM me with any questions at all about the IRC or the application!


*Accommodations*
Mary Munford is the only dorm/building on grounds that has a mailroom, laundry room, and printer (all in one!). There’s a ping pong table, study spaces (rooms that you can actually reserve to take tests, etc.), kitchens for each hall. There’s a main kitchen that you can reserve in the first floor of Mary Munford for events that you want to hold. In fact, you can use the IRC or RA budget to hold your own events, which is great! Many residents have taken advantage of this to celebrate their own cultures/backgrounds. Our board game and library collections are quite extensive too!

*WEEKLY EVENTS*
We have weekly food events (of course!)
3 breakfasts (monday muffins, wednesday petite dejeuner, Friday bodos bagels--the best bagels out there), and then thursday tea time. We also have The Week That Was (political discussions about the past week with snacks), which is our longest running tradition at the IRC. I ran it last spring semester, and it’s always really lit.

*Typical semesterly events*
Then there are also the IRC's monthly fancy dinner parties called Conversazion Grande dinners, weekly lunches that you can sign up for with IRC fellow professors and random professors that the IRC recruits (with food from the garden room, so it's good), laissez lire (book club) dinners, language club events, pop up cafes (random and quite unpredictable). We also have sporadic intramural sports competitions and cultural movie nights. But wait! There’s more! We also have ""out and abouts"" which are events where the IRC dean or principal takes us out to different places around Cville (plays, movies, etc.) or beyond (like I'm going to Poplar Forest pretty soon) for free, which is super fun.

*Seasonal/Holiday events*
CultureMonth events happen in the fall (different cultural/ethnic organizations appearing to perform/celebrate their cultures) throughout September. We always do Thanksgiving, which is super big (every hall makes their own dishes. We tend to do Japan Day with Japan Club, but aren’t this year. We’re currently planning on hosting a Holi Celebration (with powder throwing, catered Indian food, and s'mores to follow) with HSC and ISA, which will be phenomenal. New this spring semester is IRC Day (which is like IRC month from the fall but part two and in the spring). We had a cute Murder Mystery event that we hosted and invited kids from the other res. colleges. There’s a spring ping pong tournament coming up. I think we're also doing a Merienda (light snacks and music) event with Spanish house. We also just had an event this semester on discussing race and identity at UVA following recent events that happened at UVA and in Virginia (http://www.nbc29.com/clip/14758062/where-do-we-go-from-here-chaos-or-community-event-held-on-uva-grounds). We’re planning *low key* on having an event about Brexit, all arranged by the IRC’s principal, Reid Bailey. We had a Talking Traditions event in the fall semester, munching on a weird marshmallow-graham-crackers-brownies mixture that I made while talking about going home and what we tend to do, religiously or otherwise, with our families.

*Unofficial fun that we have*
We have a lot of unofficial things; but the first years this year have nerf wars all of the time. We also have a lot of ping pong tournaments and random discussions/monopoly games in the ~fishbowl~ at late hours of the morning. There are many FIFA tournaments in the ~Klazzroom~. 

*Fun facts*
Did you know? The IRC is very committed to sustainability. In fact, we compost the most out of all of the dorms/res colleges on grounds (many of them don’t even compost).
We are the newest residential college on grounds! But we’re still rocking it!

*HOO are we looking for?*
We look for people who are open to multiculturalism, seem like they will get involved/benefit from IRC events, and understand the values of the IRC (diversity, integrity, openness, inclusion, expression of oneself and one's culture).

Setting up Chromecast in the dorms,3,9,"Hello, I recently purchased a Chromecast and I'm having a bit of trouble setting it up in my dorm.

A Note to First Years about On-Grounds Housing,38,21,"Hello first-years. I know talk about housing fills the walls of Newcomb, dorms, and wherever else you young kids gather these days. I want to pass along a friendly note about living on Grounds after your first year. A few things:

1. HRL says it's cheaper: Ehhhhhhhh. Depends. If you are comparing it to Uncommon, the Flats, one another one of those bougie places, sure. Do consider that even though the rent might seem cheaper than some budget Off Grounds options, you only have access to the apartment for 200ish days instead of the usual 365 day lease. Go and break down the rent for on Grounds housing to a per day rate then multiply it by 365. I find this as a better way to compare rents. Do, of course, remember that rent off-Grounds housing sometimes does and does not include utiltites, so make sure to factor that in as well. One thing that on Grounds rent sure doesn't include is...
2. Parking. You will pay $414 to have your car on Grounds for the academic year. Again, this is less compared to some places on the Corner but there are many off Grounds options that don't charge you this ridiculous amount of money to park on a piece of asphalt that is never maintained other than for a Parking and Transportation staff member to come five minutes before the parking restrictions are lifted and write your friends who are visiting you a parking ticket. 
3. If you live in Faulkner or Copeley, the whole idea of staying connected to the UVA community is a lie. Living in either of those places is so isolating because sure, you are technically still on Grounds, but unless you are friends with lots of Darden and Law students, you sure are going to feel extremely separated from the UVA community just because you are so far away from everything. 

I hope this helps. ",9io5tm,UVA

Help! I'm in Housing Hell!,2,17,"Hey y'all,

Like the overdramatic title says, I need some help with housing for next year. I am a current first-year and am thinking about where I will live next year. I've already narrowed it to Copely, Faulkner, and Brandon houses. I also want to apply to be an RA.

&#x200B;

So how does this work? I haven't really made any close friends here (just some friends here and there in classes, people I always say hi to around Grounds, I know, it's lame as hell) so I don't really have anyone to sign a lease with on any off-Grounds housing or room with for on-Grounds housing. I don't like my current roommate and I know already she is rooming with friends. 

&#x200B;

So what do I do? Should I apply both to the houses I named above AND to be an RA at the same time (I know RA's live in the dorm they are RA's for)? Is it still possible to go random for roommate? When should I start applying? Should I wait until I meet a few more people to make a decision?

Incoming UVA First-Year looking for some housing advice,12,10,"This August, I'll be attending UVA, and I'm beyond excited to get the ball rolling.  That being said, with housing applications opening up soon, I wanted to get some input from current/former students on housing options.

First off, while I am a first year, I'll be coming in as a veteran. I was only in for 3 years (I'm 22) so I don't think the age gap will be as big of an issue for me as it could be.  We had the option to live on or off grounds.  I don't necessarily like to go out and party 24/7, but I am a social person and I love meeting and interacting with new people and developing a large social circle so I felt like living on grounds was the best choice for me.

While graduate housing was an option, from what I gather, it's not very close to much so I don't think I'll strongly consider that.

I had the opportunity to speak to some current residents of Brown, and I really like the idea of living there for the culture and the location.  Beyond that however, I'm not 100% sure what people who are familiar with the different housing options recommend.

Just something to consider, I'm able to mark first-year or upperclassman housing options as a preference (I don't know how much they'll take that into consideration), but I think that upperclassman housing seems like a better bet, unless there's a really solid reason why I should go the first-year route.

Questions from a prospective Hoo,8,6,"So I was recently admitted as a second year transfer for SEAS \(yay!\) and plan on declaring CS. I was also admitted to VT for engineering so I'm trying to decide between the two. I've done a bunch of research on the programs of both schools and I've realized that they're both fantastic institutions for my major and my success is going to come down to what I do in school more than which school I pick. I'm mostly basing my decision on the lifestyle I want in college and the cost. So I've listed a bunch of questions and appreciate if you all could answer any of them.

1. What's the running culture like in Cville/UVA? Are there good running routes around campus. Are there places I can run safely at night \(I'm a tall white guy\)?
2. Is there any fun stuff to do on weekends that don't involve drinking/drugs?
3. I've heard pretty unanimous agreement that UVA's dining isn't the best. Are there enough good restaurants on/close to grounds that you can mostly avoid dining hall food? Isn't there like one good dining hall? Furthermore are there any affordable/accessible grocery stores so that I could make my own food?
4. Is the fratty/preppy culture as prevalent as everyone says?
5. How's Charlottesville's public transit? Is it a big inconvenience if you don't have a car?
6. What's a brief summary of the different areas there are to live off grounds? 
7. To people who transfered: How was the transfer process? Smooth/Rough? Anything I should keep in mind my first few weeks?
8. I'm planning on visiting within the next few days. I know you're all in finals so I was planning on mostly showing myself around. Anything I should keep my eye out for / check out regarding my above questions? 

Some information I'd want to add is that I'm transferring from a private 4 year school. UVA is instate for me and I already have a bunch of friends that go there. I have a friend who is also transferring and probably will room with them. I'm leaning towards UVA just because I'm from nova and I'd like to stay not too far from home. I also feel like I'd enjoy living in Charlottesville over Blacksburg. I greatly appreciate any information you all can give me. ",8gfahu,UVA

Considering Lakeside Apartments next year,3,11,"So, I’m in Rawlings this year. As much as I enjoy the location, I’m not a big fan of it. Always a weird new smell everyday and it’s old af. But I mean, even if I wanted to live here again there have been rumors of it being torn down next year. 


I’ve been looking at options and honestly, Lakeside seems so much better and it’s only a couple hundred dollars more per semester than Rawlings, which makes me feel pretty dumb now. I know the distance is comparatively far, but is it that bad? I know buses run frequently but has anyone had trouble getting to classes on time? Worst case scenario I can just bike. I don’t have a car btw.


I have plenty of time to weigh my options and I’ve heard that some obscure dorms like Simpson and East are also nice. Might consider Broward too, it’s the only other dorm I’ve actually been in and it’s already leagues better than Rawlings. I will be a second year next year. Not that I’m antisocial, but the social aspect of dorms isn’t a high priority to me. Aside from my roommates, I haven’t made any friends in Rawlings. I like the idea of Lakeside since I could have my own room, potentially nice roommates to talk to, and it’s close to Southwest Rec.

Now my question is: can I dorm at the Manhattan campus while taking most of my classes at Tandon? I know it'll be a lot of travelling back and forth but I don't mind.",bd5jm9,nyu
How to print at your dorm?,1,1,"So I asked my RA when I first got to NYU this summer on how to print from the dorm printer at Goddard.

"Commuters and NYU dorm residents, help a girl out!",3,6,"Hi!

I was accepted to Stern BPE off the waitlist. I wasn’t offered any financial aid, but I am gracious to have parents that are willing to shoulder some of the costs. 

Now, I’m just split between if I want to dorm or commute. I am from the southeastern part of the US, but I have some family that lives in Queens. If I decide to do the 1 hr per way commute, I would live with them and save $20,000.

At same time, I really want to dorm because I am extremely awkward and just ridden with social anxiety. I feel that commuting would make it hard for me to reach out and make friends. Since I’m not from NYC, I’m not used to the long commutes and am wondering if that will take a toll on my time to study or limit me from getting involved. I also just really want a traditional college feel by living at NYU especially since NYU is already so open.

Clark Street Dorm,26,2,"I've noticed there is essentially no discussion about Clark Street on r/nyu or anywhere else, so I thought I'd list some things I've learned after living there.

This is going to be from the perspective of a CAS student. I'll be directly comparing Clark Street with Rubin Hall because I have experience with both, because many others have experience with Rubin, and because they have similar amenities. Specifically, I'll be comparing the Clark Street Low Cost Room for 3 in Studio (LCR3) with the Rubin Low Cost Room for 3 in Studio (LCR3). 

Clark Street Overview

1. The LCR3 in Clark costs $5,919 per semester. At Rubin, $4,250.00
2. The room I currently have in Clark is approx. 25% smaller than the room I had in Rubin.
3. The Clark bathroom is approx. 75% larger than the Rubin bathroom. The Clark bathroom countertop is colossal compared to the 1 square foot ceramic fishbowl in the Rubin bathrooms.
4. Speaking of bathrooms, there is not a single public restroom in all of Clark. If you plan to spend any time in the Clark common areas, you may need to travel 8 floors to pee...
5. ...if you can make it in time. One of the two elevators is never actually in service. 
6. Clark Street is actually just one section of a larger dorm called EHS St. George Towers. EHS (Educational Housing Services) is a private ""non-profit"" organization that does not care about your feelings and especially not your financial woes. Fortunately for NYU students, our rooms costs less than it does for everyone else. Non-NYU students pay $7000 per semester for the exact same room that I pay $5900 for.
7. Considering the dorm is filled with students from other schools, it's not surprising that there isn't much of a community. On a not so related note, I have seen my RA once in person. Briefly.
8. Rooms in Clark Street DO NOT have kitchens. There is 1 communal kitchen with 7 or 8 stoves for the countless legions of residents. It's usually packed and always repulsively filthy. Think the trash collection area on Greene St behind Weinstein. 
9. So far I have yet to meet another CAS student here. There must be at least a couple others. I think. I hope. I'm very lonely please help.
10. I don't know if this reflects poorly on Clark, but my current roommates are easily the worst I have ever had. I mean, everyone talks to themselves occasionally, but very few have terrifying whisper conversations with themselves at all hours while choking on their own saliva and chortling insidiously.
11. Clark has heat and air conditioning, but our thermostat only turns on when it feels like it. Some nights are Saharan. Others Siberian.
12. I've recently purchased an instant pot since the kitchen is in violation of EPA toxic waste regulations. I have gained back 15 of the 50 pounds I lost.
13. The room has a small fridge and a microwave.

ADDENDUM

1. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the Route A bus stop in front of Tandon.
2. The bus takes anywhere between 18-30 mins to get to WSQP. Unless your bus driver is pulled over by two very upset policemen. Then prepare for a 40 minute trip.

That's all I have for now. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like about this paradise. I'm sure I'll think of some things to add. 

Also I would appreciate it if other Clark residents would share their opinions, considering mine may be *slightly* biased.

# The most important thing

Realize everybody is as nervous as you! College is fucking scary and everybody is trying to look more confident than they really are as they try to settle in and make friends. Don't be afraid to push yourself into engaging with as many groups and individuals as you can during the first few weeks. It might look like friend groups have already formed after only a day or two (""oh man, those guys have already grabbed dinner twice and have been playing poker all night, no way I can squeeze in now"") but everything will be very fluid for the first few months so don't worry if you haven't found your groove off the bat. Sometimes hanging out with people you don't totally 'click' with can lead you to meet people who become your true friends later on. Also don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself or coming off weird—everybody is too busy adjusting to their new environment to care. It's cliche but be yourself, campus is big enough that you'll find the right crew for your weird-ass self. 

---
# Safety

Honestly, the city (and especially the village) is pretty safe. Regardless, there's some hazards to watch out for, especially the goddamn delivery bicyclists. I really do think they're the biggest danger to NYU students right now; they'll sneak up on you at 20+mph going the wrong way on the street so please look up from your phone and look both ways. It's a touchy subject because many of them are undocumented citizens looking for stable income, speaking of which always tip in cash if you get seamless delivery to your dorm like the lazy ass you are. 


**Street Smahts** 

There are a ton of scammers on the street and people generally looking to get *something* out of you, **never** make eye contact with anyone and just keep walking. Trust me. That woman asking for $4.50 for a bus ticket home? She's there every day. Kids asking for money for their school team? There's no team. Etc, etc. New Yorkers are a jaded but very helpful bunch, if you need something don't start with ""Excuse me"" but just ask directly like ""Which way to X"".

Everything else about the safety in the city you'll have hammered into your minds so I won't touch on it. 

**Booze**

It's everywhere. We know it, the police know it, the RAs know it, and everybody sort of turns a blind eye as long as you're not being too obvious. Please don't be the kid leaving in an ambulance on a Friday night because it happens regularly. The best way to not get a hangover is to drink a glass of water between every shot or can of beer, and don't buy that disgusting ~~liquor~~ gasoline in plastic bottles or god forbid, Chateau Diana from Duane Read  (they can't legally sell wine so it's half strength ""wine product""). Shame anybody who buys that crap. 

Freshmen tend to have a ""go hard or go home"" attitude about alcohol but chilling with some wine/beer and playing boardgames or watching a movie is very underrated and usually ends up being a better time than dragging your ass to whatever shitty clubs are letting in freshmen. 

**Weed**

I'm not saying cartridges are the superior option...but cartridges are the superior option. If you get caught with one I don't know how you got into NYU, and even then you can say it's CBD and all they can do is shrug. But hey, it's NYC and the police DGAF so again, don't be dumb about it if you buy bud. Just please don't become *that kid* who is high 24/7 and lost all motivation in life.

# Money Money Money 💸

⚠️**STOP BUYING TEXTBOOKS** ⚠️

For the LOVE of GOD please check libgen.is for your books before giving any money to the greedy fucks who run the textbook racket. If that URL goes down search for 'library genesis'. If you can't find your book there, you can google ""Book Name filetype:pdf"" but if you hit a site with a survey don't bother. If you like physical copies, Bobst tends to keep some copies of textbooks used for classes so alternatively you can try to reserve it as soon as the syllabus comes out (sorry if I just ruined this for anyone). 

**Don't buy microsoft office**

Please don't spend money on Microsoft Office. Create an account with your NYU email [here](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) and once you sign in, look for [this](https://i.imgur.com/5nLjxDL.png) button to download office for free to your laptop.

**Get a credit card**

This is a bit of a weird one because it's very easy to *lose* money with one, but hear me out. Starting to build credit now and graduating with a 700+ credit score will help you out a ton when buying a car, a house, refinancing anything, etc. Not to mention you can get cashback rewards and better consumer protections, just treat it like a debit card, pay your bill every month, and don't spend what you don't have. I recommend the Discover It card, they give out $20 a year for having good grades and there's decent rewards. 

**Budget appeal**

Hidden within Albert is a budget appeal form, it's *intended* for special circumstances but I've heard of them tossing a couple thousand someone's way every semester if you just say ""yo...shit's expensive"" (well realistically it depends on your FAFSA results but mentioning the burden of college on your family/yourself typically works if those numbers are in your favor). 

---
# College Lyfe

**Go abroad** 

I initially thought I wouldn't do it but after going to London I would 100% recommend it. NYU is insanely invested in campuses overseas and it would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. It really does feel like a vacation, nobody has jobs or club leadership obligations so everybody is always down to hang out and travel. Plus the tight global campuses can give you a taste of the small college life you gave up by going here. 

**Clubs**

Absolutely join some clubs and even angle yourself for a leadership position if you find a group of people you'd like working with, I didn't do this as much as I'd like and I do regret it. On the flip side, don't spread yourself too thin and only have one foot in the water—you're not doing yourself or anybody else any favors then. 

**Long Distance Relationships UwU**

I'm not pretending to be an expert but I've seen some nasty breakups between long-distance couples in college, mostly in the first semester. But I've also seen some successes and even an engagement so don't give up if you think you have something special. Just be real with yourself and your partner, if you're not rock solid before college it's probably not the best move to keep it going, people change during college and trying to cling to something just because you've already put in so much time/effort only leads to pain. 

**Don't stand in the fucking way**

Space is tight in NYC and if you or a group of people stand around on a busy sidewalk or after getting through a door/escalator/elevator you'll become the most hated person on the planet for a moment. Please have some situational awareness.

Single dorm,9,4,So as a junior I had a terrible room selection time and did not get a choice in the room I wanted which would be a single.Unfortunately  somehow the school gave me the same roommate I had during the summer program I was in before my freshmen year started.She would bring her boyfriend at random hours and I would frequently come to my room to find the door locked among other issues.So is there any chance I could somehow get a single at this point?I was really looking forward to going back to school and now I'm not.,994fov,nyu

Lafayette Vent Gap,13,11,"Hey guys,

I just got placed in a Laf single and was wondering how bad the noise/light leakage is with the ventilation gap?

Also, wtf is the point of an unfinished wall? Especially in such an expensive dorm. Obviously we all know NYU loves to take money for things that should be half the cost but jesus that’s ludicrous.",d45myw,nyu

1st Year Undergraduate Dorming/Housing,6,6,"Do newly admitted freshmen have to submit the $500 SIR and $1,000 housing deposit before they can access the application for freshmen on-campus living?

Does anyone have any recommendations for freshmen dorms and how low-cost dorming differs from regular cost? I've heard that Lipton/Hayden is the nicest but also the hardest to get into because a lot of people want to stay there and I've also been given mixed reactions about Rubin. ",8db6eh,nyu
West 13th Street Residence Hall (Senior House),15,2,"I know this is called Senior housing but is this ONLY open to seniors?

If I am a second year student, and there’s a senior at West 13th willing to do a room exchange, will I be allowed to make the switch?

I couldn’t find a clear answer on the website.

Thanks!",csiwf7,nyu

I'm a high schooler thinking about applying to LSP btw.",co45xp,nyu
Dorming/Smoking,0,18,"Hello NYU. Im going to be an incoming freshman 2018-19. I've been living in California all my life and smoking weed has become a lifestyle. Not something I can give up overnight. I NEED to smoke before bed every night, or else I'm up all night. I intend on having 1 roommate. Where can I live with the peace of mind smoking in my room? I don't know what priorities freshmen got in room selections, but I got Lipton, Brittany, and University as my top choices. Best tips on where to stay and how to stay safe? Top floor? Bottom Floor? Middle? Will RAs come by a lot? Help! Also, where are all my fellow smokers at?",87epk5,nyu

How do I make as an introvert (I’m not super introverted, just find it hard to confront people. After I know someone well enough, I’ll converse with them in a normal manner)?
