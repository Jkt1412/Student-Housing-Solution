Help with choosing private housing for next year,0,5,"18 year old Freshman with no experience in shopping for apartments here

I wanted to look for some apartments, just explore around with different options for now to look at different rates and stuff and get an idea.

Housing choice dilemma,0,6,"Ok so I'm an incoming freshman and when I applied for housing I had the choice to apply to Nugent because I'm in the honors program and that's what I put as my first choice, and guess what, I actually got in!

Unfortunately, I was too late in responding to that email and accepting the offer, they said spots were already filled, so I got a room in Taft van doren fourth floor instead lol

But now they're saying spots opened up at Nugent and I can get a room there if I call by 12 tomorrow. Normally I'd accept that in a heartbeat but now I already bonded some with my roommate, we signed our roommate contract and he's a pretty cool guy so now I don't wanna leave that and be with someone who I might not get along with as well. 

Also I'm not sure if the advantages of Nugent over TVD really matter that much. I can live without AC plus I don't plan on staying in my room that much anyway and I guess climbing  three flight of stairs I'll eventuality get used to it so it can't be that bad

Seeking Early January 2020 House and Pet Sitter,6,0,"My wife and I are looking for a house and pet sitter. We're out of town regularly, so this can become a recurring gig. **But applicants _must_ be available from 1/3/2020 through 1/13/2020.** Please send me a private message if interested. Prior experience and references required. We pay fairly generously, and you get to spend time in a nice house with sweet animals.

We live in a quiet neighborhood walking distance from downtown Champaign. Campus can be reached by bike or bus, although it's probably best if you have a car. Our home has comfortable guest accommodations; fast Wifi; a well-equipped kitchen; a large television with several streaming subscriptions; a multi-room stereo system and record player for your vinyl; and a claw-foot bathtub for soaking. It's a lovely place to relax and far enough from campus to feel away.

You'll be sharing the house with two sweet animals: Chuchu, a 15 year-old 40 lb mixed-breed dog; and Xyz, and a 3 year-old Tortoiseshell cat. Chuchu will take you on twice-daily walk down to West Side Park and back, ensure that you feed and medicate him, and snuggle with you at night. But other than that he's old and sleeps a lot. Xyz also likes to snuggle, although she tends to like to snuggle _best_ when you are trying to read or work and she has an opportunity to get in the way.

If you're planning on being around for a few semesters this could become a regular gig. We're usually out of town for short trips at least a few times each semester, and pay more for shorter stints.",dudcr1,UIUC

MASSMAIL - Addressing Anti-Semitism,51,103," Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,

I am disheartened to share news of more incidents that challenge our fundamental values of tolerance and inclusion.

On Monday, a swastika was found in the Foreign Languages Building. An investigation has been launched and is on-going.

In addition, concerns were raised about a recent presentation with anti-Semitic content at a staff development program by a Housing student-worker. Housing staff have been meeting individually with all who were present to understand fully the presentation and the nature of the conversations that followed.

I want to state publicly and unequivocally that acts and expressions of anti-Semitism are acts and expressions of hatred and discrimination that are in direct opposition to our core values. Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. We will always recognize the rights of those on the campus to safely and freely express their perspectives and opinions. But we will also be ready to condemn statements and actions that violate our shared values and seek to demean, intimidate or devalue others in our community.

This presentation was offered in a regularly scheduled, staff development program on diversity for Housing Resident Advisors that included 11 other student-employees and one full-time staff member. This exercise was part of a university program created to help students learn to share diverse ideas and perspectives that lead to new understanding. Instead of fostering dialogue, it incited division, distrust and anger. The program allowed our students to enter an extremely challenging and potentially volatile situation without the preparation, training, education and professional oversight they needed to succeed. This is inexcusable and unacceptable. This is a failure to our students, and that is my responsibility.

I apologize to all of our students and to our community. This university promises an experience that prepares students to live, work and lead in a multicultural, diverse and international society. We did not live up to our obligations in this case. We are taking immediate action to ensure that, going forward, our programs and initiatives position our students for success.

Those actions include:

* The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has initiated an immediate, full review of the hiring, training and professional oversight and management processes of our Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates.
* We are instituting anti-Semitism training for all full-time Housing staff, Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates. This training will be in place by the end of this semester.
* We will commission an external review of our University Housing multicultural educational programs to help us identify and to implement best practices based on leading national peers.

I want to assure all of our students, staff, faculty and community that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents of anti-Semitism, racism, bias and prejudice on this university. We will continue to track, investigate and address incidents swiftly.

The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with faculty, students and staff to create a positive climate.

Sincerely,

Robert J. Jones

Cancel Housing Contract Update + More Advice?,4,7,"Hi,

Some of you may remember me as the <18 transfer student who signed a housing contract and was trying to get out of it from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/b46amy/is_there_any_way_i_can_still_cancel_a_housing/?st=jupscrp6&sh=e01c7929) post.

Anyways so I literally just sucked it up and accepted that I made a mistake, and that I'll be living at University Housing next year. Also the dorm I picked (Nugent) was really nice so even though I felt like I'm wasting my money, it was at least nice to be in one of the nicer, better dorms. I was a James Scholar so I didn't think it'd be a problem for me to be in the honors dorm. I was able to sign up with no problem in early February and that seemed like the plan for next semester.

Except I got an email last Thursday (April 18) that I was ineligible to be in Nugent and that I needed to contact some email so they can help me ""be reassigned"" to some other dorm.

I feel a bit annoyed, because one of the biggest factors for me signing the contract was that I got to be in a nice dorm like Nugent. It would have been 100% better had they told me way earlier that I was ineligible for Nugent,  because I would at least know with certainty what I was getting myself into.

Any advice on what I should do? I still don't want to be in University Housing and would love to get out of the contract, but somehow not having my chosen dorm makes it a lot worse..

I figured I didn’t know anyone so I would probably be in university housing again next year. Fortunately I found a cool roommate and an apartment next year.

Is there any way I can cancel this contract with paying a load of money now? I’m OOS and money is already tight right now :/

Have you been sick with mold-related illnesses while at the UI?,16,12,"We want to speak with you!

Despite the tone of the headline, this post is not an intro to a personal injury law commercial.

I'm reaching out from WCIA's investigative team to see if there are any students (or whomever!) on this subreddit who have lived in university-owned housing and had any issues with mold OR mold-related illnesses during that time.

We've been doing some digging into university records and it seems like this is actually fairly common occurrence, depending on which building we're talking about. It's also not completely uncommon for students to be moved from one room to another due to mold — but while we have some documents about that, all names are redacted and we don't know who any of the students are.

So!

If you're a student and you've either **a)** lived in university-owned housing and had to have mold cleaned out of your room/bathroom/etc **b)** been diagnosed with a mold-related illness while living in university-owned housing **c)** moved out of one room/building to another due to mold, please consider talking to us about your experience and how the UI handled it. We've talked to a mom about her daughter's experience, but students are the lifeblood of the UI, so we need to hear from you as well.

Post responses and sliding into our DM's are fine; we can also be reached at [target3@wcia.com](mailto:target3@wcia.com).

Insane email from Suburban Express,57,21,"Got this rambling manifesto of an email, thought people might enjoy it.

&#x200B;

Hi \*redacted\*  


OCTOBER 9 IS DEADLINE TO RECEIVE \~$20 PAYMENT  


If you haven't submitted your payment request yet, please stop what you're doing and take  
two minutes to submit your request.  


You purchased a ticket from Suburban Express in the past. Here is information regarding that  
purchase, to help you receive \~$20 - sort of a rebate. We're calling it Beer Money for  
Suburbanites. All you need to do is choose a reason and click on a link.  


Purchase Name: \*redacted\*  
Purchase Email: \*redacted\*  
Purchase Date: \*redacted\*  
Reservation: \*redacted\*  


Suburban Express has ceased operation, after being exploited, in our opinion, by corrupt,  
opportunistic Illinois Politicians Lisa Madigan and Kwame Raoul. We're not happy about that.  
But there is some good news for you. You can receive \~$20 from the $100,000 payment we're  
giving the corrupt politicians to make their predatory lawsuit go away.  


In the lawsuit, the Illinois Politicians made a wide variety of what we would characterize  
as false, inflammatory claims. We didn't have $250,000 - $500,000 to fight the lawsuit, and,  
in our opinion, that's what they were counting on when they filed it. They seemed to know  
that filing a large, slimy lawsuit full of unfounded, inflammatory claims would be very  
costly to defend against, and they seemed to know from experience that most people prefer to  
pay to get out of such a lawsuit rather than fighting -- particularly when the ""tribute""  
offered is less than the cost of defending against the lawsuit.  


Incredibly, Kwame Raoul went on to lie to the public about his lack of results after the  
lawsuit was all over. The lawsuit was settled through a written agreement and thereby  
dismissed. The written agreement specifically states that there was no finding or admission  
of wrongdoing. The agreement was a truce which both sides agreed upon. Yet Raoul squeezed  
out and pinched off a press release wherein he seemed to shamelessly brag and boast he had  
proven the various false allegations which he had most certainly not proven.  


But we digress...  


The state intends to distribute \~$20 payments to anyone who is willing to fill out a web  
form, apparently. They seem to want to be able to walk away from what is essentially a  
t-shirt cannon distribution of $20's and say, see, the fact that all those people got money  
proves that our lawsuit was righteous. But most people recognize such a ploy for what it is.  


Here's how to get your free money, likely \~$20, from the $100k Suburban Express settlement  
payment:  


1) Decide on a reason you want \~$20. Below are two reasons that we're pretty sure the AG  
would like to hear, based on our interactions with them. When AG asks you why you want \~$20,  
you can tell them:  


""I noticed that Suburban Express terms & conditions say that collection action will occur in  
Ford County, IL and now that I think about it, I don't like that.""  


or  


(Choose this reason only if you purchased a ticket after 8/25/17) ""I noticed that Suburban  
Express terms & conditions said ""online disparagement will not solve any problem you have  
and it may lead us to refuse your future business"" and that makes me want \~$20 from the  
lawsuit settlement payment.""  


2) Click on the link below. It will take you to a form that is already populated with  
information from the transaction listed at the top of this email. To complete the process,  
you'll type your name and a couple other things and click your mouse once. A little while  
later, you should receive a check in the mail.  


Afraid to click on a link in an email? No problem, just visit and scroll  
to the link at the bottom of the page.  


If you are still concerned that this is some sort of internet scam, please feel free to  
email the Illinois Attorney General's Office at They'll be happy to  
confirm that they are required to make payments to former customers like yourself.  


The Illinois Attorney General was originally required by the written agreement to send out  
payments within 40 days of October 9, 2019. But they aren't as organized and responsible as  
you might hope. As the payout date got closer and closer, they apparently started to panic.  
The elderly man in the basement who writes checks by candlelight using a quill pen is  
apparently unable to write out thousands of checks in 40 days and the State of Illinois  
apparently lacks a more efficient alternate system.  


So the political scammers from the office of Attorney General Kwame Raoul spent many hours  
of their time petitioning the court for an extension. Incredibly, the court disregarded the  
written contract between Suburban Express and the State and ordered that Kwame Raoul should  
have more time to meet the obligations that he knew he had almost six months ago.  


Kwame Raoul sent four attorneys to one of the court hearings about the extension. That meant  
about twelve man hours or more of State of Illinois attorney time per hearing, which isn't  
cheap, was devoted to asking for an extension instead of working on the payments. Suburban  
Express asked the court if the attorneys shouldn't be back at the office processing payments  
instead of sitting in the courtroom, but didn't get an answer.  


The State of Illinois is a sinking ship. There is no path out of the damage which decades of  
corrupt, incompetent leadership have caused. People are leaving the state by the thousands,  
This means that fewer and fewer people will have to cover the state's huge backlog of overdue  
bills. Tax rates are increasing and they will continue to increase.  


There are many states that are not plagued by the corruption and mismangement which afflicts  
Illinois. Did you know that Wyoming and Tennessee have NO INCOME TAX? Did you know that  
Montana has NO SALES TAX? Did you know that Indiana has a BALANCED BUDGET? There are jobs  
and affordable housing just waiting for you in these and other states.  


Get out before it's too late.  


By the way, taxpayer, do you realize that nearly \~20,000 of the \~50,000 students at the  
University of Illinois are not from Illinois? That's 40%! And about half aren't even from  
this country. According to the University of Illinois, this is the 2017 breakdown:  


China 5845  
India 1464  
Korea 1057  
Other 2468  


out of about 50,000  


To cover up the fact that University of Illinois has to pander to students from other  
countries in order to stay afloat, they have decided to call themselves Inclusive Illinois.  
We think a more accurate slogan would be Highest Bidder Illinois.  


Our opinion is that land-grant state universities like University of Illinois should focus  
their efforts on providing affordable, high-quality education to the citizens of Illinois.  


John Delorean got his automobile company into a financial crisis. He tried dealing cocaine  
to save it. We think University of Illinois should find a way out of their mess that doesn't  
involve dealing cocaine.",decmqm,UIUC

Cal student cooperative stays silent on no-whites-allowed student housing,0,24," ***Housing ‘not meant’ for white students***

A student housing group associated with the University of California, Berkeley, is staying silent regarding questions about its nonwhite “Person of Color” student housing, a facility that one official said is “not meant” for non-minority students.

The Berkeley Student Cooperative’s Person of Color House was opened in the fall of 2016 with the goal of “increas\[ing\] inclusivity for low-income students and students of color,” according to [**a report**](http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/04/reclaiming-a-safe-space/) in *The Daily Californian* at the time.

The housing option was created as part of an effort at “creating a safer, more inclusive space for historically and presently marginalized low-income students of color and those from multicultural backgrounds,” according to [**the cooperative’s website**](https://www.bsc.coop/index.php/housing/houses/medium-houses/pocth-castro). The housing is equipped with 56 bed spaces and is wheelchair accessible.

Best/Cheapest housing option to be able to cook for myself?,17,14,"I’m a freshman rn, thinkin about sophmore year and beyond. I feel like it’s stupid that I’m paying for the meal plan because the food honestly sucks here.

I heard that the Wada Apartments at unit 2 were a good option, as it’s a room of 4 or something and it gives u a kitchen too. 
I can’t really figure out what the pricing difference is, but how much would I be paying for the year in a co-op vs the apartment? 

I also heard that the co-ops like to party, drink, smoke, and are messy at times. I’d prefer to have something quiet and more secluded. As for cooking, I know how to cook and whatever, so do my friends, so I feel like it’d be better for us to just be on our own.

I talked to Katie, the director of Reshall, about reverting my contract to the 17k housing contract instead of the 21k housing. 

Katie is giving me a hard time about reverting to my 17k contract because, they don’t revert contracts and I need to prove I can’t afford it. 

What is even shittier is that my parents make enough to be considered “doing well”, but not enough for me to avoid having to take federal loans to pay for my tuition and housing.  So showing their taxes wont do me any good. The only thing I can do to prove I can’t afford the 21k is showing the loans I’ve taken to afford Berkeley. 

I am completely lost on what to do. Can someone provide me with advice on how to better handle this situation?",cvlkdm,berkeley

Physically threatened and attacked by a homeless person on Telegraph,101,20,"Today, after an uneventful year at Berkeley, I was attacked by a homeless person. I was physically threatened, shoved, and verbally abused while punches flew by inches away from my face.

I realize that this, in comparison with the dozens of unopened Nixle alerts with scary titles in my inbox, is as tame as it gets, but I really had believed that walking with a group of people on Game Day at 8 in the morning should have prevented this from happening, especially because I've definitely taken riskier walks alone.

Who would just go out of their way to cross the street and proceed to shove and shout at random busy people walking by, carrying boxes and equipment? Is it because we somehow offended you by *daring* to walk down Telegraph as the shortest route to our destination on campus?

I sympathize with those who are less fortunate than I am, but **victimhood doesn't give you the excuse to be an asshole**, and definitely not somehow justify violently lashing-out towards others.

How do you deal with someone who clearly is not reasonable and is actively threatening you? Do you try to talk them down? Do you stand up for your friends when they are shoved around? What do you do in those tense moments after you contact the UCPD? What do you do when all of these tactics don't work?

I'm just confused and honestly angry that I was powerless in resolving a situation that really shouldn't have happened at all. I feel disgusted by the fact that all I could do was stand by while he went off on ""you asians"" and how the police can't even touch him.

I'm going to go take a shower and wash his spit off my face.

I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,364,307,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it.

Thanks so much and ask away!

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/4AZaZ3M](https://imgur.com/a/4AZaZ3M)

**EDIT 4PM: We're live! Chancellor Christ will be answering questions until at least 5 PM.**

**EDIT 5:30PM: We've signed off but will be back at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. Thanks again for the questions!**

**EDIT 9/26 9:30AM: We're live again! Taking questions until 10:30 or so.**

Coulter event,51,36,"I can’t believe some of you condone and even support Refuse Fascism and ANTIFA’s actions while wanting lower tuition and cheaper housing for everyone. The more encouraged and welcomed they are, the more the University has to chalk up in security fees and reparations, and the University is using your money (and eventually raising costs) to pay for it. Regardless of whether you’re on the right or left, you should be conscious of this as a Cal student.

Peaceful protest is respectable, but these groups are incapable of that and their respective histories speak for themselves. I don’t care who’s coming to campus - if they’re coming to speak at a public institution they should be allowed to speak without such impediments. Sure, if a speaker has said reprehensible things, then educate people with reason. When you engage with violence and force then you automatically lose all respect amongst the rational, reasonable person whom you are trying to educate.

As Cal students, we should be actively speaking out against these types of groups and let them know that they are not welcome here, whether right or left wing, since we have to foot the bill in the end.",dzm1fl,berkeley

The craigslist ad has lists that the home is in Brittany Village.

4) parking spot so that I can park my car (I am an international student who has been attending a CC so I do not have anywhere to leave my car)

5) How studious do you think that the other people will be in my apartment? (I have previously lived with a group of gamers who had extremely clicky keyboards which prevented me from sleeping at night)

I also asked my other friends about a summer sublet. 

One of the sublets that I found was at the ground floor of Treehaven. It was a triple student house but the interior of the house was extremely old and had no air conditioning. It was right next to the entrance of the building and made me question all of the safety issues that I might have over the summer. (For the house at Treehaven, even though the unit is now occupied by 3 students I think I will be the only one living there over the summer...)

Overall, I am quite stressed and lost in terms of finding a house to stay in over the summer and in need of help.

Can you please respond to my questions related to Martinez Commons?

Thank you...

Cancel Residence Hall Contract for Spring?,9,4,"How difficult is it to get out of the Res Hall Contract for the Spring Semester? When I accepted the contract during my senior year of high school, the prospect of searching for off-campus housing seemed daunting. Now, paying \~$1500/month for a triple just seems way too expensive. Additionally, how would cancelling the contract affect my financial aid? For those of you living off-campus, do you receive financial aid for off-campus housing? And how is it distributed? By check, to a bank account?

Finally, if it is ridiculously difficult/not worth it to cancel my contract, when should I start looking for next Fall semester's housing? I've heard that I should start looking now, but I don't really see any options for next year yet.",e6tlm2,berkeley

Amazing living/housing opportunity!,33,24,"Hey everyone! 

I hope you all had a great break.

I am the Vice President of the Thorsen house here in Berkeley.
We live right next to the international house on Piedmont ave. 

We are currently looking for people to join the community and live in the house next fall.  This semester is time for us to get to know you and show you the wonderful and whimsical community that we have here.    

While we are technically a fraternity (Sigma Phi), we have a much different vibe and behavior as opposed to our neighbors *cough*DKE*cough*.  We are very inclusive and pride ourselves on maintaining a safe space for everyone that enters our home.   

We are in the middle of fighting for our right to go Co-ed, as the larger national board of our fraternity is opposed.  If you are interested in living here, please consider if you would join us in our fight to allow female identifying people formally join the society.  

Another thing to consider is that we do have a pledge process. Monday nights will be reserved for house meeting.  The pledge process is a completely drug and alcohol free experience that focuses on meditation and enlightenment and learning about the Thorsen house which is an architectural landmark.

If you are interested in attaining enlightenment while having kick ass parties along the way then come to our Friday night band party on the 25th, and Monday night dinner on the 28th- working on the Facebook page for our ""rush"" week activities.  

Here is a link to our house https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorsen_House

2) What are the chances of actually getting transferred to a housing option you want? (I imagine very small but don't want to risk making a wrong choice I'd later regret as ""I will not be able to reverse or change my request once the transfer has been granted"")

Tomorrow Austin City Council is scheduled to vote on something that will heavily effect the cost of student housing,165,22,"Many of you have heard about the Domain on Riverside plans. Developers want to destroy 5 apartment complexes in Riverside that are home to thousands of students and thousands of workers as well, and replace them with luxury condos, shopping, hotel room, etc. Tomorrow the City Council is scheduled to vote on whether the properties are rezoned to allow for this development. 

For many of us, West Campus is too expensive already so we have to live in Riverside where there is cheaper housing but still has public transit to school. The loss of this housing will push up the cost of housing in West Campus, and the people who already can't afford Riverside will lose some of the very few options for affordable student living. 

Yesterday UT Student Government voted to encourage Austin City Council to vote against this project. Although I support the idea that this project shouldn't happen, I don't see SG's last minute request to be in any way effective. Students themselves have already been fighting this project for over a year and are the reason this project has become such a public issue.

**If you want to protect low-income student housing, and the costs for West Campus housing, show up to City Hall tomorrow at 6:30pm and join the ongoing protests against these plans organized by students and workers that live in the area.**

I have historically been slow to make a friend group upon at arriving at a new school, and UT Austin has been no exception (I'm still just a freshman, I'll get there). Therefore, I currently lack a roommate(s). At the same time, my parents are being somewhat pushy about me getting roommates to lower the cost of housing. When I've gone on the Facebook groups for finding roommates, the vast majority of posters have been girls, which rules out that option for me.

Because of that, I haven't gone to a realtor/apartment locator yet, because I don't know what I'm looking for in terms of number of people. My current plan right now is to scam my parents over Thanksgiving into freeing me from the restraints they've given me in terms of finding roommates, but I don't know what the chances of success are on that.

1.) How to find roommates?

2.) Any recommended realtor/apartment locator?

ScholarHuts: Helping students find housing and roommates!,90,18,"Fellow Longhorn student here! Today we are launching the beta for [ScholarHuts](http://www.scholarhuts.com/), a website to help Longhorns find housing and roommates. (Not optimized for mobile yet!)

[www.scholarhuts.com](http://www.scholarhuts.com/)

Finding where to live and who to live with was always a shitty experience for us, so we built something to solve the problem.

Just answer a few questions, and get shown housing options one by one to either like or dislike. When you like a place, you can message other students who also liked the place, or students who already live there.

If you aren’t looking for roommates, you can still find exactly what you and your friends need. Whether it’s an apartment, condo, or house, it should be pretty easy to find.

Ratings from other students help guide you. (E.G, How noisy is this place compared to the average for UT Housing?)

Even if you aren’t using us, feel free to leave ratings for any place you have lived, whether you loved it or hated it! Help us fellow students know what places are good, and which ones are not! We just need your UT email, so no sleazy apartment owners can leave a fake rating! :)

Not all housing is on here yet, there WILL be some bugs, and we are still very much in product development mode, so feedback is SUPER helpful.

We won’t send you emails or anything, so don’t worry about that when using us!

That’s about it, happy hunting! Message me if you have any questions or feedback. My email is [andrewtateyoung@gmail.com](mailto:andrewtateyoung@gmail.com). Feedback can also be done through the website. Expect some changes in the product in the next few weeks, again we are super early, but just really want to solve this problem for all of you.

Prospective Freshman Housing Situation,2,8,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm sorry for adding yet another housing post, as I know there are many already.

How to navigate housing options?,3,4,"Hi y’all! I am an undergrad currently looking at one of UT’s graduate doctoral programs. I’ve followed this sub for a while now hoping that it would help me understand the housing options in Austin, but I’m honestly still pretty overwhelmed. I’m unfamiliar with the city and price points vs. safer/nicer areas. If I’m lucky enough to be accepted and choose UT, I’ll be moving down with a partner.

How do I begin to look at housing options? Does greater distance from campus necessarily mean more affordable rent, and is the distance worth it? Is public transport a thing here? Are most apartments pet-friendly if we choose to adopt? Thanks in advance for any and all advice 🙏",bwcfru,UTAustin

What's being done to resolve Waterloo's student housing crises,284,56,"Today council had several students come to give testimonials about their personal experiences about the housing crises being experienced throughout Waterloo. Up until today I wasn't aware of the gravity of the situation, and have been convinced that immediate actions need to be taken. Even if you aren't one of the students still homeless, you're almost certainly affected by largely affordable prices.

***What's being done by WUSA***:

* Established a **committee on Student Housing in Kitchener-Waterloo**. Membership will have both interested and affected students, so please **reach out to** [**vped@wusa.ca**](mailto:vped@wusa.ca) **and indicate your interest** if you'd like. Details on how this will work to be finalized by October 6th.
* In addition to a long term solution, that committee will investigate funding and implementing **emergency student housing**, to help insure no student is left homeless.
* WUSA Execs are preparing a **report on student housing** in KW by November 3rd. Among other recommendations, it will include advise on the **possibility of a class action lawsuit** against certain housing companies on behalf of students. (We will have to consult lawyers to find out if this is even possible)
* (informally) We discussed the possibility of maintaining a **blacklist of companies** which we will refuse to conduct business with until predatory/harmful practices end.

I'll try answer any questions here, but if you want a faster and more private response my email is [johnp@hunte.me](mailto:johnp@hunte.me).

Does anyone know of reputable sites or companies that do 4 month leases in Sunnyvale?

Housing Issue: subleasing for more than lease is ILLEGAL,22,55,"Serious issue: charging a subtenant more money than your lease is ILLEGAL. It is exploitative and puts some of us in a seriously difficult financial situation. People are charging about $100/mo higher for Fall subleases than they pay for the lease. At places like ICON, the extra payment can be as high as $200/mo.

What can you do to help? Don't let them get away with it. Call out anyone you see doing this on Facebook, Kijiji, real life, etc. They will most likely apologize and realize they can't exploit so easily. Report it if necessary, especially if you are a victim. One person reporting is all it takes.

TLDR: Call out people for illegally charging more for sublets than they pay for their lease!

EDIT: To everyone assuming I'm salty because I'm looking for a sublet -- no, I already hold a multi-year lease. It just pains me to see friends get denied because they are not willing to illegally pay additional money. Even if they can afford it, they do not want to take a legal chance.",ch1itn,uwaterloo

Student Housing,5,10,"Okay, so I'm not 100% sure if this post is allowed, so delete it if it's not. Also, yes, I've read through the Off Campus Housing section of the wiki.

So first of all, the student housing groups for Waterloo on Facebook are so wack it's insane. I had one guy literally ask for $800/mo to live in his living room with a divider and it was literally sold the next day???? Also there's so many listings that aren't even viable for a UW or WLU student like people renting out their houses that are a 40 minute bus ride away for $800+/mo

Also, what's with people posting places and not posting recent pictures, I've literally seen dozens of listings with pictures from before the 2010's. One dude had a picture dated Christmas 2000 up on there, I wasn't even born yet and i'm supposed to sign a 12 month lease on a place like that?

And who's actually signing leases for these places that aren't even built/open yet? Who's out here being told: ""The place opens September 4th, so you can't see it, only blueprints and stock images."" and thinking ""Hmm, sounds perfect, let me just sign this 12 month contract for a place that isn't there yet!"" I can't be the only one thinking that's the most low IQ thing I can think of.

Anyways, this entire post is just me lowkey saying someone with an actual brain, please sublet to me or rent out a room to me, thanks. :)",cvbcmc,uwaterloo

Taxes on housing stipend / corporate housing during summer internship in the US,2,1,"Hey, I'm backfiling my US and Canadian taxes from the last two tax years (2017 and 2018).

I worked in the US in summer 2017 and got a housing stipend of USD 6000 for the internship. The stipend was included in my wages on my W2.

I have filled out the forms for my US taxes already, but I have some questions about my Canadian return.

I found a post from last year where (from my understanding) u/yerich managed to exclude housing stipend/corporate housing from the foreign income tax line, while still getting a foreign tax credit for the taxes paid on the housing stipend/corporate housing to the IRS.

Has anyone else done the same thing? I'm having trouble understanding the process and was looking for advice.

Why do we always reccommend on-campus housing to first year students?,0,16,"I am in third year and if there is one thing I would tell my first-year self, it would be to live off-campus rather than on residence 

Off-campus housing can:

* Save money  (residence was dumb expensive for the bare minimum amenities tbh)
* Teach first-years how to cook and grocery shop in a cost-effective manner (cause meal plan was expensive and bland as hell)
* Can learn how to take the bus and utilize off-campus resources (I barely used the bus when I was in first year)
* Help develop a sense of responsibility/independence rather than having to abide by UW's rules (On-campus residence rules felt a bit restrictive cause too many things are a liability issue nowadays).
* You could probably decrease the number of times you have to evacuate your place by 50% because of false fire alarms.
* Escape the gloomy and somewhat depressive UW atmosphere  (especially during exam times)

The only things I see going for on-campus housing is:

* Meeting people in your program and making friends, in general, could be easier (however, this could easily be done if you live off-campus and are a social person or met people from the UW first-year facebook pages)
* Being in close vicinity to campus (unless you live in REV or something lol)
* You are bound to an 8-month lease which is especially good if you are a CS/Eng student and have a 1B co-op. (But, you can also find 8-month leases on UW housing FB pages)

What about you? Are you happy you lived on-campus for your first year?  What was your experience like?

Female Only Housing Legal in Ontario??,0,31,"So, as all of us know, the struggle of finding a new house for the Fall season and all that. I have noticed that alot of the housing that gets posted in facebook groups like ""Student Housing Waterloo"" and Off-Campus Housing and all that have ads saying ""Female only"" and these houses are usually in good locations and have good pricing. Feels alot like discrimination against gender to me. Are landlords allowed to do this?? I have been seeing it done for 4 years now and I am sure it has been done in the past. Most of my research says that it is not allowed so why are so many people doing it...am I missing something?

NEED ADVICE - spotted cockroach at my sublet/house,2,7,"Currently subletting with a family in a house for coop and safe to say it's been the worst four months of my life. I've been having the worst living experience here. Everyone other than me here is an international student and expect to be cleaned up after. The power has gone out once. The water heating wasn't working one time. The shower drain got clogged bc the stupid girl never empties it everytime she uses it despite me telling her to. I feel like I'm the only one who takes the initiative to clean up and everyone is just one with the filth. There's hairs always on the bathroom floor. The kitchen I shake with, the student never does his dishes frequently enough, leaves the drain filled with food straps, and leaves cooked food out over night. 

I sucked it up for the past 3 months but now I'm done. I swear to god when I was in the kitchen this morning, I saw a cockroach crawling on the floor. I swear. So now I don't known what to-do. The kitchen is two floors below my bedroom but still. I go home every weekend now, and even work from home on Fridays to avoid the place.  Theres five weeks left of the coop and I'm not sure what I should do now. The exterminator fee would be costly, and it's costly to move and find a new sunlet for the next five weeks.

What to do for Fall only housing as an exchange student?,5,15,"I will be coming to the University of Waterloo on exchange from Australia in Fall (Math/CompSci). Unfortunately, I have discovered that this is the worst term to find housing in, especially since I started so late.

I initially applied for CLV, the only accommodation available to exchange students in Fall. Soon after, I got an email to say it was full. Then I applied to the colleges, for which I am now on a wait list. I have emailed every listing that says it's available for Fall on the off-campus housing site, and contacted plenty of people in the facebook groups but I always get the same answers - they are either full, or they don't offer Fall-only accommodation.

Coop housing Scam,1,6,"Hello, I just found a place for my coop and went about with the regular things. I have signed the lease and now the landlord is asking for first and last month rent deposit.

The thing is that this coop is a 9 hour drive from waterloo, so it's not feasible meeting in person to pay him. Is it safe for me to send him an  e-transfer.
If the lease turns out to be a scam, will I be able to get my money back if I sent him money through e-transfer? Sorry if I'm being paranoid, but I feel like I don't know the guy and just sending money to a random person.

The other post with nasty room mates and the cats made me consider writing this post. I’m in my 5th year and I used to commute into Waterloo as I struggled finding sublets each term. I had some success last year but with mixed results. This semester no matter what I do I have nothing. I message people on 2 of the UW sublet pages and get no replies, Kijiji ain’t helping and when I do find a place it’s nasty AF or it’s female only and I’m told “read the ad. Female only”. Is it always this hard for a guy to find a tidy place with parking to call home for 4 months? Maybe I’m doing something wrong.

Too depressed and unmotivated to study,25,11,"As the title suggests, my depression has gotten even worse over the course of a few weeks, and it’s nearly reached a breaking point during finals. I’m going through a lot of brain fog, insomnia and anxiety, and it has thus been quite emotionally taxing for me. 

A lot has happened in this semester that my tolerance for stress has chipped away (housing, family issues, lack of emotional support/friends, financial stress, dropping out of one course, relapsing eating disorder, etc.). 

I have 3 finals to study for (I already did one on Tuesday; 2/3 that I currently need to study for are memory intensive, while the other one is stats and I’m not very good at math), and an essay due in 2 days that was assigned on Sunday, even though it was supposed to be assigned 2 weeks ago. 

I love my major, however, I currently only like one course out of all of my other courses, which makes it very difficult to feel motivated about studying for them. Having an essay to write in the midst of studying for finals does not help either. 

How do you guys push through slumps like these? Is there any advice for a freshman like me?

* Anonymous Golden Hawk

Each review signs off with a name (except for the Golden Hawk review) that doesn't match the fake account name.

* e.g. The review that's under Adrian Blackwell is signed off with ""Shariq""

The reviews are only positive and praise ""Lauren"", probably to make up for all the negative reviews saying she is rude. They probably got a student worker to write some five star reviews for them, who apparently wasn't very creative with the names. Even after all this, they still have a [2.6 star rating with 80 reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=bridgeport+house+rez+one&oq=bridgeport+house+rez+one#lrd=0x882bf3f38aae79f7:0x5033ad9c792c3be6,1,,,).

Massive Data Leak of Accommod8u Maintenance Requests Over the Last Two Years,735,74,"Accommod8u, KW4Rent, and their parent company Prica Global Enterprises (a local business) have long been known in the KW community for their poor service and shady practices. Due to a glaring security flaw in the Accommod8u tenant portal, it was possible to access every maintenance request since December 2017. A close look at the 6000+ entries reveals an egregious disregard for the rights and wellbeing of the residents.

Housing driscrimination sucks,1,52,"EDIT: Thanks for the eye-opening comments people. I understand now that some females genuinely feel unsafe in their own house/appartment when living with males. It is very disheartening to learn that such a fear is still prevalent, and although I cannot do anything about the people I don't know, I will try to be more aware of that if I rent a place that is co-ed in the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Come on I thought the whole point of today was ""equal opportunity"". I'm currently looking for a place to sublet for coop and so many ads request ""female only"".  Happened in previous terms too, I messaged people once just in case and got a place like that but its so frustrating. The opposite (males only) is SO rare, heck even then it says stuff like ""male preffered"" or they specify that its a group of males in the house already.

&#x200B;

ffs I swear half of the ads are ""female only"" + they seem to always be the best price (I imagine cutting half your clientele does that).

&#x200B;

And please please don't come at me saying stuff like ""finally guys learn what it feels like"". Society is supposed to evolve not regress. Why would you wish discrimination to happen to anybody  ?

&#x200B;

Btw could I potentially email people without specifying my gender and get the places like that ? I understand that people can be as discriminatory as they want but once a lease is signed or im in the place, can they do anything about it ?",b173sa,uwaterloo

Sept 30 4:22AM Fergus house hit and run on parking lot,21,3,"while my car was parked at fergus house parking lot on early sept 30th morning, my rear door on driver side has been damaged by someone who parked right next to my vehicle. 

Unfortunately the person who did it, decided to just walk away from it, not leaving any contact information.

Whoever did this, I want to let them know that I have a clear video shot of the suspect's face from my dashcam and also the color and vehicle type of it as well. (It was a white dodge caravan parked at the spot 68 facing lester st). It happened around 4:22 AM and person clearly was aware of what he / she has done, and it is very sad that they just thought walking away from damaging someone else's property is going to be okay and will never be caught.

The incident has been filed as vandalism to Waterloo Regional Police today and they will start investigation very soon. Fergus house management has been reached for the access on their surveillance camera facing the parking lot. The reason that I am posting this incident on here is that I still want the person to be responsible for what he / she has done before things get a lot worse. 

Please contact me if you think you are responsible for this incident. I am more than happy to resolve this issue without causing anymore headaches.",dbn7gy,uwaterloo

Housing Suggestions Please !,9,12,"Howdy Aggies,
Reviews can be notoriously contradictory, with some praising a particular accommodation and some absolutely thrashing it to smithereens. What some people praise at LoftSmart, others absolutely slander ok google reviews. So really counting on the reddit community for some sound suggestions.

I'll be joining the Mays business School (Wehner Building) this fall and am looking for an apartment. I'm an international student and would like to stay someplace which is near to the school (or atleast is well connected to the Mays by bus). 
I had some suggestions recommending Z Islander but have recently come across a lot of bad reviews on reddit. Other apartments which I found out after my rudimentary research ok loftsmart and other sites were 
1) - The Gateway - it's 4x4 is pretty cheap
2) - The Tradition -
3) - The London - 
4) - The Enclave - Near all the utilities ( always a +point)

Having no relative or friend who's in College Station right now, I'd count on all you samaritans to help me out here. Do let me know of any more suggestions you have or any critique(pros and cons) of the handful of apartments I've written above

Graduate Student Housing Recommendations in 2019,9,5,"Hey r/aggies,

While there are some older posts on graduate student housing recommendations in College Station/Bryan, I thought to start a new thread for incoming graduate students at TAMU for 2019, such as myself, to use as a resource while looking for housing options.

Many recommendations I have come by suggest condominiums and other dense student housing complexes. I was hoping to get recommendations on more residential neighborhoods that are less likely to be occupied by undergraduate students, but rather young professionals that may be a quieter part of the city. I am more accustomed to living among young families and graduate students in apartment duplexes and am hoping to find a neighborhood like that in College Station/Bryan.

If you are currently a young professional/graduate student living in the College Station/Bryan, please feel free to DM on insights you have about your current living situation.

Housing option Whitecreek vs ramp style,3,17,"If I could get some perspective on this from people who have lived at these places I'd appreciate it.
My goal is to have a room by myself no matter where I stay. 
As of right now my main options are staying at Whitecreek or a single dorm at Hart or Walton hall.
The pros and cons to me are 
Whitecreek 
·pros
- private room and bathroom.
- having a kitchen so I have the option to cook full meals
- overall fits more of my plans for setting up my dorm.
·cons
- commute, which is a big one for me
- about 1000 more dollars

Ramp style
· pros
- right on campus which is a big plus
- lower cost
- slightly more space
· cons 
- less ideal for how I envision my dorm being set up
- no kitchen 
- heard rumors of Walton being shit in different ways

Aggie Ring Story From Facebook,19,4,"So I'm at C Hunts Ice House in Austin playing 42 and watching the Texans defeat the evil Patriots and a fella comes in named Tom

And he sees my Aggie Ring and he says his dad was a veterinarian who graduated from A&M and he lived in College Station for 13 years himself but majored in beer and women so he never got a ring and ended up working the oil fields

So he tells this story of one time his dad was called in because a heifer had an extruded uterus and that is a sloppy job pushing that whole kit and kaboodle back in then sewing it up

So he is driving away and his Aggie Ring isn't on his hand and he is like ""shiatsu massage"" because he knows where the ring is but figures he'll never be seeing it again

So he calls up the ring office and orders another one telling them he lost it

So they prepare to send him a replacement

In the meantime one of his African American farm hands was at the barber shop in Elgin and he sees another fella wearing an Aggie Ring and he says ""you didn't go to no Texas A&M lemme see that"" and it says the docs name on the inside so he asks how he came to possess it

So he says he works at the slaughterhouse and he is splitting this heifer and darned if this ring didn't fly out and ding ding ding on floor headed for the blood drain and he catches it like he is gollum going for the precious

Turns out the farmer knew the heifer would never calf again after that and he would not sell her to another farmer knowing that so he sent her to be slaughtered to recover some money since her breeding days were over

So he offers the guy $50 bucks for it telling him he knows the doc and he lost it and the guy agrees and sells him the ring and he goes and gifts it back to the doc and so now Tom has both of his father's rings

It's been awhile since I've been back to A&M - class of '15! 

A group of aggies and I are going back to visit this weekend, and we want to tailgate (set up our own small one) for the game if possible. When I went there, I always just attended social org's tailgates, so I'm not sure how it works. Is it possible to just show up (not camp out or pay for a spot) and set up a small tailgate area? Would this be a huge pain in the ass? I was thinking of setting up somewhere around the VP's house and pretty far back behind the student side if there is any space back there.

To top it off, they are still trying to charge me and the current tenants for issues that took place during the previous lease with the previous tenants.

Do yourselves a favor and lease from anyone else, just stay away from Real Estate BCS.

I have three roommates. 1 roommate now has a giant German Sheppard dog in the apt.

I requested to live in an apt that pet-free. This one roommate has a dog in the apt since Oct 17. The other roommates were not consulted before she moved the dog in. After she moved the dog in she told us the dog would only be in the apart for 1 week. That time period has come and gone.

I have complained to the Mgmt office about the dog and asked that the dog be removed. My parents have complained to mgmt. The other roommates have complained. Really no actionable feedback from the mgmt office.

In the meantime, the apartment stinks to high heaven. There is dog hair on the floor. The smell is starting is seep into bedrooms. 

What is my recourse in this situation? My lease ends in July. I would NEVER stop paying rent, but how do I get the property mangers to do something about the dog.

To make matters worse the roommate has become belligerent towards anyone that says anything to her about the dog. This same roommate leaves full plates of food in the kitxhen sink...for days at a time.

Is it possible to inform someone at TAMU about the non-action of the mgmt team. What can I do to get mgmt to take action ablhlg thegoingbto take

Shady MLM Southwestern Advantage [read everything],157,43,"The company is called Southwestern Advantage and apparently it's not a new thing on the TAMU campus. it has a long and often not so charming history behind it. 

They usually post many flyers in classes like CHEM 107 or POLS 206/7 claiming it's a paid internship.

They say that it's a 100% commission based, zero salary internship that requires you to work 80+ hours a week going door to door and selling textbooks. Sounds good right? 

- all the positive reviews online are from bot accounts or sales managers of Southwestern. You have to go to the last pages of any review site to find 1 star reviews, and those reviews are heavily downvoted. I wonder why.

- people are being charged $19.95 a month for hidden services they didn't pay for

- ""interns"" - or slave workers - are told to work 12 hour shifts per day going door to door, often trespassing late at night or disturbing people in the morning

- All travel, gas, food, housing expenses are paid by YOU. They pay for sample items and training for one week, and you're left alone for 3 months selling their products.

- they show off their top workers, claiming they earn between 8,000 to 22,000 a month. But this is in the top 5% of all workers. A majority don't earn anywhere close to the minimum amount. 

- Worker exploitation - they target low income college students and foreign workers who need visas with misleading advertisements, and once foreign students come here to work, they are left on their own with zero management.

- workers are reportedly required to target poorer income neighboorhoods where the families are pressured into helping their children succeed in school and will be desperate to buy the books

- commission is 40% (approximate). that might seem high but then you realized you're trying to convince poor people to shell out over $150 for one textbook from a total stranger.

- they claim that their textbook is the #1 worldwide. They claim it covers all the topics including history, math, science, English, etc, for only $150. upon further inspection - there's 6 total books. the one advertised is only a sample textbook. So it would cost over $800 for all resources.

- it's reported that buyers are charged hidden fees when they purchase a textbook, for a website they don't use. When complaints are filed, they dismiss it, and claim they signed a contract to purchase it, which they didn't.

- There are no safeguards to prevent people from failing and losing all their money. if you don't sell their textbooks, you're done. As in you will end up going home with pennies in your wallet, if you can even make it home.

- They use famous politicians and celebrities to relate to people. Apparently it's true that they did work for this company but have never personally mentioned it nor endorse it. Another shady trick.

- they are banned from major universities across the United States for deception and fraud.

- you will be an independent contractor. that means they aren't responsible for your safety, healthcare, insurance, etc. Anything you do is on you, even if it's not your fault. I read older stories of their ""interns"" being mugged and they completely ignore it. While some might say 'you should know that', the company doesn't actually inform you of this or might briefly mention it in one sentence in an otherwise long, drawn out contract that you probably won't read fully and sign aimlessly.

oh, in the informational, they want you to list 10 names and phone numbers of friends who you think ""might be reliable people"". They're just using those phone numbers to draw in and brainwash more poor students.

#in conclusion

I literally learned all this because I did 30 minutes of online research. I can't imagine what we'd find out if a higher authority investigated this for years.

#please don't fall for these obviously scummy people. they deceive poor students to sell their nearly worthless books to poor families.

You're literally better off working an $8/hr job at HEB or something where you're close to home, have real connections, and can't go bankrupt trying to shill worthless textbooks.

#if you can't tell if someone is being genuine or not, or if a company you're interested is NOT trying to scam you, then you should definitely step back and help others avoid it.

I don't fucking understand how the CAREER CENTER ON CAMPUS continues to help promote and support this obviously fake and misleading company. 

Like I have no doubt the luckiest and best workers can earn that much. But their entire organization is based on scamming and stealing gullible people's money and that's how they're able to pay the top 1% of workers what they advertise. Everyone else stays poor.

Good afternoon r/gatech community! 

The Residence Hall Association is committed to making your home here at Georgia Tech as comfortable and convenient as possible for you. Our first step in working towards that goal began with collecting ideas for residential initiatives. The most requested initiative quickly became clear: working on improvements to the Housing Maintenance Request System. The first step towards this is collecting information regarding your experiences as a resident with the Housing Maintenance Request System.

We're planning on sending out more information later this week via email regarding Residential Advocacy; however, due to the maintenance issues we've seen reported online over the past week, we decided to go ahead and send out the following form to our friends in the Reddit community. Please see below for more information:

**\[RHA Res Adv #1\] Housing Maintenance Request System Feedback Form:** [**https://forms.gle/J4RcoVQxVnc126YM7**](https://forms.gle/J4RcoVQxVnc126YM7)

RHA is collecting information on the current systemic issues with the Housing Maintenance Request System. In the form linked above, you'll find general questions regarding the maintenance system, space to provide general feedback, and even a section dedicated to explaining specific situations that you've encountered with the maintenance system.

DISCLAIMER: Due to the amount of responses we're anticipating, we will not be able to respond to individual submissions. This form is being used to collect data to support updates to the Housing Maintenance Request System, and we cannot personally fix any ongoing issues with your rooms; however, if you are experiencing issues currently, please contact: [facilities@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:facilities@housing.gatech.edu).

Really Peeved About Housing,126,59,"Sorry for another rant, I just find it really infuriating that I'm paying 2.5k for housing over the summer and the goddamn air conditioner hasn't been working properly for the past week. The thing that prevented us from initially moving in when we were supposed to has (unsurprisingly) become a problem again. Funny enough, apparently it's only the rooms that are suffering from this problem because the hallways have been air conditioned just fine.

Like, it's hot and humid during the summer. If this was going to be a problem, why stick us in here knowing this could potentially happen again and might take weeks to fix? Coming back every day to an extremely hot and humid room really isn't ideal for sleeping and studying since I end up becoming a soaked mess within a fairly short period of time.

A bit peeved about housing,30,10,"So I was supposed to move into Woodruff South today, but they're doing maintenance on the AC. I appreciate them moving us somewhere with AC (Nelson Shell) , but what I didn't appreciate was the attitude I got when I asked if it was possible if I could get the key to the room I'm going to move into in a week anyway so that I could move most of my belongings there since I would only have the help of my one friend for today only since he is going back home (we're OOS). The rest of my friends are back at home, I have no family down here, and I wasn't technically supposed to be moving my stuff anyway since I just got diagnosed with mono, so now I'm just in this pickle where I'm too small and weak to carry my stuff over and up to the third floor of another dorm next week all because they couldn't let me just take the damn key, have my friend and I move what I didn't need for the week into the room, and hell, even return the key and pick it up the following week if it was that big of a problem and I would just live with what I needed in Nelson Shell this week. I was technically supposed to get the room today anyway. Now I can't unpack anything or really get comfortable since I'll just have to up and move again anyway.

Phd student housing options?,2,8,"Hey guys, looking for some advice here. I got accepted into GT off the waitlist for their PhD program, but didnt get a package email which covered housing info till after the deadline to apply for graduate housing. For my first year I was hoping to do grad housing on campus and then for the remaining years, maybe buy a condo or apartment somewhere biking/driving distance of campus. 

Since I applied for grad housing after the deadline, I'm currently on the waitlist for housing and have moved up to position 4 on the waitlist. I've been looking at places in home park and midtown, and was going to get a house for 645/m including utilities for a 4 bed 2 bath in Home park, but that fell through as they filled up fast. I'm looking in the midtown and home park areas, but am currently leaning more toward home park for affordability and the fact that more grad students live there than in midtown.

Now I've been messaging people left, right, and center and found a place that's a 5 minute walk from the physics building, but I heard the landlord isnt that great, plus hes charging about 1050/m per person if you include utilities for a 2 bed 2 bath. I'm still willing to get the place for the convenience of it, but the price seems high considering it's in home park and isnt gated (even though it's right on the edge of campus and on a main street so pretty safe). I also cant seem to find anyone who is willing to pay that price for the rent, and the landlord isnt budging.

Should I bite the bullet and pay for half this apartment and hope he doesn't charge me the full amount if he doesnt manage to find another person for the 2nd room, or should I look farther away from campus where there are a lot more available apartments for cheaper?",byy5s3,gatech

Find the new Under the Couch and I'll give you money,72,61,"PAYMENT FOR ALL GOOD INFO

Hello! It's me, your friendly university Musician's Network president (until spring semester at least)!

Under the Couch is a student run arts space and music venue. It is the home of Musician's Network and its shows, and MN helps put on shows and events for many other organizations and departments within the space. During the daytime it serves as a relaxing public lounge with music and ~atmosphere~. There are also practice spaces and a studio. 

I don't know how many of you remember or were previously informed, but Under the Couch will be going down with the upcoming Student Center demolition in May 2020, and there are no plans for a new one to be built when the new Campus Center is constructed. Only the Musician's Network practice spaces and studio will remain. 

This, however, does not have to be the end of student-run arts space on campus.

After a meeting with VP of Campus Services Kasey Helton,  Senior Director of the Student Center Lindsay Bryant, and Undergraduate Student Body President Pooja Juvekar, Musician's Network is now looking for alternative locations around campus to serve as a location for a new Under the Couch.

There are a few wants/needs that would make a location suitable:

* Ability to accommodate 50+ persons at capacity
* Ability to install a sound system (big speakers/equipment and sound booth)
* Ability to be loud and play amplified music
* Space to install a stage and lighting
* Space to store equipment
* Easy access for patrons and load-in
* Bathroom Access
* Space to function as a daytime lounge
* Visibility 

Not all of these necessarily need to be met, but the more the better


We have a few ideas so far. Some are just shots in the dark/completely off the wall, and that's fine. We're brainstorming now and we'll look into further feasibility in the future.

* Living Learning Communities room near the wing zone
* Woody's Food Court
* Second Floor of Barnes and Noble
* Wreck Techs space on East Campus
* Brittain Rec
* Rent a storefront in Tech Square 
* Somewhere in the library?? (lol noise) 
* Somewhere near the football stadium?? 
* Somewhere around the biotech quad?? (I only know of the restaurant area) 
* Somewhere at the Bill Moore Student Success Center??
* Biltmore Building Basement?? 
* Dalney Parking Deck somehow
* NAV West, North (/u/illusions18) 
* Wacky off campus ideas: church west of CRC,  church north of 10th, Annex bookstore
* Other things we talked about in the meeting but I forgot to mention (sorry): CODA, Kandeda building, freshman connector, west village, Scheller Tower, SAA house
* Paper Building?? 
*Aware Home (/u/ILoveSilverForks) 

(If you or your organization currently occupy any of these spaces, I do not mean to step on any toes with these suggestions) 
So not all of these are overseen by Campus Services. The easiest solution would likely be under them but starting a conversation with a different department could also be possible.


ANYHOW

If you have any good ideas about underused spaces on campus that could suit our needs, I want to hear them!! I'll venmo $5 for every good, unique suggestion (this is my offer personally, not the club or any other gt organization). $2.50 for further info of possible spaces on the ""??"" ones.

I've been sick for the past month and a half and have been struggling in classes because of it. At such a prestigious school, where I work two jobs and am a full time student (so I have absolutely no time to be sick), you'd think Tech would put a little more emphasis on taking care of our health so we can perform well. But alas, their solution is what? Change the name from ""mildew"" to ""environmental growth"" and sweep the problem under the rug yet again.

I'm tired of housing treating their employees poorly.

College Republicans President just resigned over the impeachment inquiry,214,100,"Got this email, basically says the national GOP sucks now and should buck Trump

Hello friends.

A week ago, the House of Representatives voted to formalize the process of impeaching the President. I was disappointed to see that not a single Republican voted in favor. While the Democrats’ approach to this process has been far from perfect, it has become abundantly clear that our President has unlawfully abused the trust placed in him via the office that he holds. His actions with respect to the ongoing scandal regarding his communications with the President of Ukraine are without explanation or excuse. An ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that our President has broken the law, and if someone claims to uphold the constitution, then the appropriate response is clear: these actions must be investigated, and the President must be held responsible.

I have always considered myself a Republican. My views on policy and governing principles have not changed during the course of this administration, even while the national party has contorted itself and abandoned some of its longest-standing principles to placate its current leader in the White House. In fact, these principles – respect for our constitution, rule of law, and the belief that the President should be held to the highest ethical standards – are what led me to conclude that I must separate myself from the GOP and support the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It brings me no joy to break with a party that, for years, I have seen as holding the best solutions to so many political questions. It is clear, however, that the present-day national Republican Party, with few exceptions, cares more about defending the indefensible in an attempt to cling to their own power than pursuing truth and justice. This party has lost sight of the values that made it unique and has fallen into the trap of chasing the whims of one man who constantly lies, brings shame to our country, and defies our constitution. This is the same man who, when speaking of John McCain, said he prefers those who ""weren't captured"" despite his several deferments from duty. While Senator McCain sat in a Vietcong prison cell, the President described avoiding contracting STDs as ""his own personal Vietnam."" The President’s term will come to an end – his leadership is temporary. However, the stains he has placed on the party he represents and the conservative movement will be recorded forever in history. I sincerely hope that the mantle of Republican leadership one day returns to those who value honor, dignity, and conservative principles, but those currently at the helm of the Party seem to be charting a course towards a much darker future for the GOP.

Many people who share my views have stayed silent, hoping that soon enough the embarrassment of the current administration will blow over and we can pretend this presidency never happened. That is simply not possible – it is increasingly clear that continued silence is tantamount to complicity. Those of us who cannot abide by this President’s actions must make clear where we stand. The reluctance of the party to separate itself from its leader, or even to criticize him on his worst mistakes, shows that change from the inside is not currently possible. As such, I will be stepping down as Chairman of the College Republicans at Georgia Tech, effective immediately. If there is no tolerance for dissent and no appetite for following the law in the national GOP, I must respectfully part ways. I believe there is much good to be recovered from this political organization, but that is all it is – a political organization. It does not, and should not, dominate our lives. I, for one cannot support the actions of the current leaders of the party, and so I will be, for the time being, separating myself from their leadership.

The last two years we shared as a chapter were extraordinary in so many ways - no doubt in large part because of the many incredible people I’ve had the privilege of meeting through this organization. We more than doubled our membership and hosted many great leaders whom I still respect, including then-Secretary Brian Kemp. It is regrettable that my service must end in this way, but I simply could not allow the current leadership of the national party to speak for me anymore. I hope that in my time leading our chapter I have represented our shared principles and Georgia Tech well.

All the best and Go Jackets,

Home Park or Harris?,1,3,"Hey everyone,

I'm a first year currently in freshman housing. I was wondering everyone's thoughts and experiences  living off campus, likely in home park, or in Harris. Next year, I'm thinking that NAV/on campus apartments and most of the other typical apartments near Tech would be too much.

Here are the main questions I have:

* Do not plan on buying any meal plan next year, so will likely need to cook in some in kitchen
   * Can you even do this in Harris? And if so, how inconvenient is it?
* How much can I realistically expect to spend on a room in Home Park?
   * I was estimating $600-700 including utilities. Is this realistic?
   * Could I potentially sublease during the summer if I intern elsewhere for 80% or so, or is that too optimistic?
* How do the communities compare?
   * Is there any community in either, or is it pretty much just a place to stay?",dz8al8,gatech
Housing Options for Upperclassmen,12,8,"I’m a 4th year wondering what housing options are for upperclassmen at Tech. I currently live in Home Park, but I was hoping to move out next year since I’m not really loving my rooming situation. I have absolutely nothing in common with my housemates, who have all graduated from school, and there are also around 10 girls living in the house. So a lot of the time, it’s just way too loud. I would just prefer to live with people who I have more things in common with. 

Normally, I would find friends to live with, but I transferred this year and honestly haven’t made any friends so far. Since I don’t know anyone to move in with, I’ve been wondering if I should just find an apartment on campus. I’ve heard mixed things about the apartments though and have been hesitant to apply for housing. I know the deadline is coming up soon, though. Are there apartments on campus that typically house upperclassmen?

If it’s better to look off campus, are there sites that people typically use to find roommates? If anyone has any experience with using these sites, please let me know if they went well for you.",aoy1f9,gatech
GT further hurts grad students with increases to student fees and mandatory health insurance costs,289,57,"Georgia Tech has been steadily increasing student fees, originally created at $100/semester as a ""temporary measure"" in 2009 and have steadily risen to 10x that for the current fiscal year ($1,000/semester). Most graduate students are required to enroll full time spring, summer, and fall totaling student fees of ~$2700/yr. This is the fifth highest among all graduate schools in the country. That is ~9-18% of a grad student's income, depending on which department the grad students is in. Because these fees are not bundled into tuition waivers, they are still taxed for those fees even though they never actually see that money in their income. Additionally, the new student health insurance provider will increase our mandatory insurance costs by $1500/yr. On top of all of this, GT won't let other outside grants or funding cover student fees. Graduate students play a critical role in university systems. If you factor in cost of rent in Atlanta, food, utilities, and other mandatory expenses, it can become quite clear that the increase in student fees can be the make or break point for a grad student going into debt or not. Graduate students teach and grade courses, provide cheap research labor, and help to drive ingenuity (and therefore funding and prestige) for Georgia Tech. If GT doesn't do anything to fix this, by paying their grad students a competitive wage WITHOUT duplicitous fees, they will lose fantastic students to other universities. Cost is something every grad student looks at when comparing top tier grad schools. If they feel they'll go into (or further into) debt (after undergrad), they will choose to go elsewhere. This affects all of levels of GT: it affects GTA teaching quality, it affects institute research quality, and it affects grad student quality of life. And don't even get me started on how the on-campus, university-promoted, graduate student living center ISN'T EVEN AFFORDABLE ON GRAD STUDENT STIPENDS. I tried to avoid getting rant-y, but GT seems to genuinely be out of touch with their grad students and it's illegal for us to unionize, so I'll end here.",cmhrpo,gatech

[Housing] Beware the Slumlords,73,23,"My friends and I signed a lease with Northsteppe for the 2019-20 year around the beginning of the past fall semester. About a week ago, I called to see parking space availabilities at the place I was supposed to move into and the guy at the other end says ""actually... we don't own that property anymore."" Of course, I freaked out about potentially losing the lease and asked about the new landlord, when the property was sold, rates, etc. The guy only said ""Any other questions must go to the new landlord"" while NOT TELLING ME WHO THIS NEW LANDLORDS WERE. He kept promising an email would be sent when none came, and when asked for contact information of management or even the realtor who sold the place, he said he ""\[didn't\] have that information."" 

Today, I walked into their office with two of my future roommates and there was a guy I hadn't seen before, probably the realtor responsible. He basically told us everything we needed to know, including when the property ownership had changed. Apparently it was sold ""about two months ago."" They didn't let us know about this for close to TWO MONTHS and we only found out when I asked about parking.  


TL; DR: Northsteppe sold the apartment I was supposed to be moving into and didn't let any of the tenants know. Tenants find out coincidentally when asking about parking. Northsteppe refuses to provide any additional information about the new landlord until after a week of the tenants pestering their office with phone calls and visits.",c8ht6o,osu

"Housing Available ($315/month rent, 10 min. walk to 18th Ave Library, North side of off campus)",12,11,"Hello everyone,

I have a room available in my 4 person house for next school year.

Here are the **benefits** of living with us:

- **Affordable** rent: **Our rent is $315/month**. People are often shocked when I tell them how much my rent is (it's actually $300/month this year, but our landlords are raising it, $315 is still of course cheap as heck)

- **Very** close to campus: This house is about a 7 minute walk to the North Rec and a 10 minute walk to 18th avenue library (I know this because I work at 18th ave, and I often leave 10 minutes before I have to be at work)

- North side of off campus: In my opinion, the north side of off campus is better to live on. If you look at the crime reports that have happened this school year, the overwhelming majority happened on the south side.

Roommate issues...should I go through with room transfer or live off-campus?,22,21,"Hey everyone. I’m a freshman OOS Morrill Scholar currently living in LT (I’m honors.) I am having some problems with one of my roommates in my quad and I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I am bisexual and my roommate is very Christian. She was kind of ambivalent about my sexuality at first, claiming she was supportive of it. All of a sudden, she kept inviting this friend of hers over who is EXTREMELY homophobic when I was home...EVERY NIGHT and he wouldn’t leave until 1-2 AM. I mentioned to her that it made me uncomfortable and she got super defensive, defending him and saying that I need to ‘respect his views’ (even though he literally said I don’t deserve rights.) Now she has shown her true colors and she’s said several passive-aggressive comments about me and my sexuality to my face (including using slurs and making a crude joke about the lengths of my fingers). I am out and proud (I have a pride button on my backpack), but I am not in any means “obnoxious” about my sexuality. I filed a room transfer request, but I am not feeling confident about finding a single/finding a roommate that is accepting. I’ve found a realtor in the area that has helped me find a few inexpensive houses and condos to choose from that are a reasonable distance from campus. I have the financial means to purchase property and I am really considering living there most of the time and staying at the dorm 1-2 nights a week to appear that I still live at the dorm. Should I go through with the room transfer or buy property—and if I should buy property, can I make it believable that I still live in the dorm?",dbx129,osu

How is Greek Life?,11,7,"So I'm a second-year student. This is my first year on campus, and honestly not going too hot. I'm a pretty big introvert, live alone, and am isolating myself. Been looking into ways to.. stop that? and joining a fraternity seems like it might be an option. I'm a first generation college student, so I don't really have anyone to ask, and can't find a ton of information online.

First off, am I still eligible? I meet the requirements I'm seeing for the school, but next fall (when I assume the opportunity will open up again) I'll be a junior. I'll still have a few years to go, but that feels pretty late in my college life to be joining, and don't know if it's even possible anymore.

Secondly, all of the ""official"" information I'm seeing talks about how academic achievement is important, and blah blah blah, but is that accurate? I don't claim to be anywhere near the best student, but I still want to be fairly successful grades-wise. Does the different atmosphere tend to detract from academics?

Thirdly and finally, what is a ballpark on costs usually? I know the organization itself usually has dues. Anything outside of that? At a rough guesstimate, how much would I expect to pay per year/semester? And does it do anything for me outside of membership? (room/board, events, whatever. Totally clueless here.)

In a Housing Emergency Not Sure What To Do,17,8,"\[RESOLVED\]

Thanks to everyone who responded and helped!

Hi all,

I'm currently about to move in to a house close to campus with some friends of mine, but one of them dropped out of the lease at the last second and now we're scrambling trying to find a fourth roommate. I've tired going on the various RIT Housing facebook groups and advertising the opening, but none of them will let me post because the ""confirmation"" email to verify me is never sent to my RIT email address (yes I checked my spam folder). The house is four minutes from RIT Campus, has laundry unit, full kitchen, and is furnished (albeit a bit beat up), I've [linked photos](https://imgur.com/a/57qJHNM) of the space with an imgur album, the biggest downside is that two of us have to share a room, likely me and whoever responds to this. Rent is only \~$300 a month with utilities (can get up to 400 in the winter with heating). The time you rent is totally dependent on you, you can do just the fall semester, both semesters, or all year. DM me if you're interested. If you have any suggestions on where I can go to post this that would be fabulous.

Thank you.

I can't help but think that the only reason I don't have air conditioning in my UC apartment is so housing can save a few bucks before the end of the semester. It has been well over 50 out for a few weeks now.

Housing Question,10,9,"Hello! I’m an incoming freshman, majoring in CIT! I have a question regarding room swap. After the room appointment ended two weeks ago, I became less confident about getting along with the roommate. We may have similar lifestyles but I’m concerned about the communication.

I speak and know little ASL even though I wanted to learn, I just don’t find the time to do it which made me feel discouraged. I have bilateral hearing loss since birth so I speak fluently even though I still have some difficulty pronouncing some words. On the other hand, the roommate that I’ll be with does ASL very well. She doesn’t speak but I was worried that if I struggle communicating with her, we might fall out. It feels like both of us are in totally different worlds. 

So the only way we can communicate is through writing notes and texting.

Housing selection advice and a few general questions,9,24,"Hello everyone;

My housing selection is scheduled for a little more than a week from now. I would like to use this time to prepare and take advice, so I have several questions, but don't feel restricted by them as I'm really looking for any advice:

1. I plan to select a room in Ellingson hall, do you think this is a good choice?
2. Is a higher or lower floor more practical? i.e. does it get really warm on the top floors, how much is it a pain to have to take the elevator, proximity to lounges, etc.
3. I'll be in a double room. How much desk space is there for a PC? Are the beds bunked? Do the rooms reach uncomfortable temperatures?
4. How's the wifi? Should we bring our own routers/ethernet, and are we allowed to? I plan on playing a fair amount of Dota/Starcraft which needs a good connection to keep ping low.
5. What's something you wish you knew when you were selecting your housing?

Now some general questions, not really related to housing:

1. I'm male, planning on regularly hitting the gym, and will possibly be eating a little bit more than someone who doesn't. Is there a particular meal plan you recommend? I can see myself eating 3 meals per day.
2. How's the health center? My high school's health center gives out condoms, does yours? Are services free?
3. I've been told there are two currencies here or something? If someone can clear that up that would be great.
4. Recommended places to eat? I came for an open house in November and saw this Mexican/Chinese place that looked really good; are all the food places as amazing as that?
5. I hear there are a lot of clubs. Where can I find a list of clubs to join, and how do I join one?

As I said, I want to be prepared, so feel free to give any advice, even if it isn't specifically requested in a question. Don't feel like you have to answer everything if you don't want to, as I'm not trying to give you unnecessary stress. Thanks for your time and have a great day.",bsoq6k,rit

"Students in the art and design school who had their portfolio reviewed at an open house, what exactly does it mean when the reviewer accepts your portfolio?",6,1,"I recently went to the open house on the 9th for their 3D Digital Design major with a portfolio and a sketchbook. I had it reviewed and my reviewer loved it. He said I had a great balance of conceptual and technical skills with my models and loved my composition and color usage. He suggested that I work on my reflections and said that the backgrounds for some of my still lives were a little undefined, but that's it.


When he asked if it would be okay if he accepted the portfolio on the form, of course I said yes. I was honored and excited so much that it wrecked my planned schedule. I then saw on the form that it said it doesn't always guarantee that I'll be accepted into RIT.

What ever happened to the lines for all of the visiting chefs? Remember when the Chinese food place (I think it was called Bamboo House?) would bring chicken and lo mein to campus twice a week and create HUGE lines in the SAU and Ritz? I remember a line for the chinese food going from the visiting chef station in Ritz all the way to the back entrance towards the GPC. And what about Talia of India (no, not the current Indian food vendor that comes, I think they're called Tandoor). Talia was so good even though it wasn't super authentic. I remember having a hard time deciding if I wanted Chinese or Indian visiting chef during my freshman year. Now we still have Dino, De Mangu, and Pakistani House (Who will be my first veggy boi?), but I have noticed far less volume for all of these vendors. Now, all I see is lines for the Ritz Pasta Bake, which I still don't understand the hype behind. Even Dino doesn't get that much traffic despite it actually being very good. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is,

Make the visiting chefs great again!

Kidney help,114,11,"Hey RIT redditers, 

&#x200B;

I graduated RIT back in 2016 with a  B.S. in computing security. RIT was the best decisions I have ever made. I have a lot of great memories. After RIT, I started a career at NASA and then I transferred to the Army. As I was transferring my kidneys failed on me and I am now on dialysis 3 days a week. I have polycystic kidney disease which I got from my father. I tried to get a kidney from my mother but she' can't donate due to poor health. 

&#x200B;

I would like to reach out to the RIT community to see if anyone would be willing to donate a kidney to me. I was told I will be waiting on the transplant list for 5-7 years. That will get me a deaced donor. I need a live donor. A live donor's kidney will last 15-25 years or more. However, my doctors are saying that my life on dialysis is about 4 years. This is because the death rate goes up 20% every year you are on dialysis. Some people can go 20 years but not me I don't have the health. 

Now about me, i will take really good care of the kidney. I don't drink alcohol, smoke or do drugs.  I am trying hard to work and serve my country and humanity. I gave up my NASA career for the Army because the army said I could save lives and i have. I have made a positive difference and I would like to continue to do so.  I don't want to let the Army down. I have a great commanding officer and support staff here and to me they are family.  My CO is one of the most intelligent person's I have ever met and I am honored to work with him.

Now let me tell you about dialysis, it takes all of the energy out of you. It drains you every day. Go look at YouTube about Kidney Dialysis. I am trying so hard to do dialysis and stay in the Army. It is also very painful. Every tiny muscle in my legs, hands and feet cramp up all of the time. It's so bad that I am on the floor curled up at work begging for the pain to go away. It's soo embarrassing. The other thing is I am tired all of the time. It's the kind of tired you get where you can't sleep but want to so bad but your body will not let you. 

The Army has been very good to me and are working with me but I don't know if they will wait 5-7 years for me to get a transplant or if they will kick me out. I really want to stay in. 

&#x200B;

The only reason why the Army is keeping me is because I have a unique skill set that's hard to find. 

&#x200B;

I am currently stationed at Fort Meade and the Army will pay for everything. The transplant, food and housing and recovery. 

Now, I am what  you call a Army Civilian it's a hybrid of soldier and federal employee. but I do the same missions as a active duty soldier. I represent a continuity in the Army. 

I am O-positive that's my blood type. I think for you to be a donor you have to be O-positive. 

If you are interested in donating, please call my Transplant care team at 410 614 9345

&#x200B;

and please send me a PM.

"Fell in love with RIT, but not sure financial aid will come through",73,59,"I don't know if this is a good place to ask, but I can't think of anywhere better.

I am a senior in high school that is interested in computer science. My academic record is top-notch (3.98 GPA, 36 ACT), so my peers and counselors have pushed me towards attending a top university. However, after visiting RIT during this month's open house, I fell in love with the campus, its activites, its students... all of it. I liked it so much that I took up an offer to switch my RD application to ED 1.

The problem is that, as we all know, RIT is very expensive. Us incoming freshmen are looking at over $60k/year, and browsing about on this subreddit makes it seem like it isn't going to get any better. I initially hoped that my academic record, resume, recommendation letters, etc. would earn me a large merit scholarship, but RIT has only offered $17.5k/year through the Presidential Scholarship - a good sum compared to most other people's scholarships, but still less than 30% of the cost of attendance.

I'm not sure that I will be able to make up the difference with need-based aid, either. My family is fairly well-off, according to the FAFSA: ~$115k/year adjusted income, ~$33k/year EFC. The thing is, the FAFSA doesn't take two important factors into account:

First, my family has two other children that have graduated from college in the past five or so years. One went to a fairly-expensive private school and didn't receive a large sum of scholarships and grants. The other went to the an in-state public school, but he dropped his college GPA low enough to lose his merit scholarships. This means that my father has already had to cosign on ~$175k in student loans, and he's not sure that he will be able to sign off on another $100k or more for my education.

Second, my family isn't willing to pay $33k/year towards my education. I can go to a local school for a very low cost, low enough that subsidized federal loans will make up the ""out-of-pocket"" costs. I don't think my parents will be willing to put their own money on the line for RIT when I could just go to a different school for nearly-free, even if I prefer RIT much more. I have $20k in college savings, but that's all of the support I'm going to receive.

I *really* want to go to RIT. I think it's a great school that fits well with me, far more than any of the in-state universities I've visited. I just don't know if I'll be able to afford such a steep price. Until I receive my financial aid award, though, can I ask some questions about what to expect, and how I might go about lowering the cost of attendance?

1. How generous is need-based financial aid for middle-class students applying to RIT? I'm sure that I'm not the only student whose family won't pay anywhere near the EFC, so how have other students dealt with the high cost of attendance?

2. Has anyone had issues with getting a cosigner approved for their private student loans? My father thinks we might get denied a loan due to all of the other college debt he has already cosigned on, and I won't be able to afford RIT without such private loans.

3. Will it actually help to explain this situation to RIT's financial aid office? I know other students have gotten slightly better financial aid awards just by asking for more, but has it ever made a significant difference?

Thank you all for your time,

"To Prospective Students,",0,17,"I wanted to make this post for anyone considering attending RIT. Yes, I am aware that this is subjective, and for some, RIT may be the school for them. There is, however, a multitude of problems when it comes to RIT. I'm a third year, and I have to say, just give it some time, and you'll see just how much RIT views their students as profit margins as opposed to students.

&#x200B;

The biggest offender here is housing. In regards to dorms? Yeah, RIT has no problem charging someone who lives in Fish the same amount as someone who lives in Ellingson; totally fair given the lack of lobby, elevator, AC, laundry room, hell even VENDING machines in Fish. Tuition is being raised and all this extra money is coming in... Yet there is still somehow not enough housing for each student. This, paired with the fact that there is also barely enough parking for commuters literally baffles me. After doing a bit of research for five minutes, I can see that this has been a problem for at least five years now... Administration is somehow content just not doing anything about it. If you can somehow avoid giving RIT your money to live on campus, I would.

&#x200B;

Another big problem imo about RIT is that the school loves looking presentable to parents/alumni, but does not care about the experiences of the students that live here. It seems worth talking about the fact that the quarter mile was dangerous to walk down for the past two months, yet they miraculously had all the lights installed for homecoming. A good deal of what you see and hear from the school itself is a front that will slowly unravel itself as you study here.  Take anything the school feeds you with a grain of salt; just because RIT tells you they have alumni working at Google does not mean that every student is going to get a job with a big tech company. This also raises another thought of mine, that RIT on top of being money hungry towards literal teenagers, is grooming you to give money back to them when you graduate. I know that most schools do this, but it seems even more outright offensive when you consider that RIT puts on this polished front when the alumni come around, but refuses to consider the state of the school when they are not.

&#x200B;

Don't even get me started on diversity/community here. Yeah, there are more... niche communities here, but good luck finding a good sense of community if you're a woman of color or LGBT. In the entirety of my major (200+ students), there is one black woman. On top of this, RIT has a prominent lack of mental health support/assistance to LGBT folk; dealt with a homophobic roommate the entirety of last year and housing did zero to help with that. To pair with this, good luck finding people that stray from the cookie cutter norms that RIT has in the first place; for some, this place can feel just like high school.

&#x200B;

The quality of class content can be rather subpar as well. RIT loooves touting the fact that we are the next best thing you'll get to an ivy-league. This is somehow their justification for raising the tuition. Yet, there are still some classes that are pretty much taught exclusively through YouTube videos and a professor's blind reading of PowerPoint slides. Expect a few of your classes to pretty much be glorified online classes.

&#x200B;

All of this being said, you will definitely network through RIT. There is an extensive alumni network, and the co-op process will definitely differentiate you from other graduates. However, the trade-off for the time you spend here and the way that RIT treats you is definitely worth considering.

&#x200B;

TL;DR RIT will probably get you a job in the field you are studying, but make no mistake: they see you as a bag of money more than a student. If you have the GPA for it, and are going into debt... Might as well just take it at an ivy-league.",dlrli8,rit

I understand there are no official “financial aids” for international students. However, I understand each college has its own independent funds and are more able to help in specific situations (or at least have a wider variety of in-course scholarships and prizes).

URGENT PLS: Accepted into UTM Housing and have to pay $1150 fee but I have a conditional IB acceptance,3,5,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

So basically,  I've been accepted and admitted into the UTM Management program starting this upcoming fall off a conditional IB offer (Score of 34/45 IB points). And my offer very vaguely says to 'Maintain"" my grades. Now, IB results come out on July 7th, but my deadline to pay my OPH housing deposit is the 21st of June (2 days from now). My question is, what would happen if I don't meet my condition? I've heard that apparently, UTM is pretty lenient and stuff but still, I'm high key scared sh\*tless and been having a lot of anxiety about this. IF I don't meet my requirements, is there an appeal system? IF so, how likely are they to accept my appeal? Besides, do they even care THAT much about the condition?

Also, lets say they rescind my offer, will I get a refund to the $1150 deposit that they're charging me rn due on the 21st of June? The Housing offer says I have to pay my residence fees by Aug 6 and I'll get my roommate assignment stuff on July 19th.

Also, I am aware that off-campus housing is probably the better option. Just kind of thinking of on-campus housing as a backup option for my first year, as apartment hunting in a city you don't know is pretty difficult. Thanks!! ",b283iy,UofT

I've organised a stitch and bitch at [bampot](http://bampottea.com/) today from 17:00-21:00(ish).

Housing Quest (and Q's for myself and others) / GRAD STUDENT,1,0,"Hello my fellow UofT-ians (and Rotman-ites in particular!)

&#x200B;

Let me begin by saying I am fully aware of the online housing resources provided by the University and am more than capable of checking out kijijii and various Facebook groups. This post is intended to generate discussion that can exist alongside those efforts! Hopefully for the benefit of not only myself but others too.  


I'm a domestic (Canadian) student living in Edmonton starting my Full-Time MBA at Rotman in September, and hoping to arrive in Toronto ideally mid-July but more realistically August 1st.

&#x200B;

I have a cousin in Toronto who said it's best to get serious about the housing search only a month ahead of time. Do y'all agree or disagree? That strikes me as perilously late (and causes me stress headaches) *BUT* I guess I understand that otherwise people don't necessarily know when they will be needing roommates or leaving their current accommodations, etc.

&#x200B;

I have ruled out Grad House (am fantastically late to the party) and CampusOne (pricey). I'd love to live with as few roommates as possible (ideally none, but that's likely impossible) and for those roommates to be quiet, non-party types (e.g. graduate students and/or women are ideal). As background information, I do have a partner (who will not be joining me in Toronto as she will be completing her PhD in Alberta).

&#x200B;

I won't ask for specific leads here (though if you have them, you are welcome to share them and they will be appreciated). I suppose I'm mostly looking for strategy.

&#x200B;

When did you start looking? What were the most helpful resources for you (Kijiji? Facebook? etc). What are some reasonable areas (or even buildings) if I'm basing ""reasonable"" on price and proximity to the University? What do you wish you would have known when you were in my position? 

&#x200B;

I'm open to any and all questions, comments, or discussion whatsoever!

&#x200B;

On a personal note, I very much enjoy pasta and my hobby is whisky (mainly scotch and japanese whiskies). I also love Harry Potter and while I like the Office, I do enjoy reinforcing that liking it is not a personality trait :P Talk to you soon!",bgzhsr,UofT

This break has been SHIT,38,16,"Don't get me wrong, I am really grateful that reading week exists to begin with (sorry to those who don't have one D; ). But to me, one week is just not good enough. I had to catch up on three of my readings, do two homework assignments, and write up two entire papers during that week. I was cooped inside my home with anxiety above me for almost the entire week (which flew by so quickly wtf the break literally felt like a regular weekend grr). I didn't even notice that it was snowing on Friday until my parents told me about the news concerning the TTC shutdown from Pape to St George and saw snow on the TV, like no wonder why it was so cold in my house. I barely had much relaxing on the times I did go outside because I had to go to health clinics. 

But hey, at least I'm all caught up in my classwork right? HA. I haven't got an inch of opportunity to start studying for exams and I really feel unmotivated to do so at the moment, plus pray that the 20% paper I had just conjured up from my ass and submitted a minute before the 11:59 PM due date is not too terrible because my brain at that point just lacked the ability to function properly for the next few weeks. I'm just ready to be more social with the little number of friends I have left, continue my pills, and dread for TWO more papers I will have to write before the even more dreadful exam period since three of my exams are in a span of two days... Just how.

Is UToronto operhyped? Underhyped?,3,10,"I feel like a lot of people go to UToronto simply because its the number 1 uni in Canada. I love the city of Toronto, and the uni being ranked so high is a bonus honestly. 

I was telling some of my friends that UToronto is one of my top options and they kept telling me not to go as I will get absolutely wrecked first year and that the deflation is crazy bad.

I have seriously began to reconsider my top choice now. I am sick and tired of everyone telling me that I will get wrecked first year, and not to go to UToronto. Everyone thinks I want to go to UToronto for the prestige, when really there are so many more factors. I want to go to UToronto because I have never lived in Toronto, and think that it would be an absolutely amazing place to live in, i also love the campus lay out. Not gonna lie, the prestige is a bit important because it may help me get into a good med school or research school, but I know that undergrad isnt that important in Canada.

My main question is: Is it worth it to go to UToronto simply because I love the city of Toronto even though the education will be crazy hard compared to other universities?  For context I am interested in life sci, i am also applying to UBC, UCalgary, UAlberta, and Simon Fraser.

Everyone says to go to UAlberta or UCalgary because it would be the smarter option, cause the program is supposedly easier, but I absolutely love Toronto/Utoronto.I have wanted to go to UToronto, and I am worried that if i dont go there for my undergrad, the chances of me ever going there will be diminshed.",d8x2cf,UofT

Constant Church Bells from Hart House?????,7,10,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I am a visiting student from Winnipeg, taking summer courses at the U of T. I am staying at University College (Morrison Hall) and for the past month (?) or so I have been being driven absolutely bananas by the constant church bells being played out of the Hart House bell tower. This is completely unbelievable. They play seemingly all day, for 30 minutes or so every hour? Or, for an hour at a time taking a few breaks throughout the day? I haven't been able to work out their exact schedule yet. But it seems to be basically all of the time, with 20 minute stops.

&#x200B;

Can anyone comment on this? Is this a temporary thing? I don't remember them being this bad when I first got here. Is there some Christian cause of celebration that I'm unaware of? Will this end in the foreseeable future? I have googled it and can't seem to turn anything up. But as soon as I find out some sort of responsible body, I plan to write immediately in complaint. This is ridiculous. Once a week would be fine, or every day for 10-15 minutes. But all day, 5 days a week? Cannot understand this. I feel like I'm going to explode.

Can U of T Student Life help you find housing?,3,0,I remember overhearing some other students discussing housing with some kind of advisor at student life.

Experience with Health & Wellness (Mental Health) (no TW),12,10,"Had an appointment booked 2 weeks ago, because I specifically wanted to get assessed for ADHD. (I mean, to get a referral for it)
Appointment was at 10am today, doctor was late (got called in at 10.16am). I totally understand appointments “carrying-over” to the next, but the very least she could do was to acknowledge that she was running late... :( 

Anyway so the first step to getting assessed for ADHD you’d have to fill in this generic CAMH (I think) scale/form thing that the nurse gives you. (oh wait before that when you’re checking in at the computer you also do this quiz which asks you questions about your mental health)
So I did that when I spoke to the nurse, and when I walked in - the doc didn’t take the form from me, and immediately started asking me questions regarding general mood disorders.

So I answered the questions, and she concluded that I could have some kind of mood disorder and said that there could be overlaps between ADHD and yknow depression and all. But she never ONCE asked me anything that was ADHD-specific —> she really seemed *eager to categorize them under some other disorders*... :( 

Ookay here comes the best part - she told me to work-out. I had to look at her straight in the eyes and told her that I don’t think that’ll be possible. I don’t think how I’m going to “make” myself workout when there are dark days when leaving house is difficult. (etc.) & she repeated, I should start from brisk walking x minutes per day................ I mean, I KNOW. I KNOW working out is good for me, physical or mental health-wise. But it would honestly hurt much less if she had recognized that I am going through some bad times, and this just isn’t an option for the time being.

So after the working-out part - since she couldn’t give me any formal diagnosis, she’d like to refer me to a psychiatrist. Because I’m not in crisis/ non-suicidal, I was given a “moderate” severity situation and my appointment is (?) time in December. I’d have to pick up a call to get an appointment scheduled (also no clue when the call is coming). She said that she wanted to get me assessed for “some kind of” mood disorders (main point), and then only followed up to say that “(patient) thinks that she has ADHD”. 

The whole process was utterly dismissive, and I was just so upset throughout and started crying after I left the building (no shame in crying but ya).

Oh and throughout the appointment, she never once looked at my generic ADHD-scale form thing and she only collected it at the end. The appointment lasted 15 minutes.

I am really lost. If there’s anyone at the school who got assessed while being here (for ADHD), I would love to hear from you.

More Student Housing on N. Main,16,2,">The Blacksburg Planning and Building Department has received a request to rezone 5.550 acres of existing commercial and residential property . . . at 1009-1107 North Main Street, (and other addresses along Montgomery Street and Broce Drive) for the development of a mixed use multi-family and commercial development. The development proposal includes the construction of one 4-6 story multi-family building with integrated parking deck. The proposed building will have a proposed maximum height of 70'  containing a total of 218 units with a maximum of 825 bedrooms (147 bedrooms per acre). A total of 4 units will be ""Live/Work"" units where both residential and commercial uses will exist. The development also includes 17,8000 square feet of commercial space. The applicant is proposing a minimum of 0.80 parking spaces per bedroom, plus dedicated spaces for commercial use.   
>  
>See [http://www.blacksburg.gov/town-council/meetings/public-hearings/rzn19-0001-the-standard-multi-family-and-commercial-development](http://www.blacksburg.gov/town-council/meetings/public-hearings/rzn19-0001-the-standard-multi-family-and-commercial-development)

This development, being proposed by Landmark, builder of The Retreat (the company is the Walmart of student housing in college towns), will replace houses and businesses from Abby's (which isn't part of the project) to Price's gas station. There is already concern about the lack of parking being proposed (the argument for the 0.8 is that students won't need a car because they can walk/bus to and from campus). This is Landmark's fifth attempt at cashing in on the student housing market in Blacksburg (it proposed a project off Glade Rd., it was lined up to buy the Blacksburg Baptist Church property until the town wouldn't take houses on Progress St. out of the historic district, it tried and failed to build The Retreat on Prices Fork in its first attempt, but was successful in swaying town council on its second).

There will be a public hearing on Tuesday, June 4, at 7:30 pm at the town hall before the Blacksburg Planning Commission, which has been studying the project since plans were submitted on March 1. The Planning Commission will eventually make a recommendation on what to do to the Blacksburg Town Council (strictly advisory, town council can ignore the advice and take a different course). The timetable for the PC report, town council work session, and town council public hearing and vote has not been set.

Like The Retreat, this project will have a variety of apartment sizes, from studio to five bedrooms. There will be a pool and other amenities. Like with The Retreat, Landmark is claiming ""The Standard at Blacksburg development will serve to create additional housing opportunities in an existing multi-family residential area adding to the available multi-family housing inventory. This will allow young professionals and families to potentially reclaim the traditional neighborhoods."" (see the ""Comprehensive Plan Analysis"" in the revised plan at [http://www.blacksburg.gov/home/showdocument?id=8485](http://www.blacksburg.gov/home/showdocument?id=8485) ).

Although a question was asked at the neighborhood meeting about rental rates, no answer is recorded. Given the amenities and the rates at The Retreat, rent won't be cheap.

Keep an eye on this to see what proffers turn town council's heads.",bv7grc,VirginiaTech

""HOME"" is a large-scale performance work that explores and explodes the  relationship between “house” and “home.” A visual physical spectacle,  “HOME” combines dance, illusion, live music, home-spun engineering, and  an inventive use of audience interaction to compose a work that asks,  “Where is home? If it is not a place, what is home?” On stage, a house  appears from nothing. It goes up fast, choreographed like time-lapse  photography. Residents move in, move out, get married and divorced in  it, grow up in it, die in it, haunt it. “HOME” aims to awaken us to  current housing dilemmas, local and global.

Thinking about transferring from VCU to tech - Advice please,3,18,"Hi there!

This will be a bit of a long post but bare with me. VCU was my first choice school, since I can't drive due to my vision I was excited to be somewhere that always had stuff going on. I really do like the city of Richmond, and I love the diversity, but there's been a lot of things that VCU doesn't seem to have. I didn't think I wanted a ""traditional"" college experience, but I find I'm really missing a sense of community and ""college"" feel. I've tried clubs and putting myself out there but I still don't feel connected to my school. I feel really lonely and it doesn't feel like many people are excited to be here. My hall isn't social at all, our RA's don't do anything, and most on campus events are non-existent or a flop. It just isn't feeling right and we're coming to the end of the first semester. (I posted about my feelings in the VCU subreddit if you wanna look at my post history)

I read online there's no way to do spring semester transfer, right? What's it like transferring as a sophomore? Is it hard to fit in? Do you miss out? Does campus get boring? Is there lots of stuff to do? How accepting are people? Upperclassman, are you still enjoying being at Virginia tech? Also, this is a bit random, but I was considering joining a sorority at VCU, if I do, I couldn't join one at tech, right? What classes should I take if I decide I want to transfer? If anyone has come from VCU I'd love to hear from you!

EDIT: WHOOPS I'd like to add that the Mayvery account is mine, logged in on the wrong one.

Thanks for taking the time.",dt6qu2,VirginiaTech

Here's to a fun weekend and a safe trip home and back to Blacksburg for all those traveling! Happy Thanksgiving and Break!",dzq6uq,VirginiaTech
Subletting my room in the spring 2021?,2,1,"I’m a junior anticipating on graduating early. However, I’m stumped on what to do for housing. I might choose to renew my lease at Foxridge, but I have absolutely no plans of sticking around in Blacksburg post-graduation. I guess getting to the point. Roughly how successful would I be in getting someone to take over the lease or sublet my room for the spring semester and summer? I’ve seen quite a few posts of people graduating this year in December, but not a lot of buzz on their posts. Also kinda deviating, if I can’t get a sublessee would I be possibly eligible to return to campus housing after moving off? I just don’t want to pay rent for something I don’t plan to use anymore.",dpt3w0,VirginiaTech

UPS Fucked up (anyone else?),29,24,"Anyone else had a problem with UPS delivery this week? I was supposed to get a package on Thursday and it was delayed for “emergency weather”. Fast forward the next day and I still don’t have the package. It was then marked delivered at 11:07 pm (way later than UPS’s normal delivery time). Go back home from DT once I got the notification and the package wasn’t there. Called UPS the next morning and they said they delivered it to some random ass place in Blacksburg. Went over to the address that they said they “delivered” it and asked the guys there and lo and behold, they said they never got any packages.Either they were lying or UPS is royally fucked up...and I’m more inclined to believe that UPS is the culprit in this scenario. 

Anyone else experiencing similar fuckery?

I was wondering if anybody has anything positive or negative to say about these three options. If there is a better option that comes to mind, please state it. I am looking for a quiet place that is free of most parties, but is also a lively community. ",9oedlf,VirginiaTech

The email all students just got... already had problems with too many students LAST year...,40,45," [**A message from Patricia A. Perillo, vice president for Student Affairs**](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#m_-4925022733862966100_)

Dear current Hokie student and Hokie family members,  


I hope this letter finds you safe, well, and enjoying the start of your summer break, whether that includes classes, an internship or job, service, or travel. I also hope you find some time for rejuvenation, relaxation, and fun.  


We have heard from students that many are concerned about the size of our incoming class. As you know, Virginia Tech is undergoing a period of managed growth to achieve an undergraduate population of 30,000 by 2023, but the larger-than-expected response to offers of admission this year far exceeded both our expectations and our plan.   


Based on the results of a survey completed by students who accepted offers of admission, we believe that this was due to the high visibility and academic reputation of our university and enhanced recruitment and admissions procedures that were implemented this year.  Clearly, the enrollment management model used to establish the numbers of applicants offered admission will need further development in the future, and we are actively engaged in accomplishing this necessity.  


I am reaching out today to let you know that we are committed to maintaining a quality student experience and are working diligently to accommodate the larger incoming class. As a campus community, Virginia Tech is working to ensure that all of our new and returning Hokies have an amazing student experience.  


To manage the higher-than-expected enrollment in a manner that preserves and advances the educational experience for both incoming and continuing students, the Provost has assembled a team of campus leaders to work collaboratively to develop strategies for accommodating academic, housing, dining, wellness needs, and more. We are finding solutions and using the financial resources generated by the increased enrollment to serve the entire student community. We are making good progress.  


If you haven’t already, I encourage you to check out our site for entering first-year students [\#VT23 Frequently Asked Questions](https://t.send.vt.edu/r/?id=h86f727,14d0631,14d0634&utm_source=cmpgn_vtmail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelDirectEmailCMP_DM84136). The FAQ page includes information on housing and Living-Learning Programs, dining, Orientation, parking, and counseling services that may interest you. We will continue to add content to this resource page in response to community needs, requests and questions.  


If you have questions regarding this larger-than-expected first-year class that are not addressed in the #VT23 FAQ, send an email to [askvt@vt.edu](mailto:askvt@vt.edu) and the appropriate office will respond. Your questions will help us build out the FAQ page so that your inquiries and our responses can assist others.  


It is important that we keep you informed by sharing all we are doing so that both returning students and new students have the best opportunity to thrive as they [ExperienceVT](https://t.send.vt.edu/r/?id=h86f727,14d0631,14d0635&utm_source=cmpgn_vtmail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelDirectEmailCMP_DM84136). As returning students and “seasoned” family members, you can model the Virginia Tech motto, *Ut Prosim* (That I May Serve), by welcoming, assisting, guiding, and befriending our newest Hokies.  


Students and their families are excited about the opportunities presented by a Virginia Tech education, and we are excited to do the most we can to provide the very best experience for all our students. Thank you for your unwavering loyalty and undaunted Hokie spirit.  


Have a wonderful summer! I look forward to seeing you in August!",bx4hca,VirginiaTech

[**23. Silkroad Ensemble in Concert with “Falling Out of Time”**](http://www.nextthreedays.com/FeaturedEventDetails.cfm?E=517702)  
**Moss Arts Center at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg**  
**Sunday, November 17, 2019, 7:00 - 8:30 PM**  
**Adult Tickets (based on seat location): $40.00-75.00, Students with ID and Youth 18 and Under: $10.00**  
For this performance, Silkroad has teamed up with composer Osvaldo Golijov to conceive a brand new song cycle, ""Falling Out of Time"", based on Israeli writer David Grossman’s book exploring grief and loss. The work features vocalist Wu Tong and singer-songwriter Nora Fischer. Drawing on the English translation of the text, Golijov has conceived this hour-long song cycle for 13 members of the Silkroad Ensemble, the collective whose delicacy of musical expression he describes as like “a harp of a thousand hairs.” Yo-Yo Ma conceived Silkroad in 1998 as a reminder that even as rapid globalization resulted in division, it brought extraordinary possibilities for working together. In a radical experiment, he brought together musicians from the lands of the Silk Road to co-create a new artistic idiom, a musical language founded in difference, a metaphor for the benefits of a more connected world. Today, these Grammy Award-winning artists seek and practice radical cultural collaboration in many forms, creating and presenting new music, teacher and musician training workshops, and residency programs in schools, museums, and communities.

I am an international student (Indian), attending virginia tech this fall for engineering as a freshman. Currently I am having hard time choosing where to live....On-Campus or Off-Campus.

I'm an undergraduate junior, but in looking at all these housing listings that specify grad-only I'm wondering if that's actually some sort of rule or if it just means they're looking for people who don't throw parties and aren't loud.

So there is no guarantee for the owner if I don't deposite and I just say I'm going to arrive at this date, so I will be losing those rooms to others.

I'm arriving in the second week of August and I will have a problem if I have not a place to stay by then. Yet, I fear to rent before arriving since I don't know anyone here. So far, I'm planing in renting with airbnb for a week, then look for a room while in the city, now being able to meet them in person.

Would one week suffice to look for a room? I hope so, airbnb is cheap but not by a lot, so I can't afford much time in one.

Transfer student coming in spring and i have housing questions,1,2,I'm currently applying for housing for spring and transfer students are locked to rosen for spring only.

Housing Questions,2,3,"So I was just admitted for Summer 2020 as a freshman and I had a few questions about housing since it's best to apply as soon as it opens up (hopefully in the coming weeks).

As seen below, Towers is my first choice by far from the things I've heard. After that I would probably go with Neptune or Hercules/Nike.

&#x200B;

1.  It is my understanding that the Towers are a year-round agreement for an apartment for Fall-Spring-Summer. Since I am going in Summer 2020, would I have to stay in another room just for that semester, or do they offer a Summer-Fall-Spring agreement?

2. How are the room priorities made? Is it determined by application date (like UF) or just how lucky you are? Also, when do you get your official room assignments?

3. How exactly do roommate groups work? I have a few friends who are applying to UCF right now and obviously haven't gotten a decision back yet. I'm just wondering because if I get a room in one of the popular residences and they haven't applied for housing yet will they be able to join my group?  I know at UF the person with the earliest housing app date is assigned as ""leader"" and can choose a room before a group is formed. 

&#x200B;

If I think of anything else I'll edit this.

Thanks.",dlpmsb,ucf

Opinions On Certain Apartment Complexes,6,21,"Currently, I live in NorthView, and the internet situation here is well, **FUCKED**, to say the least. That, along with a few other factors, such as how expensive it is to live here compared to other places, have made me decided on moving out of here after my contract is up. 

Therefore, I was looking to see if anyone could provide any insight on the following apartment complexes as I’m considering them as of right now. I’ve looked at some of the Google and Facebook Reviews, but I don’t know if I should really trust them or not. Some reviews make it seem as if the place is flat out horrible, and that no one should ever live there, while others suggest it’s a fantastic place to love. This dichotomy in the views of the complexes are what’s making me feel indecisive on where to live next year. Anyway, here is my list of considerations:

* Knight’s Circle

* Plaza on University

* The Retreat at Orlando

* The Lofts

* University House

* Orion on Orpington

* Victoria Place

* Northgate Lakes

* Tivoli

* Village at Science Drive

* Hub On Campus


I realize that this is a large list, and that I should probably narrow my selection to more like 3-5 complexes, but for now I want to keep my options open, and see what the best one is overall, before I start narrowing down my choices based on my preferences. 

Thank you in advance for your help, I appreciate it.",e7nbh5,ucf

The fact that a lot of students are from out of state and don't even have cars/take up a space, yet still there aren't enough parking spaces, astounds me.

I have read that anything south of Michigan Ave. should be avoided- is this still the case? Good and bad experiences all welcome.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some\_insights\_from\_a\_professor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/aelmkt/some_insights_from_a_professor/)

Hi all, I've been teaching at Davis for the last three years (on sabbatical this year). In my smaller classes I normally make it a required assignment that students come to one office hours appointment during the quarter, so I've spent a lot of time over the last three years talking to you all. I wanted to share some things I have learned during that time.

1) *No, everyone doesn't already have their friend groups sorted out.No, you aren't the only one that is lonely or having a hard time meeting people. Yes, it is harder to meet people through clubs than everyone says.*

This is a running theme with all my students. They discuss being lonely and feeling like they missed some important window to make friends. They discuss how it seems like everyone is already paired off besides them and how they go to clubs, which is the conventional ""how do I meet people at Davis?"" advice but they still can't seem to meet people. Making friends is hard, making friends at Davis is extra hard. People are very friendly but I think few people have the capacity to be real friends. Keep going to club meetings if you enjoy the people and the space, try something different if you don't, but don't keep going if you don't like it hoping to meet people. You might to need accept that people here are busy and it might be a lonely few years for you. I guarantee you that the people that seem soooo happy with soooo many friends for the most part aren't. I have had SO many queen bee sorority girls and frat guys who appear to be swimming in friends break down in my office because they also feel like they don't belong and can't meet people (while surrounded with people). So even the ones that look happy generally aren't and it isn't just you. Its also never too late to find people, even if it comes in your second or third or fourth year.

2) *There is a weird code of silence at Davis where we all act like we love the school, the city, and the lifestyle so much and no one is ever suffering.*

I don't know why but Davis has a bit of a cult thing happening. If you love Davis great! I am happy you have found your home and your tribe. But if you don't love it, and you feel alone in that, you aren't. And its okay not to love it. I know no one will ever admit it but lots of things about Davis suck. The quarter system is awful and cruel. The weather can be hard to handle. Housing is impossible. Its okay to be stressed. Admitting you don't love Davis probably won't win you any friends because for some reason it is a sin to talk about anything negative at this school, but again, more of you than you would believe are having a really hard time. I absolutely promise you that.

3) *Yup, you spend most of your day feeling stupid, feeling less than, and feeling like you aren't smart enough for Davis.*

So do lots of your fellow students. Almost every student who I have taught in the last three years feels stupid at Davis and like everyone else is smarter than them and they have no idea what is going on. Other people are not smarter than you, I know, I see their grades. The ones that aren't worried about feeling dumb are the ones that should be.

4) *No, everyone else doesn't have it all figured out.*

I start every quarter by sizing up my classes. Who is the class clown, who are the ones that will participate, who are the ones that I don't have to worry about, and who are the ones I will have to try to remember exist, because they say nothing and have very little presence. I myself am consistently surprised when the students I don't think I need to worry about, because they seem to have it all figured out, come into my office and fall to pieces because they have no idea what they are doing. It isn't just you. Below the surface like 80% of you are totally lost. Its just that no one will admit it. Its NORMAL.

Davis may be, up until this point, one of the hardest things you have ever done. You may feel dumb, lonely, lost, and depressed. But you aren't alone. If you find some people that seem a little less fake than the normal try opening some of that up a little, you will likely find others feel just like you but can't drop the walls long enough to admit it. You may need to accept that Davis won't be all the things you wanted. You might not make lifelong friends. You may not retain your perfect GPA. You may not get invited to a party every weekend (hell or any weekend). But the years go by fast with the quarter system and you will be graduating before you know it. If nothing else, find a way to keep your head down and get through the work. Maybe make a priorities list. Ask yourself what you *really* want from this experience and focus your energy there. Are friends and a traditional college experience your priority? Is it personal growth? Travel? Finding a career? Or just getting the degree? You likely can't have them all, because we are all only human and the quarter system will take so much from you as it is. Focusing on some realistic priorities and not setting yourself up to fail by trying to have all the things and then feeling like shit when that doesn't work is what I have seen make this experience worthwhile for a lot of my students.

Best of luck to you all. Remember, whatever it is you are feeling, you aren't alone.",e38vd9,uofm

I have been looking into housing and was wondering if anyone could help me decide what would be best for me to apply/look into?

* I know there are different types of on-campus housing: Classic residential halls, Deluxe Residential halls, Residential suites and Plazas.
* Along with University apartments: Gayley Court, Glenrock, Glenrock West, Landfair, Landfair Vista, Westwood Chateau and Westwood Palm.
* Co-op Housing
* And general apartments near UCLA.

My priority for housing is definitely to have a social experience. However, I am also wondering what is a financially-viable option whilst still having a “college experience?”

If anyone has heard from other exchange students about their housing experience and advice, this would also be extremely helpful!!

I will try my best to answer them but ask here first before going to the main site.** I'm only going to be talking about triples because pretty much all of you have that. 

\*DISCLAIMER\* I don't work for housing, this is just information I've either pulled from the internet or just from living on campus.

&#x200B;

CLASSICS

Room/bathroom info: Rooms aren't as cramped as you expect; all three of us can be in at once and I won't feel crowded. Bathrooms are cleaned twice a day so they stay relatively clean (girl's bathroom has a lot of hair tho lol). I haven't had to wait in line for a shower yet, but it might happen. You do not have AC but I haven't had any issues with it so far. I'm also not in my room that often so I don't really feel it. Definitely get a fan though, sometimes you just need to air out the room.

&#x200B;

HEDRICK HALL

Pros: Almost all freshman! Very social, you have The Study downstairs (little take out place that accepts swipes, I go there at least once a day). You will meet a lot of people and there's always some kind of activity

Cons: The farthest classic residential hall, it can get a little loud and overwhelming especially for people who like their space. I still recommend it.

&#x200B;

RIEBER HALL

Pros: It's closer! And central. Everything is about the same distance from Rieber Hall which is nice. It is also majority freshmen, but not as social (not socially dead, just not to the extent as Hedrick). You also have Rendevous (another swipe take out place) and Feast (dining hall)

Cons: Honestly there aren't a lot of cons, maybe that it's not as freshmen-heavy so they may not have as many activities. Rieber is always a pretty good option.

&#x200B;

SPROUL HALL

Pros: It's even closer to campus! It's also VERY central so you can go anywhere from Sproul. You have Cafe 1919, Bruin Cafe, the campus store, the mailing center, and Covel (dining hall). A lot of LLCs are also in Sproul Hall. The bathrooms are also supposedly a little nicer (idk about this).

Cons: It is mainly second-years, so you might not meet that many freshmen. The few freshmen I know who live there don't have any problem with meeting other freshmen (you meet a lot of people in classes).

&#x200B;

DYKSTRA

Pros: VERY CLOSE TO CAMPUS like it's as close as you can possibly get from the Hill. You have De Neve downstairs (dining hall). The rooms are also really nice! I've been up there a few times and rooms have a lot of storage space.

Cons: It's definitely the quietest out of the classics, but not too bad. Also, people complain about the bathrooms but I thought they were fine.

&#x200B;

PLAZAS

Rooms/bathrooms: These rooms are more spacious and have AC. There's also the shared/private bathroom (you either share one bathroom between you and roommates, or with your room and the room next door. They get cleaned once (edited) a week but they don't get too rank.

Okay so I don't know a lot about plazas, but the order of distance from campus (farthest to closest)

HEDRICK SUMMIT > RIEBER TERRACE/VISTA > SUNSET VILLAGE > DE NEVE

They're a little quieter, but most people seem to still meet the people on their floor so don't worry too much.

A note from [Ghg155127](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghg155127): Courtside (in SV) is the most secluded of the five.

A note from [ramer120](https://www.reddit.com/user/ramer120): De Neve Plazas are fairly smaller than those in Rieber T/V and Hedrick Summit. Bathrooms area cleaned 1 time per week.

&#x200B;

SUITES

Yeah, I don't know anything about these sorry. There's Hitch (far) and Saxon (not as far?) but that's all I know. People say they're socially dead but that's not completely true. And ultimately, even if you do live in a classic, it's up to you to reach out and meet people.

&#x200B;

BONUS MEAL PLAN INFO (ranked in order of decreasing cost)

**19P** Most swipes, most flexibility. You have 209 swipes (19 per week for 10 weeks plus finals) to use however you want throughout the quarter. Edit from [yikeshands](https://www.reddit.com/user/yikeshands): they roll over each week but not each quarter

**14P** Fewer swipes, most flexibility. You have 154 swipes to use just like 19P. This averages about 2 meals per day. Good for people who don't like to eat breakfast. Also roll over each week but not quarter.

NOTE ABOUT THE PREMIER MEAL PLANS from [mbshark](https://www.reddit.com/user/mbshark): All 209/154 swipes are loaded to your BruinCard at the beginning of the quarter and you can swipe when you want and as much as you want

**19R** (What I have!!) I LOVE 19R. Most swipes, less flexibility. You still have 209 swipes, but you can use up to 5 per day a total of 19 per week. You can only swipe once per meal period. The meal periods are:

Weekday:

Breakfast: 7am-11am

Lunch: 11am-5pm

Dinner: 5pm-9pm

Late night: 9pm-12am

Late late night: 12am-2am

&#x200B;

Weekend:

Continental breakfast: 7am-9am

Brunch: 9:30am-5pm (This can be tough for us R folks because if we swipe at 10am, we can't swipe again until 5pm)

Dinner 5pm-9pm

Late night: 9pm-12am

Late late night: 12am-2am

I'm still not totally sure about the late late night thing, but the 19R averages around 3 meals per weekday and 2 per weekend. It's cheap, you get a lot of meals, but you just have to plan a little more. Your 19 meals per week reset Monday at 2am (after late late night) Thank you [bearsaysbueno](https://www.reddit.com/user/bearsaysbueno) for the clarification. 19R for the win!

**14R** Fewer swipes, less flexibility. Same as 19R, but you can only use 14 swipes per week. Good for people who either go home often or who skip breakfast and will be on the Hill to use their swipes.

**11R** Least number of swipes, less flexibility. Good for people who go home on weekends.

ALSO they recently added this vending machine thing at the Study that accepts swipes! So if you have to be somewhere at 5 am or you sleep at 3am, you can use a meal swipe at this vending machine and get a sandwich/yogurt plus a fruit/chips and a drink. It's still pretty new so I'm not sure how to use it.

Drop any questions/concerns below. There's also hella youtube videos that explain this. Welcome home, baby bruins!

In the past my mom has been the only one to support me and my two siblings, however, since college she only has to care for me, but she’s still struggling. My mom is very loving and supportive but she’s not at a state to provide me with financial needs. I don’t want to live with my mom anymore and I’m learning how to be more independent. It’s been really rough trying to find a place to live especially because I won’t get any support from my parent, and I only earn about $400 a month.

"Housing question: Aspire, The Avenue South, Copper Beech Townhomes or Crestview",4,7,"Hey guys,

I'd like to thank you guys for the amazing info you've provided on this sub! It helped a lot in getting to know the university, carriers, etc.

I'm currently going through the hosing options, and the following are the ones I'm considering:

Aspire, The Avenue South, Copper Beech Townhomes or Crestview

&#x200B;

\-Aspire is newly built and close to campus, but the rent is a bit high. I went trough their floor plans and I think my best option is a two bedroom, two bath floor plan. I have a few questions regarding Aspire apartments:

1- Are there any real pictures available? All the sample photos are rendered images designers usually show the costumers and they don't really say much about these apartments, their furniture and other features. Do you guys have any info about them?

2- How are flat-mates assigned? Does the university have an assignment mechanism or is it just random? I've always lived alone and it's a bit risky getting a roommate without knowing them in advance(which is also the case for the other person becoming my flat-mate).

3- Do you think they would become cheaper as we approach August, or there's a chance that the prices might go higher or they get filled?

&#x200B;

\-Also The Avenue South seemed pretty good, but it's a bit far. And I don't have a clue about public transport, especially during winter.  How is the access to shopping centers and other day-to-day life stuff?

&#x200B;

\-What do you guys think about Copper Beech and Crestview? Copper Beech seems to be more modern compared to Crestview.

&#x200B;

\-How are the leases in general? any suggestions and things to look out for?

&#x200B;

\-In your opinion, is it better to book in advance or come and visit the apartments in person and then sign the lease.

&#x200B;

I would very much appreciate it if you could share your experience regarding these apartments or housing in general.

Getting out of a housing contract this late on.,0,4,"So bear with me and please, serious responses only. 

I am currently contracted to an on-campus dorm. I made the decision along with my family, that it would be best to move onto an apartment this year, and signed a lease not too long ago. However, when I attempted to get out of my housing contract, I was met with definite backlash. 

They essentially had me put my name on a “release waitlist” without asking for any details of the situation and then I was “denied” the very next morning. Now they are telling me the only way out of the contract is to buy it out for nearly $6,000, unless I simply don’t go to Purdue in the Fall. 

I realize that this is a situation of my own creation, but let me explain a little further. I had contacted the Division of Financial Aid several times in regards to this, as I am a student that relies heavily on financial aid. They ASSURED me that this process would be extremely easy and that getting my financial if transferred to off-campus housing would be easy as 1,2,3. Also, two years ago, I left purdue in the spring for an internship, and when I did that there was almost no resistance to my cancelling my housing contract. It was never made clear to me that I was only allowed to do so because I wasn’t taking classes in the fall. The combination of these factors had me fully believing that this process would be routine. 

Oh how I was wrong. I’ve tried to contact some of the “higher ups” in student housing, but none of them will return my emails. I could have tunnel vision, but as I see it there are only two outcomes here. First is that they cancel my housing contract, somehow, someway. Like I said I am reliant on financial aid and there is no way I can afford to buy out this contract. My second option, it would seem, is to leave Purdue in order to cancel the housing contract. 

This is terrifying. The concept of having to give up my education over a simple lapse in communication and planning has me feeling trapped to say the least. Surely there must be some alternative, but as things are, I don’t see one. If anyone else has any experience like this or any advice it would be greatly appreciated.",cnml57,Purdue

Hi I am an international Transfer student and I have a few questions with regards to the meal plans offered by the university,8,20,"One of my friends who is also transferring to Purdue told me that he signed up for a meal plan, as such I searched it up and I have a couple questions with regards to it  


I am mostly interested in the unlimited 250 plan for $ 5172 per year, as the only difference I see is the additional 250 dollars for the unlimited 500 plan  


What exactly can I do with these dining dollars? It says I can use them in retail locations or within Purdue Memorial Union ( what exactly does this mean?) I assume retail locations means Chick Fil A, Mcdonalds and such  


20+ meals per week vs Unlimited access to all campus dining locations for meals and snacks ( I assume that I can eat 21 meals per week? Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner as well as snacks??)   


As I have no idea how much groceries cost in the states as well as my friends leaning towards the meal plans, is this a good option considering I most probably will be living on campus as well.  


  
Furthermore with regards to housing, I dont seem to be able to select a term in order to begin the on campus housing procedures, any ideas?

uhhhh substance free housing? sos,12,16,"so to begin, i am a dumbass. basically, i’m an avid weed smoker (sometimes drink or take shrooms) but i manage to prioritize. im an incoming sophomore and i got deans list both semesters last year and i’m in the top 10% of my class (this is only relevant so you understand i’m not academically stupid, i just lack common sense). i was trying to find the room dimensions of my single in carroll hall and i have, just now aka a few days before move in, realized i am in a substance free housing program. so like why tf didn’t i check this earlier. 
does anyone know what substance free halls are like? if i’m smoking carts that don’t smell do you think people would notice? if i’m caught with drugs am i put on academic or housing probation? 
i went through a lot of hard struggles last year (family problems, financial, mental, etc) so i was very antisocial and didn’t make many friends. it didn’t help that my roommate was straight edge, hardcore religious who never wanted people over, music up load, etc. i was looking forward to making friends this semester but i’m bummed about my housing and also kinda nervous it’s just going to be a rerun from last year. any advice or answers would be appreciated",csc0ys,UMD

**What are my options for summer housing and beyond?**

Well for the summer you will have options to sublease in Commons/Courtyards, the View and Varsity, CP Towers, or another off campus housing option. Each of these will have different prices and amenities so you should look at their websites. Check out [Off Campus Housing Services](https://och.umd.edu/resources/) for more info.

transfer housing?,7,5,"Hey y’all! I’m transferring currently for the Fall 2019 semester and have heard a lot about transfers not getting housing assignments at all. I was preparing to live at home and dealing with the bad commute since I would have to get to UMD using metro and shuttles. However, I got an email recently saying that I will be getting a housing assignment by July 24th. 


This was kind of exciting since I know how annoying it is to commute from home to school and back everyday but I’m also really confused. Since it’s so rare for transfers to even get housing (I’ve heard the percentage is around 7.6%) the only info about transfer housing on the reslife page is that you’re probably not getting housing.  I was wondering if anyone knew what type of housing these few transfers get? Are they housed in freshman dorms or upperclassmen dorms? Are they given freshman, upperclassmen, or transfer roommates? Are they given the worse/last pick for  housing? Is this email just a glorified waitlist that all transfers get? Any info is appreciated. Thank you!",bplnwl,UMD

The Varsity back on its-,42,9,"I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

Our first full month electricity bill at the varsity was twice that of any of our friends, around $80(per person).

All the Kirbster could do was give us a picture of a spreadsheet with a meter number on it, tell us there was nothing wrong with our meter, and give us tips about conserving electricity like turning the lights off or using the dishwasher less. Thanks. The next month our bill was back to between 30-40ish each which is in the range of what our friends had.

I saw some yelp reviews on the varsity talking about their bills going up for no apparent reason by $30, has anyone else experienced this or does anyone have any ideas on how we could be unknowingly using $160 extra worth of electricity?

Prospective CS transfer student.,2,4,"Hello. Maryland resident here.

So right now I'm attending community college (CCBC) and I would like to go over my options for transferring. I have thought about three different schools. UMD, UMBC, and Towson. Mainly, I've been thinking about either Towson or UMD.

I know that UMD is considered a top school for cs, but I'm scared that it would take a long time for me to graduate. I am going to be at CC  for 3 semesters at the very least and then after that I would have to take technical sequence due to CS courses not transferring here. On top of that, I would not be able to commute and would more than likely have to live off campus due to the horrible housing situation I have heard about here.

If I were to transfer to Towson however, it would just be a short drive away. I wouldn't have to pay for housing and articulation agreements would allow for me to essentially graduate on time.

So, I'm just wondering if it would be worth it to give up going to UMD for a degree at a smaller and less known state school. It's not like I have to work for some big tech company. I just want a job haha. Thanks for reading.",e5s2br,UMD

Stupid football game cancelled buses,57,20,"Edit: Fixed DOTS username

I'm writing this as I am walking to Kung Fu Tea from North Campus in the dark during rain, because this dumb game has, for some reason, cancelled/redirected all buses (including WMATA Metrobus) on campus (except the 104 Metro Shuttle-UM). Who thought that the best way to handle a large crowd on campus is to cut off almost all of the mass transit?

And what about us students? We're the ones who pay tens of thousands of dollars to be on this campus. But thanks to the sport where people can watch students get permanent neurological damage (football sure is cool, right?), we can't even have the Grocery Shopping Shuttle running on the ONLY day that it runs to go get groceries? And, we can't even have buses to the stores and restaurants on Route 1 either? What are we supposed to do, stay shut in our dorms all day?

How about off-campus students? Such as those who live in the houses, Courtyards, Varsity, View, Enclave, MGM, etc??? They have no way to get to stores or campus? What if they have a meeting, interview, work, group project, or other events that require them to come to campus? Or, what if they want to go work out at Eppley/Richie? They're paying for it as part of their tuition too.

Not sure if this is a DOTS decision, or if it's a directive from a higher-up. However, it is definitely apparent that the leadership of this school prioritizes football, and many other things, over the students who actually attend here. This is absolutely ridiculous, and needs to change. Regardless of who wins the football game, the students always lose here.

The value of quitting,97,13,"# The value of quitting

By Jason Filippou

As I’m sipping my iced coffee in the terrace of my dear friends’ beach house in Central Greece, quarter mile from the clear, calm waters of the Euboean Gulf, resting my weary legs that pedaled me back and forth on the surface of the sea not 10 minutes ago, not worried ***at all*** about conference and journal deadlines, it dawned on me how much of an outstanding ***career*** move it was to quit my PhD back in 2016. Not just a good idea in terms of [physical](https://jasonfil.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/the-3-year-long-health-saga-of-a-medically-insured-phd-student/) and mental health, but also in terms of actual career objectives.

But how can this possibly be? I quit, and **everybody** knows that quitters are the **worst** people in the world! Screw those guys!

So let’s compare and contrast my situation along some parameters to see how much I messed up my life by daring to quit.

* **Academic qualifications.** I had a Master’s, I have a Master’s. Nothing lost, nothing gained.
* **Computer Science qualifications.** Improved during PhD, *sky-rocketed* afterwards. During my grad coursework I learned some new programming languages and paradigms, linear and non-linear optimization and mostly stuff about Machine Learning that became obsolete by the time I had learned it (who cares about averaged perceptrons and kernelized SVMs anymore?). I was selected to do a PhD in Computer Vision merely because my Probabilistic Logic Programming system was applied on an antiquated video dataset (it could – in theory – be applied *anywhere* we have uncertain observations). Ergo, I was supposed to do a PhD in an area that I had absolutely nothing to do with, and no real desire to learn anything about. I was a logician who cared about stuff like Prolog, Markov Logic Networks and MaxWalkSat. The hell I had to do with log-concave densities and background subtraction? How long would it take me to learn the things I needed to *start* writing papers that *might* one day be *eligible* for publication in some second-tier Vision conference? On the other hand, during my time as a lecturer I’ve learned (and re-learned) elements of algorithms, coding principles, compilers, distributed systems, functional programming, even hardware! I’ve had top companies knock on my door to interview me for excellent positions in excellent places. When a student asks a question that I can’t answer in lecture, I don’t rest until I find an answer, which is **my own research**, under **my own terms**. During my PhD, I was a nobody in line to be Dr. Nobody, in a counter-productive environment where I was constantly feeling lost. Because I **was** lost.
* **Financials.** From one day to the next, I **quadrupled** my income. Started parking funds into a retirement account. Was able to move into my own place which, you know, is something that you might **need** as an adult / eligible bachelor at 30 years of age? I have some money to send back home since my parents won’t ever get pensions in the failed state of Greece. I bought a car. Adopted a kitty that I’m taking care of with toys, good food, frequent vet visits. Those things help my quality of life and allow me to be happier, better rested, generally more wholesome person.
* **Health**.
   * **Mental**: No, it hasn’t been easy. Managing hundreds of students and dozens of TAs is not something everyone can or is willing to do. Nobody trained me to do this. I was thrown into a Discrete Math class of 430 people, split across three lectures Tuesdays & Thursdays, left on my way. With vague expectations about the quality of education expected out of UMD, or what was expected off of me, an essentially foreign person who now had to teach people from all over the globe. It took its toll. But come December and May 20th, I turn a dial. No more worrying about papers and deadlines. No more useless meetings that lead nowhere. No more Skyping, fruitless collaborations, reviewing draft upon draft upon draft. Reading dozens of papers hoping that an idea will somehow come to my head. No sir / madam; if I run out of ideas / inspiration for assignments, there are books that I can consult. I have direction and help. Actual concrete direction and help.
   * **Physical**. Fact: in the US, if you’re outside NYC, you need a car. If you disagree, you’re **wrong**. No longer waiting on bus stops when it’s 90 degrees and ridiculously humid (that’s Maryland for you), or 10 degrees and… well, 10 degrees. No longer walking to the campus gym and back with my oversized rucksack under these conditions, making going to my workout…. a workout. In the car I go, toss the bag in the most geometrically obscene way possible, blast the A/C, hit my off-campus gym like a maniac, drive back in style. I have access to better food, with organic vegetables and fruits that actually taste like *something*. Because in this system and this country, a McDonald’s cheeseburger costs $1.50 and a Sweetgreen salad costs $10 (I wonder why there’s an obesity epidemic in low-income neighborhoods). I couldn’t even afford **looking** at those foods as a grad student. Now, on shopping days, I visit up to 3 different food stores to get what I need!
* **Professional** **status.** People are impressed by titles. I’m not, I don’t care at all (seriously, wtf is a “Solutions Architect?”), but people generally do. Whenever I’m asked what my job is, people think I’m a genius and published in every conference & journal there is. After a while, I stopped trying to convince them I’m not, and just smile and nod. Recruiter messages arrive at my inbox every day. When I was a graduate student, nobody cared. Of course, this has the benefit of not having to mark a ton of e-mail as “read” or avoiding awkward social encounters (*yeah… uh… you know… a lecturer is not a prof… I don’t do any research…. not a bigshot of any kind… uh…. nevermind*), but in the priority queue of problems, those are close to last.
* **Social life**. I have one!
* **Music**. Music and, in particular, the bass guitar, is important to me. A penniless graduate student can barely afford a Squier guitar and 50W practice amp. Also, the closest bass guitar lessons I could find are at a non-public-transportation distance from my area of work and (grad student – era) residence. It’s not that you *can’t* do it. You *can*. But after the umpteenth time that you get shat on by a pigeon waiting in the bus stop, or you get a nerve pulled trying to carry a 13lb 5-string Ibanez BTB in and out of the bus doors, well, that stuff wears you down, no matter what you want to do (exercise, music, anything). You want to maintain your passions without wasting time on useless procedural things (this is the chief reason I left Greece).
* **Actual free time**. **I’m the master of my post-5pm life**. This is **huge** to me. **I no longer have to worry about not worrying about research**. My goals are far more concrete, and I have a way of self-evaluating and evaluating my team. How did the students do in the midterm? They tanked it, you say? Well, is this perhaps on **me**? Did I perhaps assign a large point value to a problem the basics of which I didn’t cover well? Gotta curve appropriately. Did a TA or two fail to cover the same basics in their discussion sessions? Need to have a talk with those TAs. I have **actual**, **measurable** goals and concrete metrics / numbers that tell me how I’m doing. None of the haziness that I – honest a God -could not stand during my time in the PhD. *Is this how I’m supposed to approach this*… *is this actual Zero-Shot Learning… what do I need to know to do this…* No. Not for me, thank you very much. I need concrete, actionable feedback. Furthermore, it is up to **me** to do financial planning such that I **don’t** need to teach over the winter or the summer and I can go on trips instead! Yes, I could absolutely go ahead and sign up for a mortgage, but why? I don’t want to burden the next 15 years of my life with extra work so that I pay for a property I’m only likely to use as a financial commodity! My biggest financial commodity is my **healthy body and mind**. And why even enter the trouble of contacting appraisers, loan officers, property managers… I could give a crap about how sound of an investment it might be to own a house. It’s clear to me that nobody learned anything from 2008 and it’s gonna happen again and again and again. Why waste time being a cog in the machine when I could instead rent a cheap apartment in a non-gentrified area and eat an additional commute to work? After all, how bad is that commute when I listen to my favorite albums on the road every morning? I could give a crap about hardwood floors or laminated countertops. I can assure you my cat doesn’t care either. It only cares about being cute, eating and shitting. This isn’t Flip or Flop; it’s my life, and it’s ending one second at a time. The most sound investment I can make is **to not make unsound investments** and instead park money in retirement accounts for when I’m too weak to work (if I’m lucky enough to reach that age).

The majority of the 3 people who will read this post will undoubtedly go ahead and quit their jobs / marriages / whatever they think makes them sad, hoping that they are no longer sad, and once they realize nothing’s changed, they will wonder what that inflated bag of douche was saying on the internet and rage. This is of course **not** the essence of this post. The essence is that this whole “never quit” business can sometimes be **lip service**. Sometimes, the best thing to do is **quit**. Maybe the goal was BS from the beginning, or maybe the investment is no longer worth it. Maybe you’ve unearthed an alternative path in your pursuit of a goal that doesn’t seem that interesting anymore. In fact, this was another one of my own reasons. I can’t even describe how much more satisfying teaching is for me when compared to research.

**But it’s not for everyone**. Not everyone can quit. Especially when quitting means betraying all that you thought you were or you were gonna be, and also endangers the immigration status that is keeping you away from your home country which is enmeshed in a web of decades-long socio-economic fail. It takes **courage** to quit, and not everyone can do it.

Housing for prospective student,2,5,"I applied to UBC (first year international undergrad) and so now just in the waiting period of sending documents/waiting for a decision haha
I submitted my housing app, and I applied to YRH. I know the first year residences are orchard/vanier/... 
when I applied for housing those weren’t among my choices, so I listed exchange, Iona, marine and ponderosa. 
I checked the status and I’m waitlisted as exchange 1711, Iona 1701, marine 3511, and ponderosa 4244. 
Is housing for first years completely guaranteed as long as submitted by the deadline? I’m not too knowledgeable about housing applications, lol

Prospective Student Housing Question,1,3,"I am an Alberta student who has applied to UBC for my third year. I’ve applied to September-April housing for 2020/2021 and I have just found out about Year-Round Housing. To my understanding (correct me if I’m wrong), those who apply to YRH have a better chance at getting their preferred choice of residence. Since I’m hoping for no roommates (a studio or a 1BDRM), I’m wondering if I should apply for YRH even though I most likely wouldn’t be able to move in on May 1st? I understand that subletting is a thing, but I’m still not 100% sure how it all works. For those of you who have applied for YRH and have subletted before, would you recommend it for someone who has no experience living away from home? What have your experiences with YRH been like and is it worth it? 
Please let me know if I need to further clarify anything and forgive me if this question has been answered before.",e7kc9i,UBC

UBC housing termination fee,4,10,"I am a coop student trying to cancel my year round housing contract and my contract termination fee is going to be $2800.

Backstory

In September, I had submitted a cancellation request to Housing, and the termination fee was assessed at $950, my deposit to not be refunded and held. The place I was interested in moving to did not work out, I wasn’t able to get in on it fast enough due to trying to sort out my UBC contract cancellation. As such, I withdrew my cancellation request, no issues with Housing.

A month later, October, now, my partner is offered a 1 bedroom place on campus.  They have 24hrs to make a decision. It is a surprise offer, we had forgotten the transfer request he submitted. To move in together, I will have to cancel my contract, and so I submit my contract cancellation request a second time. This time, I am told it is a late request and will be charges 25% of yearly rent. I am aware this clause in the contract, but as a coop student I assumed this would hopefully waived but at the very least reduced, to around $950 or so, as had been assessed a month ago. My newly assessed termination fee is $2800. This is obviously a lot of money, close to 3 months rent. 

Although I do not know the inner workings of Housing operations, I find it hard to believe that my current unit will not be immediately snapped up but those on the housing wait list. 

Question for reddit: do I have reason enough to respond to Housing querying why the termination fee has increased so much a month later, keeping in mind that both requests and subsequent fee assessments, were submitted well after the June 30 deadline, yet only this October current request is considered, in their words, late? $2800 is a huge amount of money, not that $950 is paltry either. 

I am a Masters student on coop in Vancouver, working long hours, losing sleep at the thought of handing over so much money. 

TLDR
Second time attempting to cancel year round Housing contract - first time $950, this time $2800 termination fee. Coop student, circumstances the same.

UPDATE: thanks for all the helpful input! I’ve written to Housing, not getting my hopes up for a reduction but maybe some peace of mind.",dfuu5s,UBC

"UBC students move into campus housing as demand hits all-time high. Six thousand people are on the waitlist this year, hoping for a residency to open up at some point in the weeks and months ahead.

"Rant: Housing is a massive issue, from the fact Wesbrook exists to people making money off other students",18,19,"I just need to get this out of my system. Maybe I'm just overly disgruntled, but UBC has a massive issue with housing.

First of all if you're a poor soul who didn't make it into Year-Round housing or winter session, it sucks. I normally would just accept it because sometimes the luck of the draw isn't in your favour. However, what really bothers the shit out of me is when those who are lucky enough to get a place with UBC Housing, sublet their place for astronomically higher prices and essentially make money off other unlucky students. For example, I have seen studios which are normally $1200, have a starting ask of $1500, to almost $2000!!! AND THEY GET SOLD, because we unfortunate souls are that desperate.

UBC Housing needs to step in \^ for situations like this, because if they can control all the admin key and stuff, they should control the prices. Literally a simple pay UBC housing directly would fix this, or have some kind of repercussion if students are taking advantage. I emailed them about this and they literally said it's up to the subletter. It just seems so unethical to make money off your fellow student.

Secondly, UBC knows we have this housing crisis. They cannot keep up with the demand. So why is the UBC Properties Trust a thing? I understand their mandate is to generate revenue so it can fuel UBC, but if any of those beautiful buildings in wesbrook were to enter the UBC Housing, suddenly the crisis wouldn't be so bad. OR any of those prime locations near Gage!

I just hope I'm not alone in the frustration. I'm also very open to someone telling me why UBC Properties Trust is a thing. Sincerely,

:( person who is desperate for housing

Housing-related questions posted anywhere else will be removed.

A couple of notes: 

* Please provide us with as much *pertinent* information as possible. If you don't know what to put in a certain field of your application, take a screenshot of the application, but we probably don't need to know what program you're in - unless it has a non-standard start/end date. 
* Everyone is always more helpful when it seems like you've already tried to solve your problem. Try to answer your own questions, first, and then tell us what you did. 
* Housing processes change every year, and nobody here works for UBC (unless they state otherwise and are moderator-verified). 
* Try to ask several small questions instead of one big one. For example, don't ask if you should apply for residence - that's totally subjective. Ask specific questions you have about residence which can be answered conclusively, and draw your own conclusions from the responses you get. 
* Remember that everyone is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. 
* Upvote good answers: saying 'thanks' is nice, but if someone helped you out, upvotes will make the information more visible to everyone. 
* **Important:** Do not PM people asking for advice. PMs are both annoying, and you're the only one who can see the answer you get. Post it here in the megathread where others can see it, and apply it to their situation as is relevant.
* **Important:** Please keep in mind that it's been a minimum of a year since most of us have done anything related to housing. You're going to need to jog our memories if you have questions about anything specific - what you're trying to figure out might not have even been possible last year. Anonymized screenshots or the exact wording and context of the question will help you get better answers.

She goes to these people saying basically the same thing. That shes an international student supporting herself while attending school full time. She works 50-hours a week to pay for school and living costs. That on top of that she might not have housing come September, and she never asked these people to solve her issues, just to help in ways they have the power to. I don't know the point of this post, part of me wants to showcase how little support is shown to struggling students and I guess a part of me wants to see if any of you know of any other options she could explore. A lot of her problems would go be so much easier if she had secured on-campus housing for September (she works 3 jobs on campus starting at 5am and doesnt come home until 12am), but as it stands shes #79 for Frasier Hall and #102 for Thunderbird 4.  She's contacted her ESP, International advising, housing, and goes to counselling. What else is there to do?",coy3n9,UBC

##**Carpool Thread**
As everyone is aware, transit workers have served 72 hour strike notice, to commence a strike starting midnight at Halloween (00:00, Nov 1).  We have asked UBC administration if there is a plan in place for this event, and last we heard, there is no plan.

We would like to urge all clubs to please help organize carpool arrangements within your clubs.  As large groups of people who presumably know each other, clubs are uniquely suited to help their members get to school if the worst happens. 

**You can use this thread to find passengers and drivers for a carpool.** Please include:

- Are you a driver or a passenger?

- A nearby community center or other public space you can get picked up/pick people at

- The time you need to get to campus by

- The general time-frame of your commute

- Other information relevant to passengers

**Be sure you get picked up/dropped off at a public location, only get picked up by people you’ve talked to in advance (preferably those who are UBC students or staff), share your travel information with friends, and always use your best judgment.**

What the hell is up with this school?,338,92,"Excuse the rant.

&#x200B;

I'm a first year that moved from somewhere else in BC. Currently I live in one of the old Totem Park houses. My experience with residence at UBC so far has been terrible, especially considering the amount of money that I've paid. I'm only a week in, and I hope to god it gets better because I'm going to be spending the rest of the year here.

First, let's talk about the meal plan for first years. This is a well-known topic but the meal plan is a money-grubbing monopoly at best and a downright scam at worst. I went to FEAST at totem the other day and tried to buy a yogurt parfait that was about half the height of my hand. It was $6.50. My high school cafetaria had a bigger yogurt parfait with more toppings at $2.

Not to mention the amount of food you get. You ever go to Orchard's open kitchen and order the Kung Pao or Chicken and they give you one of these bowls that's not even 1/4th full? It's $10 worth of food that's meant to feed hungry teenagers, many of which could be athletes, or frequently walking/studying. I consider myself on the smaller side in terms of weight/height and it barely keeps me full.

The entire payment scheme is disgusting. Residence dining halls like to advertise saying that you get a 25% discount off the regular price which is true, but you literally pay for that discount. It's called ""residence overhead"" and you pay $1,000 for the year. Discount my ass, what kind of discount makes you pay for the discount ahead of time? Oh, and you lose that discount if you don't spend it at your dining hall. The discount you already paid for in advance. I was making some small talk with one of the guys at the office in FEAST and when I mentioned this he just shrugged and said ""I don't make the decisions."" Even the staff know it's terrible.

The UBC website says that first years pay $5500 for the meal plan. That's for around seven months of eating assuming you move out for winter break. That's $785 a MONTH. Do you think teenagers fresh out of high school can feasibly afford that? It doesn't matter through, UBC gets off on the government's dime.

And the worst part? It's not even nutritious. The Pork Mannoush at feast has something like 2400mg's of sodium and that's only one meal. Pretty much everything worthwhile on a cost/calorie basis is fried and soaked in fat. You can go to the salad or fruit bar but in terms of calories its pretty much impossible to get enough energy to function on a daily basis, eat healthy AND not run out of meal plan money at the same time.

It's sad that Domino's Pizza is the best deal for food in terms of meal plan. You know what makes it even worse? Domino's isn't even in campus. Out of all the eateries, the most cost-effective option is a pizza delivery from Vancouver. Seriously?

This scam is mandatory for first years. 18-year olds who barely have any sort of financial resources. Sure you can be reasonably middle class or well off and expect your parents to pay for it. But what about the kids without those sort of resources? Take out a loan or starve. You can look at pretty much any other post-secondary institution in Canada and they have it better. This is a frequent complaint too. A year or two back there was a petition on [change.org](https://change.org) with somewhere around a thousand signatures and they did jack shit. In fact, they upped the prices.

Not to mention the wi-fi. The wi-fi at my dorm is absolutely terrible. Speedtest has it average at like 2-3 mbits download and 3-4 mbits upload. I can't do coursework in my dorm since the connection goes on-off-on-off like the lights at a drunk frat party. I'm paying something like $10,000 to live here for seven months, is decent wi-fi too much to ask? I'm not wanting to stream 1080P blu-rays or anything, just let me watch my goddamn math prelectures on youtube without jizzing out.

And the cherry on top? They make you pay for laundry. By god, haven't you made enough money off of us? At least let us do the bloody laundry for free. And the driers suck shit too. It took me five dries the first time I did laundry to actually get my clothes to a reasonable moisture-free level. And it was still fucking damp. It cost me $10 to do one load of laundry.

I went to the first-year pep rally and they were talking about how this is the school of the future that's incorporating technology into the curriculum. Technology my ass I'd rather go study in cambodia if it means I get decent wifi.

2. How likely is it that I'll get a place? Shall I look for other on-campus housing? ([https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/other-housing/more-campus-housing/](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/other-housing/more-campus-housing/))
3. Or wait for their decision?

HOUSING MEGATHREAD (2018W): Questions related to having a roof over your head go here.,23,700,"## The housing megathread isn't just for incoming students, or people looking to live on-campus. If you're asking about anything related to living somewhere while you're a student at UBC, it belongs here. 

#### Disclaimer: while there are year-to-year trends, they're not guarantees. We strongly encourage you to contact the relevant non-reddit bodies (the UBC Housing office, your prospective landlord, the Residential Tenancy board) to confirm any answers you get here. 

Housing-related questions posted anywhere else will be removed.

A couple of notes: 

* Please provide us with as much *pertinent* information as possible. If you don't know what to put in a certain field of your application, take a screenshot of the application, but we probably don't need to know what program you're in - unless it has a non-standard start/end date. 
* Everyone is always more helpful when it seems like you've already tried to solve your problem. Try to answer your own questions, first, and then tell us what you did. 
* Housing processes change every year, and nobody here works for UBC (unless they state otherwise and are moderator-verified). 
* Try to ask several small questions instead of one big one. For example, don't ask if you should apply for residence - that's totally subjective. Ask specific questions you have about residence which can be answered conclusively, and draw your own conclusions from the responses you get. 
* Remember that everyone is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. 
* Upvote good answers: saying 'thanks' is nice, but if someone helped you out, upvotes will make the information more visible to everyone. 
* **Important:** Do not PM people asking for advice. PMs are both annoying, and you're the only one who can see the answer you get. Post it here in the megathread where others can see it, and apply it to their situation as is relevant.
* **Important:** Please keep in mind that it's been a minimum of a year since most of us have done anything related to housing. You're going to need to jog our memories if you have questions about anything specific - what you're trying to figure out might not have even been possible last year. Anonymized screenshots or the exact wording and context of the question will help you get better answers.

Don’t join Science Co-op,12,9,"I have had a horrible experience with Science co-op and I would like to hear your guys’ thought on this. 

First off, the program provides resume reviews and mock interviews, both of which are not a super special service considering how much they charge you. 

Second, they have a job database specifically for students. However, I, and a lot of my friends found jobs outside of the database. Not just this, but science co-op makes you do an application package that consists of a summary sheet, resume, cover letter, and transcript, whereas in a lot of other locations, a simple resume is enough. 

Third, they charge you so much tuition for all of the above (and I know UBC is notorious for charging every penny but co-op is optional, so I would just like to point that out). 

Fourth, they make you do a stupid end of term assignment and if you just went and found a job on your own, you wouldn’t have to do any assignment for marks. 

Fifth, the credits you get from co-op don’t even count towards graduation. 

I had joined science co-op because I was afraid of not being able to find my first job and science co-op boasted a 99% placement rate. However, I ended up finding a job on my own anyway and science co-op was completely useless to me and a waste of money. I quit science co-op now. I understand the fear of not landing a job, but there are plenty of other websites and resources you can use for a lot less money. You won’t even need to attend science co-op’s mandatory workshops (which also proved useless to me)",doijel,UBC

Would I have a chance of getting housing for 2019-2020? If not, I've also applied for winter housing but I'm not sure how that works, and I applied after they did the lottery so will I even get it?

Year Round Housing anxiety,4,11,"Hi all. Deeply distressed first year here. Can't believe I'm still alive, to tell you the truth. Still struggling more and more everyday but one endures. Anyways, I'll cut straight to the chase.

*Some background info, don't know if it's relevant:* I've referred to that very handy YRH chances table but some further corroboration would be appreciated. I applied for YRH early to mid September-ish (it was a bad time mental-health wise hence the late application). I'm an international student on res atm. I am supposed to go back to my home country for the summer but I would like to spend May here working and go back in June. It is all dependent on YRH though. So I won't be in Canada from May to August. Haven't been able to seriously start looking for a place yet for August because I have no idea if YRH is going to work out.

**So what are my chances of getting an offer for May 1? (!!) My numbers and preferences right now are as follows --**

Thunderbird 4 -- 365

Marine 3/4 -- 815

Brock 4 -- 714

Pond 4 -- 904

Fraser Hall 6 -- 399

In addition, my roommate group of 4 was finalized rather recently (like Friday recently). Does that affect my or their chances at getting YRH? They applied around the same time I did, and their numbers are fairly similar for Thunderbird and Marine (mine might be lower though). Do we have any chance at all for getting housing together for May? By what exact date should I consider YRH a lost cause (in that no offer is received by then) and start viewing (and not just considering) off campus housing in person?

So sorry if I didn't make sense and I apologize for the English. Stressful time. Overly-caffeinated and averaging a breakdown a day. Hope your day is going well! Thank you for all and any help, immensely appreciated.",b2q9ax,UBC

[OPINION] Housing Living Standards,22,17,"[Current Apartment. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/mn4lXQZ)

Hello, I just wanted to voice my concern and ask if this living standard is actually OK.
I’ve just moved into dorms less than a week ago, and when I moved in, me and the friend that helped out were so shocked to see the apartment. When we entered, there was an awful smell (still have) and I couldn’t stay any longer there. The floor was REALLY dirty, and what amazes me that this apartment is a shared four bedroom with 3 other GIRLS! 
I’ve been thinking the whole time, is this common? How can people live in such a mess? I’m really uncomfortable to the point that I have to shower EVERYDAY at my friend’s place because there is blood inside the box and a spider living there! I was always taught to clean up my own mess and to not bother other people or making them feel uncomfy, but also, I always lived in a clean place because this is what my parents taught me! 
Since I’ve arrived, I’ve been eating out everyday, spending way more money because I don’t have a place to cook, I’m not even home except for sleep. Since I’ve arrived, I didn’t touch ANYTHING except for the bathroom. I still haven’t unpacked my boxes and luggage in hope of getting moved out ASAP. 
I’ve applied for a room transfer and emailed RLM, but I’m getting anxious because I have an incoming midterm in exactly 1 week. And RLM is taking so long to reply me even thought I’ve walked to the office and talked very briefly about my situation. I am also feeling the whole situation is unfair because I am paying so much for food, room transfer fee, for a bedroom that I only go back to sleep and a place that I never used.

EDIT: Hey guys, thank you for hearing me out! After a few days they transferred me to another apartment, and my roomies are so much nicer and they welcomed me  very well! I appreciated reading your comments and followed some tips and I’m glad that it worked. ",agljwc,UBC
Frats: A Discussion,1,26,"Good Afternoon.

TL;DR - What do you think about Greek life at UBC? Would you advocate for the removal of the greek housing on (near) campus? Would you argue that the fraternities should be allowed to hold events in the greek housing?

Opinion: 

At the start of my undergrad, I considered Greek life at UBC to be tolerable and almost like a watered-down version of the Greek life I had been exposed to in the United States. However, as I spent more time here, I started to question the value of Greek life to UBC. Greek life is historically (and to an extent still is) an institution that has classist, sexist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic ideologies. Although these issues are most commonly associated with the massive brother and sisterhoods in the United States, the embodiment of these values on campus by frats and sororities can not be overlooked.

Greek life has also acted as a movement of good, through the creation of a community for students who are like-minded, connecting and establishing new relationships. The ""center"" of Greek life though is arguably the most beneficial aspect to society as well: Philanthropy.

However, time and time again most university students in North America have bared witness to the negative repercussions of the existence of these communities. The undeniable persistence of rape culture in fraternities is probably the strongest argument for the removal of fraternities at UBC. The few who benefit from the existence of Greek life pail in comparison to the number who endure the consequences and have to tolerate the behaviour of the individuals who give Greek life a bad reputation.

So basically, for the preference part, I have nearly zero experience of living with strangers, so I'm kinda hesitated about choosing shared rooms. And for the most part, I like live and study alone. What's your advices about this? 

Also, which place do you think is the best (living and adapting friendly) to a first-year student, who don't have the budget to live in the most luxurious room but also want to live in a decent and comfortable place (I believe I would still prefer living alone if the price difference between shared room is not that high).

Last but not least, for the meal plans, are they extra fees other than the residence fee or are they inclusive? And, is there a choice for the mandatory meal plan (to not invest too much money into the plan)?

"I'm Austen Erhardt, an independent federal election candidate for Vancouver Quadra. Ask me anything!",21,15,"Hi /r/UBC!

My name is Austen Erhardt. I’m an engagement and communication consultant — and 2016 UBC political science grad — who is running as an independent to become Vancouver Quadra’s next Member of Parliament. 

This evening, UBC’s Alma Mater Society is co-hosting two ‘all-candidates debates’ — including one of the 100 Debates on the Environment. They have decided that I will not be permitted to participate in the debates, as they are only allowing candidates from the ‘four major parties’. 

Having meaningful conversations with UBC students is very important to me, so I’m hosting an AMA this evening as an alternative. In addition to answering your questions, I will respond to questions posed to my fellow candidates at the debates (pulled from Twitter). 

My platform is focused around four key areas:

Meaningful climate action — including the expansion of emissions pricing, the creation of a permanent federal transit fund, investing in sustainable technologies and industries, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. I’m firmly opposed to the expansion of the TransMountain pipeline. 

Public health — with a focus on preventative care, mental health coverage and universal Pharmacare, supporting a renewal of Canada’s public health systems. This also includes combatting the opioid crisis by funding public addictions treatment facilities and mental health services. 

Affordability — focusing on affordable housing with funding for federally owned rentals and advocacy for moderate-density zoning throughout key areas of Vancouver Quadra (‘four floors and corner stores’).

Education — eliminating interest on federal student loans and increasing funding availability for lower-income students (in part by re-allocating RESP matching funding, which disproportionately benefits wealthier families and students).

Other priorities include electoral reform, progressive taxation and supporting provincial efforts to crack down on money laundering. You can view my campaign Facebook page here: [https://www.facebook.com/aeformp](https://www.facebook.com/aeformp).

Grad student housing - best time to apply,3,9,"Hello everyone,

Hopefully you all had a great start to the new year. 

I'm a prospective grad student (over 25, married, international, never been to Vancouver).
I applied to UBC due to match with program, however it's quite competitive and I am not that sure I'll be admitted.

I noticed on this sub that everyone advises applying early for campus housing, but I don't want to waste the application fees if it's not that necessary. Historically, this particular program sends admission responses at the end of March. 

Should I bite the bullet and apply now? (We would prefer a 1 bedroom) or just wait for admission outcome and apply in April?

Incoming Exchange Student - Looking for advice about housing,3,8,"Hi!

I'm an Aussie exchange student coming in for the Winter & Spring Quarters, and I've been having some trouble with deciding what to do about housing.

For starters, I'm 20 (turning 21 in 2020), and I've heard that most of the residence halls are for freshman/sophomores. On the other hand, the apartments seem to be pretty far from campus and that seems a bit bothersome, as well as socially isolating. Staying in off-campus accom is also an option but I know very little about that.

So I guess my questions boil down to:

1. What do other juniors do? Do they go off campus or stay in apartments? And do people still bother socialising outside of their circles? I guess this question would be summed up as, where would I fit in best?
2. For those of you who are international, what do you do? where do you stay/who do you socialise with?
3. How well integrated is the community? Do people go into IV to party or do they stay in their areas?
4. Do people make friends through clubs or do they tend to focus on flatmates/frats etc. (speaking of frats are they a thing?)
5. Lastly, how do those of you living in apartments find the experience? Did you already have a well-built social network when you moved there? How difficult is it to get to campu?

Overall I guess my main concern is where I can go to fit into the community and integrate, rather than being isolated.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

I usually wouldn’t make a post like this, but I ordered some parts for my means of transportation that has been out of commission. Now I have to wait a whole other week to get in contact with the retailer because no one local here sells the parts. UGH

**EDIT:** The 3-strike system is so FLAWED also. As someone previously mentioned in the comments, some retailers and sites won’t even allow you to type “PO BOX” in the address option and you’ll have to use your dorm or apt.number.

You get a WARNING the first time your package isn’t addressed to the PO BOX. And then two more strikes after that. THEN , they’ll just start sending your packages back to sender! 

like TF is that shit. Y’all have my package in hand, YOU KNOW that I’m here at UCSB, but instead of contacting me you’ll return to sender. ok imig",dd1qr7,UCSantaBarbara

Co-op Housing

and just general Housing in the Isla Vista neighbourhood. I have joined the fb groups for housing, but I am not sure which option would suit me best.  


In general, I would prefer my housing to be **as social as possible**, or to open me to many social opportunities (e.g. cool people to hang out with, parties, etc). In Australia, I commute for an hour to get to my campus, so really just looking for an experience where I can be in the midst of things socially where I live.

Financially, I don't mid spending a little bit more if that is necessary, as I currently save quite a lot.

International Student Housing,3,1,"Edit: Title should say Exchange*, I fucked that up

Hey everyone, hope this post gets through during the second act of the mountain lion fiasco, but I have a question or 2.

I'm a gaucho myself and I'm currently on my semester abroad in Sweden, but I have a friend here who is wanting to study abroad in CA and is stoked on UCSB! She hasn't applied yet and therefore hasn't been accepted but I've been trying to help her figure out the process, and the main issue is housing. For reference, she'd be staying the whole year, Fall 2020 to Spring 2021.

I told her about possible subleasers, but we were wondering if it would be more convenient to find a permanent place for the whole year instead of swapping houses/subleases each quarter. I also told her to check out the Free& For Sale page on Facebook for this as well.

She could possibly try and join a full lease with some people, but we weren't sure if that would be possible, as she'd still be in Sweden during the time where you'd normally be signing a lease, so I'm not sure how feasible that would be.

There's also student apartments, but I know nothing about those, so if any of you know anything I'd appreciate the info. Same goes for the housing cooperatives, I know nothing.

Are there any other options I'm forgetting? I think she'd prefer to live in Isla Vista than Goleta proper but I'm sure that's an option too.

Support striking grad students at UC Santa Cruz,136,19,"As some of you may or may not know, TAs at UC Santa Cruz are going on strike to demand a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). UCSC grad students are currently severely rent-burdened, meaning they spend 50-60% or more of their wages from the university on rent alone. This does not include other basic needs like food; at the rate they are currently compensated by the university, it is simply not a livable wage.

Late Cal Grant A & Housing Payment,0,2,"First post here, incoming freshman, hi folks. I called up finaid since my Cal Grant A wasn't showing up on BARC and finaid said to just hold tight and wait for it to kick in. I was already given a deadline extension to pay off my tuition and such, and I have it paid off with just loans (Parent PLUS and direct), still waiting for Cal Grant.

I acknowledge the fact that I will be refunded whatever loans are left over after my Cal Grant is officially dispersed in BARC, however, since I am dorming at Tropicana Del Norte (TDN), my housing payment process in general is different than a dorm within UCSB (from what I understand). I am required to have $0 balance for TDN by the 22nd for move-in, and overall payment deadline is October 1st. 

My situation is that I am relying on most of my PLUS loan to pay off housing, however it's currently being used to pay off my tuition and other fees due to the late Cal Grant.

Why don't people complain about the gentrification of IV?,82,88,"The other day I was talking to my barber who was raised in IV. He was raised by Mexican immigrants in a low income household. Him and his family had to move out a few years ago because it was too expensive to live in IV any longer. 


I did some research on Wikipedia and found this quote as well, to add to the timeline:


>Starting in the 1970s, Isla Vista became more and more dominated by students from UCSB and nearby Santa Barbara City College. As UCSB grew and expanded its enrollment, the economic power of the relatively affluent students drove non-student residents out. The late 1960s upheaval destroyed a raft of organized activities that once occupied students' time, and into the void a free-form party scene took hold, resulting in throngs of young people gathering on Friday and Saturday nights on Del Playa Drive, the street that hugs the southern blufftop of Isla Vista.


So basically low income native Isla Vista residents were kicked out of Isla Vista so that upper middle class kids could have a dedicated place to party. SBCC students are arguably the worst, since they don't even have the excuse of it being so close by.


I know that UCSB is a very liberal school, and many people here have problems with gentrification in cities like Los Angeles and Brooklyn, but I find it ironic/hypocritical that they are part of the problem pricing out actual Isla Vista/Goleta natives.

We think we'll be able to make it fine since she would be university employed, and my job is moveable. We have seen that there are a few faculty housing campuses for rent or purchase, but without a login, we can really only see the rates for the now sold out Ocean Walk community. Can anyone here tell me what the faculty rental units run, or point me to more information beyond what I can find on UCSB's housing site, since the info there is pretty limited. 

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: thanks for all the replies both here and in my inbox. Think I've got all the info I need at this point if anyone else stumbles upon this.",aibguh,UCSantaBarbara

Info on Tropicana Del Norte as an exchange student?,1,7,"Hi everyone,

I'm an incoming UCSB exchange student for the winter and spring quarters, and I'm trying to decide on housing. I've been offered a spot in tropicana del norte by the university, and I was wondering if anyone had any information on what this residence hall is like? Particularly as an exchange student, what would my experience be like? Note that I'm 20 years old, so a junior by American standards.

Would I be better off organising off-campus housing?

I read that the make-up of Tropicana del norte is mostly 1st and 2nd years, but it's seperate from the rest of the halls - how does it differ?

I'd love to get some advice from you guys! Thanks in advance",e3mtzd,UCSantaBarbara

"Affordable housing and cooperative living, available at Montie House (mod approved)",10,12,"Hey r/MSU, I'm the membership chair at Montie Cooperative House, and we're currently looking for new members!    

If you don't know what a cooperative house is, it's basically a huge coed house where everybody rents out rooms, and work is distributed evenly among the house mates. And Montie is a big house; 3 floors and a basement, with 23 rooms. But it's really more than that; it's having a social circle where something is CONSTANTLY going on, whether we're throwing a party or just hanging out playing videogames. You're also getting plugged into the network of other coops who are partying or chilling. It's kind of like a fraternity in that regard, but without all the extra money and weird shit.

Montie is run democratically, with all housemates having a vote on big ticket issues that come up at our monthly meetings. There's an electorial board, with positions like house manager, treasurer, social, memberhsip, etc. which your work will count towards your rent. You can also do chores which count towards rent.    

Speaking of rent, it's $350 a month for a single room, and $300 for a shared double. Keep in mind, right now we have a lot of open rooms but once they fill up people may need to double based on seniority. There's also a $400 security deposit.    

We have a ton of amenities, including 2 washers and dryers, Wi-Fi and a loaded up entertainment room, a parking lot with a fair number of spots, indoor bike storage, a commercial kitchen and basic food staples, and it's also really close to campus. Gas, water, and electric are also included in the rent.

Terminating MSU housing contract without paying 60%,7,7,"I’m currently a 19 year old sophomore (junior by credits) at MSU. I signed the residence hall housing contract back in October 2018 but I have several reasons for wanting to now terminate my contract for the 2019-2020 year. MSU’s policy around terminating a contract after 14 days requires that you pay 60% of the total yearly cost unless you have valid reasons for termination, which I want to avoid doing at all costs since some of my reasons are financial.  First, I had a very bad experience with my roommate my freshman year and I ended up staying at my boyfriends apartment the majority of the year. She stole several things from me and I have a large amount of anxiety around getting a new roommate. In general, I have bad anxiety and I could probably get a doctors note recommending alternative housing. Second, I want to officially move in with my boyfriend of 4 years. Since I practically lived with him my entire freshman year, and I have been living with him all summer (good job in East Lansing), nothing would change by “moving in” with him except permanently changing my address. Not only would this be good for mental health reasons, but also it makes a ton of sense financially and would save me thousands. I would be paying significantly less for housing and food costs and wouldn’t have to worry about loan interest as a loan wouldn’t be necessary. My mom suggested that I legally change my address to my boyfriend’s and request termination due to a change in housing but I’m worried I will still be required to pay the 60%. I am entirely financially independent from my parents, besides my $70 car insurance that they pay for for me. My job situation hasn’t changed since I signed the contract. I am also considering simply not moving in if I can’t get out of the housing contract, and continuing to live with my boyfriend and pay rent however this is not financially ideal but again, I am having a lot of anxiety around the idea of going back to the dorms. With all of this considered, and the strictness of MSU’s termination policy, is the any feasible way I can terminate my contract without paying the 60%? What’s my best shot? Any advise?",cfzlj7,msu

Beware of MSU sororities: living in house horror stories and other information,157,46,"I know reddit is not the most popular place for future Greek life students. I’m writing this on the off chance anyone was thinking of joining a sorority and stumbles across this. As a sister in a sorority, PLEASE read this if this applies to you. I’m not telling you not to join, if that’s what you really want, but read everything so you can be fully informed. 


In the beginning, there is so much information thrown at you. There are adults, alums of the sorority, that help the girls talk to you about everything. They’ll talk to you and your parents, and everything will seem alright. They are so kind and accommodating to you and your parents. They’ll let your parents email and text them every question they could ever have. You have the feeling of, “wow. This is why they said welcome home!” That feeling is the best. 

Part of being in a sorority is the obligation to live-in. When you’re a new member, a “baby”, you sign a contract. Part of is member requirements. Member requirements includes making sure every bed in the house is full, every year. Most sororities have a mandatory live-in clause. Regardless of where you want to live, you HAVE to live in the house. 

Living in the house seems like a dream. It’s a HUGE house, you get to live with 50 of your friends, there’s staff that runs the house, and scheduled activities. If nothing bad happens in your life, it might not be the worst living situation. Seriously overpriced, no privacy, and constant drama, but it could be worse. 

But what if something goes wrong? The 50+ girls in the house plus the other sisters will support you, right? They’ll understand if you need to move away from the house, whether it be to an apartment or back home, right? 

The answer is no. It does not matter if you were sexually assaulted, paralyzed, going through chemo, or if you had to drop out of school to care for a newly disabled family member. No one will care. They will blacklist you. No one will check on you, everyone will drop you from their social circles, and you will still be stuck paying $8,000 for a place you can no longer live. 

There’s nothing you can do. None of the “leases” for the house are leases- it’s a CONTRACT. It doesn’t follow the rules and laws of a lease. You can’t break it, no matter how hard, or for how long, you try. 

But on top of all of this, you lose everything you’ve spent time working for. You lose your sisters, the standing you had in your house, and all your social activities. Most people have a few friends here and there outside of their sorority, but they’re not that close. They know of other activities, but they spent more time on the sorority. It would be like having the entire world yanked from under your feet. Not only would you be dealing with a tragedy, but you also lost the only support system you knew at college. 

If you really, REALLY, want to join a sorority, like I did, you still can. That’s a 100% personal decision between you and your parents. But know that no matter how close you seem with everyone, if things go bad they will leave. When people say when you’re in a sorority, you’re just paying for friends, it is 100% accurate. You are paying for friends, parties, and social activities. The second you stop paying- for any portion of anything- those things immediately stop. No exceptions.",cl7rq1,msu

Struggling with Deciding on Housing (incoming freshman),3,17,"I've decided I want to attend MSU, but something that I've had a hard time gauging is which dorm would best fit me.

The only real criteria I have used would be whether or not the dorm has community bathrooms or not (I want community bathrooms), along with bits of information on the dorms that I could find on the internet.

For reference, I can choose from Bryan, Case, Holmes, Mason, McDonel, Snyder-Phillips or Yakeley-Gilchrist (I'm going to be doing the honors college as it seems like the only way I'll be able to properly afford to attend).

The 3 that stand out to me out of those based on the little research I've done would be Bryan, Gilchrist, and Mason, but I really don't have much to go off of.

Some basic info to go off of:

* I don't mind location relative to classes, as I want to get more exercise biking and what-not.
* I suppose good internet would be important to me, but it isn't too significant.
* I'm more of an introverted person who doesn't really plan on partying all that much, I'm moreso going to try to make some close friends, join rec sports, and join social clubs.
* Cafeteria quality doesn't stand out as something that I want to highly prioritize, but it holds some importance I guess.
* My major right now is pretty TBD, but right now I think I want to teach English abroad in Japan as that seems like it'd be more fulfilling than a desk job, but I also am grounded in Finance just in case my plans change, as it seems overall useful (if any of this might affect dorm situation)
* EDIT: the larger the dorm the better for me, holds decent significance.

If me answering any questions would be helpful I'd be more than happy to answer anything, as any help would be really appreciated.

1999 Sexual assault,144,17,"I was drugged and gang raped in 1999 at MSU. I had a rape kit done at Olin but they never found the perpetrators.

I recently bought a house in East Lansing and even though all of this was buried in my mind, since living here again it has come to the forefront and bothers me all of the time. I never alerted Olin or MSU of my different addresses throughout the years. Would it be worth it to go to someone and ask if the DNA from my kit had ever been cross referenced now that technology is much better? I don't think I could have any justice done because of the statute of limitations, but if any of these men hurt someone else, would they be able to use evidence from my assault to help show a serial pattern?

I am coming back to MSU next semester and was wondering what the possibility of me being able to get into University Village/ 1855 place would be. I know that they get full fast when people sign up for housing the year before. But, I was wondering maybe it would be possible if I could get into a 4 bedroom if someone had left the apartment. And, for University Village do you have to pay MSU housing the first month's rent a week after signing the housing contract?

Life Tip,0,47,"So this is a fact that you won't notice right away but anyone older can see instantly. You aren't on a sleep over. What this means is that it's now time for you to act like an adult. You don't live at home anymore but that doesn't mean because you're away from your parents that you need to go party every weekend, get drunk every night, and not take care of yourself. If you're suddenly sick and you don't know why, you need to buy medicine. Is the internet down? Maybe you need to stop relying on a internet that's being used by every student in the dorm and instead should purchase your own internet. You know that dorm room you're staying in? That's not your bedroom but is instead your home. You need to lock the door to your house and bring your keys with you, so why wouldn't you do the same here?  


Do you get what I'm getting at now? A very LARGE majority of you all seem to treat university as if you're home alone while your parents are on vacation. You think it's time to PARTY PARTY!!! But it's not. You're meant to study, you're meant to get a job and start buying things you need. Money on sports games is money you can spend on that new pair of underwear or the shampoo you ran out of three days ago. You could use that money to pay for internet that would not only let you study like you need to, but let you stream without stutter or game without lag. And I don't want to hear all this ""I can't"" bull crap. You may have university which means you have class and you have homework, but that's nothing new from everyone else in the world. Everyone has things in their life that also needs to be done after they work. Be it cleaning, taking care of others, taking care of themselves, or what have you. Just because you have class and homework is not a reason not to work and take care of your responsibilities.  


So I hate to be the one to make this perfectly clear, but University is a place to learn as well as a trial run to being a adult. Time to wake up, notice that, and actually take steps to be a adult and not the child that we keep seeing everywhere we go throughout MSU.

Sixth College Town Hall #1 Recap (New Housing!),47,7,"Figured I would make a thread with all the info I remember from attending the town hall yesterday. This was the first in a series of three meetings this school year about Sixth's transition to its new location. Without further ado...

* Next year, Sixth College will move entirely from it's current location to the North Torrey Pines Living and Learning Neighborhood (also to be called the Sixth College Neighborhood)
   * This is the area over former parking lots P207 and P208, so Marshall will be to the north and east and Muir will be to the south
   * Current Muir College Drive will terminate at Scholars Drive North, promenade will connect to Ridge Walk
   * Scholars Drive N will likely continue south through the NTPLLN, connecting with current Muir Lane and completing the campus loop
      * Current Muir Lane east of the intersection with this new section of Scholars Drive will likely become limited access for lot P206 only
   * When Sixth moves, current Sixth Res Halls will be demolished (summer 2020), Seventh will move into The Village, transfer students will move into current Sixth College Apartments/Matthews Apartments
      * Vertical structures will be built over current Sixth Res Halls
      * Sixth College Apartments/Matthews Apartments will eventually be demolished (\~10 years)
* Comprised of six buildings total, Sixth College has administration over four of them (presumably buildings 2-5)
   * temporary building names are numerical, with 1 in the northeast corner and increasing counterclockwise (3 and 4 are closest to ocean)
   * Building 1 will contain arts and humanities as well as social sciences
   * Building 2 is residential, will contain Sixth College Administrative Center
   * Building 3 is residential, will contain a 300-person classroom potentially used for movie screenings or other events (this may be the digital stage)
   * Building 4 is residential
   * Building 5 is residential, will contain a two-story themed dining hall, a market, four retail stores, and potentially a coffee shop
   * Building 6 is an auditorium
   * buildings will be LEED Platinum certified, with energy-efficient lighting, some solar panels, an anaerobic digester system, etc.
   * buildings will be 14/15 stories tall, views ""get good above the sixth floor"" (including ocean views!)
      * meeting rooms on top floors, although likely restricted access by which groups control them
      * Provost Chilukuri doesn't get an ocean view office :(
* Neighborhood will also contain
   * two green lawns, West Quad and East Quad, surrounded by the buildings
      * paths stretch across these lawns
   * underground parking lot beneath neighborhood (1200 spaces according to 2018 LRDP)
      * accessed near Buildings 2 and 5
      * likely no S spaces
   * many balconies
   * many mixed indoor-outdoor spaces
   * lounges and gathering spaces in residential buildings
      * currently negotiating with campus to improve campus-wide access to public spaces, including lounges
   * community garden atop Building 3
   * the return of the Craft Center in Building 5 (will host classes, likely will have to sign up to use space)
   * digital stage, music room, sound booth (latter two in Building 4)
   * new and improved Sixth College Commuter Lounge
   * smart classroom, other classrooms, conference rooms
   * basketball courts
* Residential space will have room for 2010 beds as currently planned
   * (Sixth currently plans to house 1600-1800 students, extra beds will be used for overflow from other colleges)
      * (Sixth overflow ideally goes to neighboring colleges)
   * housing will have apartments, suites, singles, doubles (no triples!)
   * apartments may house 6 or 8, suites may house 12 (24 total on a floor)
   * 60% doubles, 40% singles
   * some floors will be connected internally by stairs, but the apartments won't have this
* Housing amenities
   * Res halls will access to shared communal kitchens, apartments will contain kitchens (both fully furnished)
   * bathrooms will be similar to current arrangements, though there will be separated sinks outside
      * showers and toilets will be separated, will be in stalls
   * no A/C but natural ventilation is built in (will be active even when windows are closed)
   * wi-fi will be present (no Ethernet as per new campus policy)
      * public spaces will have faster internet than rooms (see below)
* Themes
   * Promoting interactions between people
      * see wi-fi example above
      * living types will be mixed on the same floors
      * interior stairs
   * building name theme is transformation
   * names have been proposed by admin working with groups, but are open to suggestions
      * Building 2: Catalyst, Current (theme color blue)
      * Building 3: Kaleidoscope, Metamorphosis (theme color green)
      * Building 4: Tapestry, Thread (theme color brown)
      * Building 5: Mosaic, Medley (theme color orange)
   * Sixth College will **not** be named until the college has transitioned and adjusted to its new space (so not soon)

At the town hall, administration fielded suggestions for festivals to commemorate the transition as well as alternate building name suggestions. There will be opportunities both online and in person to suggest ideas, which are not limited. For example, people suggested art installations and allowing crafts classes to fulfill GEs, although the latter idea would take dedicated effort. The next town hall will likely be in Winter Quarter 2020.

[This site](https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/projects/transforming/ntplln.html#Project-Videos) contains an overview of the project, as well as a [PDF](https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/_files/ntplln-image-renderings.pdf) with concept photos, some of which were in the presentation.

""Are you students? Do you have enough income?"" and when we said that we were part time workers she just said ""Yea, but do you still receive 2 times amount of the rent""

""If you're not serious, I don't want to waste your time"" (WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!)

We later on, called the manager and talked to her about how we were unsatisfied with her employees attitude. Although she apologized for her actions, she proceeded to be rude and disrespectful.

\-I'm a stoner, so I smoke everyday, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about where that will be possible. At my last school literally everyone smoked in their rooms so it wasn't really a worry, and now I'm wondering if that's the way it is at the Village, or if I should just hope to find something off campus?

About me, I’m a Microbiology major transfer who is currently striving towards medical school (possibly pharmacy or PA if things don’t pan out). My favorite shows include Psych, Brooklyn 99, Rick & Morty, and Planet Earth II (that cinematography tho). I feel like I’m just above average cleanliness, and just below average socialness starting at a new school. Likely will try to spend most of my time studying, and doing some school extra currics. And I have visited the SD campus pretty excessively.

Looking for others in the same pre-med boat, but not a requirement. Other desired qualities: relative cleanliness, not super loud past 2am, and some interest in going to the gym.

I would also love any feedback from the veteran UCSD redditors about housing or tips for transfers coming to UCSD in general! Hope you killed your finals (or enough of your classmates bombed for a desired curve)",c0g5h4,ucsd

Housing question off waitlist,2,2,"So I was just admitted off the waitlist on Tuesday and I just decided to accept the offer after visiting campus.

Will I still be eligible for on-campus housing now? I tried emailing the admissions office but if I don't stay on-campus I am not likely going to go.",bn7t1q,ucsd
freshman housing,4,4,"hello, I was hoping someone could clear something up for me--

I'm an incoming freshman student, and I've been hearing different things about housing applications. On something I got from UCSD in the mail, it was said that when you turn in your housing application doesn't effect your chances of getting what you want. On the other hand, I've seen posts on this sub talking about housing lotteries and first come first serve. 

So does it matter or not?",b9v8bj,ucsd

No triples @ Torrey pines LLC (sixth) & Sixth WILL be named soon,42,17,"Sixth will receive a name(some time in the future but not in the next year) and the new sixth living community will NOT have any triples!! With various rooms having ocean view :)

*Apartments and Residence halls will not be in separate buildings (allowing for my interaction between 1st and 2nd years)
*As of the next couple years there should be NO overflow housing out of sixth, in fact, there should be overflow coming in from neighboring UCSD colleges as we will have extra beds.

Off-Campus Housing,2,12,"Hello. I'm a second-year interested in off-campus housing next year. I am unfamiliar with how the process works, so I have several questions if you could help me answer.

1. How much is considered a good monthly rent?
2. When do you register/sign up? What does the process look like?
3. I heard that there's a housing fair in January, but I've heard from a friend that sign-ups usually occur in November. Why do the sign-ups take place before the fair?
4. What are some places to live? I know this is subjective, but I'm looking for somewhere affordable and nice like the Reserve or River Club not somewhere expensive and luxurious like the Connection or the Standard. What are some places that have the buses that commute to campus? Also, I heard some places don't charge for water. IDK if that's true tho.",d31gi1,UGA

Anyone else have an absolutely hellish experience living at The Redlands?,42,14,"This is NOT a housing post — just trying to see if my experience was an isolated one. 

When I lived at The Redlands a few years ago, we moved into a cockroach-infested unit. These German cockroaches were just everywhere: in bedrooms, on the walls, in the couch, in the kitchen, and sometimes, when I brewed a cup of coffee, there would be those tiny baby cockroaches just floating in my cup. Of course, we spoke with the landlord and got an exterminator to come to our apartment and say, ""Yes, this is a cockroach infestation."" Even so, they did nothing to help us and we essentially had to live in that infested unit until our lease was up. 

A couple years later, my partner took over someone's sublease through The Redlands, just for six months. Although he didn't have a cockroach problem, he never got his deposit back (not a huge deal, but a bit annoying since he was only there for so long and kept the place nearly pristine because he's a neat freak). But months after he moved out and was living in a completely different city — hours away — he got hit with hundreds of dollars' worth of charges. Some of the charges were more typical things, like a cleaning fee or a new paint fee, but The Redlands claimed he stole some of the furniture out of his unit (which he definitely didn't), so the charges were pretty damn expensive. 

He paid the charges but it obviously set him back a bit. Has anyone had experiences like this? Sometimes they're just isolated cases, so I don't know.",e1i6be,UGA
Job for Spring Semester (2020)?,14,7,"Does anybody know of a good way to go about lining up a decent job that's convenient and gives a decent amount of hours (or pay) for next semester?

I worked fast food for 2 years in high school and would like to avoid it now. Only thing I liked about it was that it taught me how to manage my time. So essentially anything non-food I am open to. Just would like some extra spending money and something to keep me from wasting my free time on Netflix for another whole semester. Ideally I would like to lock down a job now and be able to start in January once break ends. Any advice on how to go about it would be much appreciated!

Housing situation?,3,4,"I love my roommate dearly, but she is really contributing to the downfall of my mental health. I have several mental disorders. She stays up all night making all kids of awful noise, she keeps her side of the room a complete mess, and is just quite insensitive when it comes to my mental illness. I get very little sleep because she is up so much and the dorm is just a generally chaotic environment. The people across the hall and next door are always screaming at all hours of the night (this is not a high rise, believe it or not).
I've had a major spike in my anxiety and I discussed it with my psychiatrist. He said that me not sleeping is a main factor in it. I'm also taking a pretty stressful class right now. I have told her about what my doctor said about me needing more sleep, but she has done nothing to help with that, she is still making noise st 3.30 in the morning just the same.
All that being said, I really dont know what to do. Living in this dorm has me mentally and physically destroyed (that might sound a little dramatic). I have changed medications 3 times this semester and have been put on strong sleeping pills. I've also lost a significant amount of weight because of the stress. 
I'm already enrolled with the DRC because of dyslexia, but could they possibly help with this too? I know it would be a big headache to move to a single room next semester, considering my dorm doesn't have any. I know it would also hurt my roommates feelings really badly, and that's the last thing I want to do.
I guess I'm just asking for advice, maybe if anyone else has had this situation as well.",9vp90o,UGA
Dog-friendly housing close to campus/near bus lines?,3,6,"Hi!

I'm looking into an apartment for next year for me, my partner, and our pupper. Our biggest concern after our dog is transportation; we don't have a car and while we plan on saving up money for one, money is a bit tight at the moment so there's no guarantee that we'll get a car any time soon.

 So with that, we're looking for apartments that are (preferably) within walking distance to campus, or near bus lines that could get us to campus and downtown. We're currently living in University Village which is $725 a month, so I'm looking at places around the same range. The first place I found that seemed to fit all that was [Bromsgrove Apartments](http://www.bromsgroveapt.com/home.html) \- does anyone have experience with them? Or any other suggestions? 

Side note: I've been seeing some apartments that accept small dogs (under 30 pounds), but our dog will be medium-sized when he's fully grown, so those probably won't work unless they're very lenient on the size policy.

Stay at uga?,13,15,"Hey, 
So currently I am a 2 yr biology major looking on either pursuing pre-med or research in the future. I got into tech as a conditional pathway transfer because my dad, whos a tech alumni, really wants me to go there, and he says premed there is the best in Georgia (supposedly). Now, i know that there's more prestige and stem research opportunities at gt, but i feel like as long as one works hard, it doesnt matter where you start from, you can get to wherever you want to go. Also, i have a job lined up for the fall already, good classes picked out, housing/roommate, a scholarship etc. Im in the honors program as well. If I go to tech as a bio major summer transfer, not only do I get the last pick for classes, but I have to take computer sci and calculus too, which in my opinion, is irrelevant to my major. I also fall behind in my coursework. But I dont know if its worth that cuz academics are better at gt. And im not a party girl at all, so the whole social life debate is irrelevant to me. And i know its bias to ask on here, but what do yall think is the best option? Does a tech degree get you much farther in life than a uga one? Since its only undergrad, does it really matter even?

Not only to make things easier and less awkward such as explaining who should take the trash out and when, when cleaning should be done and bills paid etc. (because lately I've been doing all of it but then again I haven't said anything otherwise), and like discussing whether we should just buy staples like bread, milk, and cheese together instead of on our own and stuff, but like also... I kinda just wanna be friends? Like I think it'd be cool to have a friend.

Would it be a dick move to take some of the ice cream that's in the dorm freezer?,3,11,"Reasons for: there's a lot of ice cream in there, its the end of the semester so there's no way anyone could finish the ice cream before everyone goes home, no one's name is on it

Reasons against: I would be pissed if someone stole my food (but I also would not put it in a public freezer without my name on it, so I'm assuming its a free-for-all in there)

Update: I did not eat it. I found some chocolate in my fridge and I saw no reason to eat someone else's food.",bkfz5w,UGA

Lodge of Athens Question/housing crisis,6,3,"Anyone know if you can switch rooms to get a person who has just signed a lease even though you have already signed your lease for next year?  I'm in the middle of tough decision of living in comfort at the standard or living with someone I know who can't move out of the Lodge for parental payment reasons.  I like the standard a lot, but I can only afford a 4 person and I have never once had good roommates here at UGA.  I can't trust that I'll have the same luck the third time.  I know the person well who is living at the lodge, but it's the lodge.  I've heard lots of complaints about it from roaches to homeless people wandering near the gates.  Whenever I've been inside, the rooms seem dingy and smell musty.  So My situation is this:
TL;DR I can either live in luxury with probably shitty roommates, or I can live in a place that I don't really like for location, safety, and cleanliness with someone I know I will get along with.  What would y'all recommend?",7g13ct,UGA

Incoming freshman: housing question,9,16,"Hi! So I was accepted early decision to UGA, and after thinking long and hard about it, I have decided to attend there. Go Dawgs! I was wondering if someone could answer a couple of questions that I have about housing, though:

1. What is the roommate selection process like? My mom gets all excited about this and calls it roommate tinder, lol. Is it actually a system where you get to pick, ask people about themselves, strike up a relationship, etc. or is it just getting matched up with someone?

2. What are the odds of getting into one of my top three building choices? So... I'm really not very smart, and I waited until... last week or so to actually register for housing... so I'm behind all the EA people but ahead of the RD people. Do I still have a shot to get into one of my top three? For reference, I believe I picked Reed, Rutherford, and Building 1516. 

3. What was your overall experience with UGA housing? After freshman year, are you/have you stayed on campus or living off campus? 

Thank you so much! And I hope everyone reading this is having a lovely day 💖",5pb7b9,UGA

HOUSING CHOICE- FRIENDS OR CONVENIENCE?,4,13,"Hey UGA! I'm going to be a sophomore in the fall. I originally wanted to live off campus, but that didn't work out so now I'm looking at on campus.
3 of my closest friends and a lot of other people from my graduating class are going to be living in ECV next year. We all had this idea that we would share one of the 4-person suites, and live like a family.

However, my classes are mostly North campus. I also do not have a car, and plan to be involved with a lot of clubs next year(and don't want to be stranded at night, or have to regularly rely on people). I decided that it might be a good idea to look into Reed, though the social scene atmosphere seems pretty abysmal(I also found another friend to live with though, if I do decided to go Reed).

The latter choice gives me a lot of anxiety because I do not want to be cut off from my friends. However, choosing ECV might not make it worth it to pay so much for the ""convenience"" of living on campus, as I would be far away from a lot of the facilities that I frequent on North Campus(all of my classes, library, MLC, Tate, etc.)
Is better to choose housing based on friends/sense of community(ECV) or convenience(Reed)? If I did choose ECV, would transportation be doable on nights that I had club meetings in North  Campus(I know the night bus isn't always the most reliable)?",5qwxut,UGA

"Experiencing Racism, would like advice.",167,43,"Hi, I've been living on campus for a while, and I'm looking for assistance or advice from people. I've been navigating through some incidents, such as the ones below. I've been trying to get on with it, but I've been growing increasingly miserable the more I experience incidents, similar to the ones described below. These are some of the more egregious cases, but there have been other incidents like this.

- Scenario 1:

I was in the student lounge studying for a midterm when some students start blasting music, the library is at the other end of campus, and I also like to play League of Legends on my laptop for break time. I ask if they could turn it down, but they respond by saying ""Can you speak English?"". I'm a little miffed, but then they start to implicate that ""Chinese people are dumb as hell"", and then ask me ""When's the next time you're going to eat a dog or cat?"". I wait for them to leave, some 2 hours later while they continue to ask if I'm watching pornography on the second level, and then turn on the radiator so that warm air will rise and make me uncomfortable. Yikes.

- Scenario 2: 


My suitemate regularly badgers me to help me do his maths homework, which is fine. But the issue is that he has essentially started to pass on his maths homework on to me complete, in exchange for... water. He recently asked me to take an online maths test (which was not proctored) for him, I refused blatantly due to the dishonourable implications it has. I'm not sure if the implication that I'm good at maths has to do with the fact that I'm Asian (it's rather not because I am good at math, I'm dreadful at it). He's been guilt-tripping me as well as I figure out problems saying that if it's hard for me to do his work, it would be really hard for him. I could be digging at the implied connections, but they may or may not be there.


- Scenario 3:


Roommate brings in girl at around 2:30 AM on Wednesday evening, they are being rather noisy. I ask the girl if she could be quiet. She says ""don't tell me what to do"", and says ""Can you speak English and not Chinese?"", they continue being noisy, I say ""Will you shut it?"", she says ""I'm not allowed to laugh? You ever heard of freedom of speech? You're not from here, you're from British (sic)"". It appears that visits from her will be rather regular now, since to the roommate, it's a girl from back home. I understand that, but I ask if he could visit her in her dormitory, since it was my room as well. He says that she's in there 90% of the time. I confronted her today, and asked if she could leave. It's a free country to her, so she refuses to leave. I talked about the racial statements made earlier, she said ""she didn't mean it"", but in a rather sarcastic way. 


Housing's been rather unavailable in my own time here. When Scenario 3 occured, I tried to get Housing to deal with the problem. Unfortunately, neither my CA, nor the housing office were available (I suspect that the officer on duty missed his shift). I did contact a nearby housing office for assistance and they very generously offered me a place to sleep for the night, but by then dawn was fast approaching and there was really no point because I had a class to catch.
 
I've been enjoying my time here, mostly through academic connections and talking to professors. But the racism, colourism, and overt inconsiderateness make me hesitate in terms of staying at the conclusion of the school year. There are other reasons why I would like to leave (mainly, I'm trying to change majors to Cognitive Science which unfortunately is not offered here). But I would like to be in a supportive and non-racist environment, and maybe enjoy a good night's sleep for the remainder of my time here. I'm also trying to gauge as to what I am doing currently, which I view as standing up for my own dignity and health is making the situation worse, since I am not really familiar with American culture. Is it really as racist and perhaps I would say — evil — as I've experienced it to be? I'm assuming that those people that I've experienced are in the minority.

I've already been moved once already, much for the same reasons as described above. But I'm trying to avoid racist situations in the future, while not relying on the rather unreliable housing office to deal with these problems. Would really appreciate guidance so that I don't feel like human scum at least once a week.

On-Campus Housing: The Be All End All Post,52,37,"Just gonna make this as inclusive as possible, feel free to add thoughts in the comments. I'm going to go over both freshman and upper division housing considering the volume of upper division posts recently, and the likelihood of a post increase as we go into the spring semester and potential freshmen get serious about ASU. 


I will only be covering Tempe Housing and Taylor Place (Downtown), so if Poly, West, Havasu (lol) people wanna chime in feel free. I'm not covering Roosevelt Point (Downtown) because I don't know shit about it. I wont' cover pricing, it's up to you to look up the housing options and decide if they're in your budget.


***Freshman Housing***

**Taylor Place**: Pretty solid overall, typical freshman experience. Situated right in the middle of everything at the Downtown Campus. A few floors are reserved for the Barrett community so if you're interested in being around Barrett students that's an option. Every other floor is connected by a staircase (2-3, 4-5, etc...). Rooms are similar to other shared dorm rooms, has liquid/solid composting toilet and regular sized bathroom. Dining hall is acceptable (Better than Hassyampa IMO), and used to provide tupperware for spare food though I am unsure of if this is still a practice. 

**Barrett Complex**: Pretty quality, but a bit pricey compared to other options. Requires Barrett enrollment which makes you take HON 171/272. Rooms types: shared room:shared bathroom, private room:shared bathroom, studio, quad (4 private rooms with 2 bathrooms total + living room). Main room is furnished. Each building/cluster of buildings has a floor with a TV, functioning kitchen and full laundry room. Pool/ping pong available at the front desk in Honors Hall. Hit or miss on social interaction. You either get really social or you get an introvert floor. Cereus/Cottonwood/Juniper are pretty social halls iirc. Dining hall rivals Tooker for the best on campus. Sits in the southeast corner of campus, so it's a bit of a trek if you have courses on the north or west end of campus, but it's still manageable as you can cross campus in 15 minutes walking. 

**Tooker**: Rivals Barrett in quality and price. All Engineering students and similar majors. Rooms are about the same size as other buildings. Free echo dot for living there (they used to do this, idk about now), pretty social atmosphere, lot of public study areas for your floor, pretty well situated as far as getting to engineering courses on the north end of campus goes. Dining room quality is near the best on campus. 

**Adelphi Commons II**: Essentially apartments, it's arranged by clusters because it used to be a sorority complex before the GLV came out. Now it's the the College of Integrative Arts and Sciences + Sustainability haven. It's right next to Adelphi 1, Barrett, and the complex with the campus walmart and other restaurant. You'd default to Barrett or Hassy dining halls from here.

**Adelphi Commons I**: See above, but is essentially alternative housing for WPC. 

**Hassyampa**: There are two sides to Hassyampa, a west and an east. Hassy is one of the apexes of freshman socialization. Rooms are decently spacious but still have a weird stone ceiling. Elevators always smell like weed, even if no one is smoking. Hassy dining hall isn't terrible, but isn't up to par with Tooker and Barrett. If you're in WPC and you wanna be social, this is probably where you're gonna end up.

**Best/Hayden**: For Herberger. I wouldn't live here if I was paid to on account of smaller rooms and communal bathrooms. Oldest dorms on campus along with Irish. **Irish** is in the same little complex but isn't just Herberger. Close to a lot of stuff on campus, so I suppose that's a plus. 

**San Pablo**: Near Tooker, covers a few colleges. Pretty basic experience, but I'd probably opt for PV West if given the choice. 

**PV West/East**: West is better and more social in addition to being nearer to the study area/POD/starbucks/etc... East isn't bad but people generally aim for West. Don't think I've actually met someone who lives in East. North side of campus near Tooker. 

**Manzanita**: One of the nicer freshman housing options, it's just east of tooker and PV. It has it's own dining hall (about the same quality as Hassy) and has a solid social scene. 

**Century (Poly**: Commentor opinion: ""I'm a current freshman living in Century Hall on Poly so here's my take: Dorms are rather basic but modern. You share a bathroom with 2 suitemates, so the bathroom is quite large, but can get cluttered quickly. All the freshman are there, barrett is on 3rd floor but it's gotten big enough that it's overflown to the 2nd floor. Walls are thin so if you're blasting music/doing the sex/talking loud enough it'll be heard. Right next to Citrus dining, poly market, and the SDFC. Classrooms are a quick walk, and even quicker bike/board ride. As for dining, it's the only one on campus so it's rather basic but palatable IMO. Even if you're barrett, on poly you only get a standard meal plan. The Student Union also has some to-go options. Century is rather pricy as it's newer, around 7.5k/sem. Upper div lives in converted officer houses for about half the price.""

*If you have anything to add to these, comment it. My experience is mostly with Tooker/Barrett/Hassy/Taylor Place so other insights are appreciated*

***Upper Division***

*Disclaimer*: NO UPPER DIVISION HOUSING HAS DORM ROOM SOCIALIZATION. IT'S EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS IF YOU PUT YOUR BEST FOOT FORWARD BUT NO ONE IS GOING TO DROP FRIENDS IN YOUR LAP LIKE THEY DID FRESHMAN YEAR. That question has been asked a lot and this is the answer to that. 

**Vista Del Sol**: Apartments. Kinda pricey, rooms are nice and come with fully equipped kitchens. There are different room configurations for shared or private, but most are private room/private bath with connected living rooms. Full amenities included, internet isn't bad. Not super social but there are ways to make friends.

**Greek Leadership Village**: You ***MUST*** be associated with a fraternity or sorority that has a building in the GLV to live here. Rooms and common areas are really nice and you exclusively live with your brothers/sisters. It's close to campus as well and provides easy access to the east end. Only downside is they are still essentially dorms and ASU is scrutinizing your every move. 

**Villas at Vista**: Vista but better. Apartments and townhouse-esque buildings available. Slightly more expensive but just across the street from vista. Very nice overall if you can justify the price, and they're no longer restricted to Greek Life and Athletics. 

**University House**: Run of the mill apartment building, pool in the middle. Gets very rowdy on game days and has a pretty vibrant party/drinking scene, but as a result of it now being ASU owned it and thus *on campus*, it is under scrutiny. Some of the balconies near the top allow you to look into Sun Devil Stadium. 

**Sonora**: Lower end of things, but still acceptable. Just south of Vista, not bad pricing, just a bit farther of a walk. Elevators like to stop working sometimes so if you're on the 5th floor, have fun. 

**Rise on Apache and 922 Place**: University House but on Apache and nicer overall. I have no real complaints about Rise, very nice apartments. Maybe gets a bit loud because most people who live there like to have a good time. Pretty social overall.

*Rise on Apache Commentor Opinion*: "" They’re known for having the worst management by far of the complexes in the area and will have water or electricity cut out for extended periods of time occasionally.""

**McClintock International Commons**: Meh

Upper division students can choose to live in communities such as: Tooker, Barrett, Hayden, etc... but those vary by experience.

I'll update this periodically as I get more information, just a basic outline for now. Comment with your experiences and I'll make edits.

Happy Innovating!

Need summer housing?,0,0,"Hi everyone!

I am looking for someone to take over my lease at the District on Apache this summer. 

I currently live in a 4 bed 4 bath. Each room has it’s own bathroom, and this one has a walk in closet with a pool view! One of my roommates is moving out because they are going to graduate, so it’s like having a 3 bedroom for a lower rate.
Rent is $849, and all utilities are included except the electric bill, which is split between all roommates, however I am willing to pay that for you. 
You can move in whenever you’d like, and the lease ends July 31, with the option to extend it into the 2019-2020 school year. This is a great opportunity if you’re planning on living here for the Fall semester because you essentially get to move in early.

-Washer / dryer in unit
-Lazy river + hot tub 
-Two story gym
-Grills
-Walking distance to ASU (across the street)
-Pet friendly

I didn’t realize I had left my keys on the main campus until after I got back to the West campus...had to take bus back to main to search for the keys.  I have checked with lost and found, talked to bus drivers and tried pinging the Tile on the keys (but now the tile is not pinging back).  The last time they pinged was this morning at 10:25am in the MU saying it was near the pitchforks dining pavilion.

Description:  Black Honda Pilot key with three house keys; one house key is silver, one is camouflage, and the last one is dark blue with yellow stars on it. There is a black ribbon attached that says the word “SUGA” in silverish holographic lettering and a gray Tile piece.

Please let me know if you have seen them.

Housing Options for a Semester,1,3,"Hello, I am a transfer student coming to ASU for the Spring of 2019 Majoring in Sports Business and am a Junior. I sent in my housing application a while back and they told me that I would receive my housing in mid November. When that rolled around and I didn't hear anything I emailed housing. They told me that it was based on order of submission and that I would hear something soon. Okay I thought, so I waited and I still hadn't heard anything so I emailed again and they responded today with the same message except this time they added that housing for transfer students is not guaranteed. I was very unaware of this because I was never told this up until today. Being December 10 and with classes starting less than a month away this stresses me out. I currently live 3 hours away and was planning on living in a dorm, but since I might not be getting one what should my housing options be? I've been looking at apartments on the Living ASU page but would the price be outrageous for just a semester? Should I wait and see if I get a dorm? Or should I just rearrange my schedule and do online classes and come to campus for Fall of 2019? Any thoughts and opinions would be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Edit: My sister who currently lives in Texas is moving back to the Phoenix area in July so I would only need my dorm or apartment for the Spring semester only.

"On-campus housing, off-campus housing, or commute to ASU Tempe campus?",7,25,"Hey guys, so I’ll be going to ASU Barrett this fall as a freshman. I already applied for housing (Agave), but I never submitted the application and I’m starting to have second thoughts about on-campus living. I’m almost positive that it would be significantly cheaper for me to just rent a room in an apartment or house nearby and go to school. The main issue is the meal plan. I’m a small Asian girl and I seriously do not think I’ll spend $5500 for a whole school year’s worth of food (and that’s not even three meals a day smh). I’m also am considering bringing my car with me on campus, so I don’t really want to pay for parking fees either. On the other hand, I live about 25 minutes away from ASU, and I could commute to school, but I’m honestly only planning to dorm for freshman year for the “college experience”.

HFS sent out an email this afternoon following up from the rejection sent a week ago.

>Dear Student,  
>  
>We are writing to you as your application to live in gender-inclusive housing was denied. In the past, gender-inclusive housing was called gender neutral housing and the process for being accepted into gender neutral housing was much easier. Some students requested gender-inclusive housing without fully understanding or committing to the goals of gender-inclusive housing. This year in an effort to truly honor the integrity of gender-inclusive housing, we strengthened our language and increased the scrutiny for which we reviewed applications to ensure that every student assigned to gender-inclusive housing truly understood and was committed to the goals of creating gender inclusive spaces in our residential communities.

>  
>·  Students who are transitioning from one gender to another;  
>  
>·  Students who do not wish to identify themselves by sex or gender identity;  
>  
>·  Students who identify as outside of the gender binary;  
>  
>·  Students whose gender identity is fluid;    
>  
>·  Students who do not conform to society’s expectations to their gender assigned at birth (gender non-conforming)  
>  
>If you identify with the list above, we apologize for the burden that this process may have created; we invite you to reapply and it is our sincere hope that you can appreciate that we are trying to ensure that the goals of gender-inclusive housing are upheld.

>If you do not identify with the list above and are looking to live in gender-inclusive housing for reasons other than the goals of this housing option, please note that mixed-gender housing is only available in our 12-month communities.

Since people expressed interest in seeing what the commitment entailed, here's what's in the form:

>It is **critically important** to us that gender-inclusive spaces feel especially welcoming and supportive for students across the spectrums of gender identity, gender expression, biological sex, and sexual identity.  Because of our strong commitment to inclusivity and safety in these spaces, we have high standards for students interested in living in gender-inclusive housing to demonstrate their understanding of gender and what it means to be specifically aware of the needs of:

These are not the same questions that were on the application when we originally applied for housing this year. Question 4 was not present and Question 5 was there but more along the lines of ""what will you do to create a gender-inclusive space"" though I don't remember the exact wording. It's clear they added ""intentionally"" and ""please be specific"" as a response to answers that didn't meet their expectations.

It's also clear that this time around they steered away from language that suggests GIH is intended to be any sort of community. The word ""community"" isn't in the agreement and the email refers only to ""an allied member of this community""/""this hurdle is intended to support the community,"" which could be intended to refer to the gender-inclusive community at large, and GIH in HFS has been reframed as ""creating gender inclusive spaces in our residential communities"" (where it's not implied that these spaces will be any larger than your room).",bhtwmn,udub

UW Tacoma Computer Science,35,29,"Hello everyone! This sub is mostly for UW Seattle content, and I often contribute to memes or stories or whatever about UW Seattle because I was a student there for a few years. But I'm currently at UW Tacoma for computer science and I often get asked tons of questions about UW Tacoma and their CS program in particular because there is no real mention of UW Tacoma online! So with this post I just thought I'd share my thoughts. 

**TL;DR:** Go to UW Seattle for Computer Science unless you are incredibly ambitious and able to take *full* advantage of UW Tacoma's resources. Also I'm bolding some words if you want to scan the concepts. 

UW Tacoma has some really great aspects and some really terrible aspects, the CS department in particular is no exception!

PROS:

* **Small class sizes**. Every class is about 30 people save 1 or 2 senior level requirements which can go up to 60-70. You work directly with your instructor in each class session, and if you ever have questions you're expected to be able to reach them at any time for whatever help. 

* A few very **good professors**. There are several specific faculty members at UW Tacoma that are an absolute joy to take a class from; they teach their material extraordinarily well while keeping nearly all students willingly engaged in each lecture. There are about 3-4 that I wish could teach classes to the whole world because of their teaching ability. 

* The school is **built for commuters**, so you can easily schedule your classes such that you only have T/Th days on campus or M/W(/F) etc. 

* Great on campus **resources** for computer science students, such as 2 credit seminars (TSS 390) each quarter which go further into detail on principles of object oriented design or algorithms design or other specific subjects to be taken in tandem with the main class on the subject, and an open cs computer lab staffed at all times with a student mentor who should be considered a subject matter expert with any coursework you're going through as a cs student. Things like these workshops and the 24/7 lab with a mentor are invaluable to students learning computer science for the first time. 

* Ability to do **projects and research with professors** you've directly worked with in classes. Nearly every professor here has a side project or research subject they're working on, and if you do well in their class you can ask to assist in their research or project. The **little opportunities** here **feel endless** and very approachable, unlike a place like Seattle which may feel more closed off from that sort of personal request for a research position etc. You don't apply to assist with a project here, you **just ask** and chances are you're the only one who even thought to ask. 

*  UW Tacoma is **cheaper** to attend than UW Seattle. The food and housing near campus is much more affordable than at the Seattle campus. 

* CSS (Computer Science and Systems) as a **major is easy to get into**. If you have even slightly good grades (2.5 min but 3.0 is fine), you will be admitted to this program. No bs get 3.9+ in CSE142 to have a chance at getting in if you ace your other classes (like Seattle had/has). 

* Part of why the major is easy to get into, is the program is still growing. Each year there's another change to improve the structure of learning each subject and I think all the changes I've seen have been positive. And as a growing program that's still not large, you **aren't expected to know any computer science going into the program**, or really need to do anything outside of the classes to succeed in the classes. Maybe that last sentence should go a bullet above but whatever. 

UW Tacoma is good for the ambitious students because they're able to take advantage of each of the opportunities available to full effect. That's by far the best pro, unless class size matters more to you. If you don't plan on taking advantage of all the little opportunities, don't come here if you have the option, because we're about to see all the cons:

CONS:

* Bad professors will sometimes give solid passing grades to students who aren't learning. This may sound like a pro, but you can do okay in subjects and not really be learning anything and moving on through the degree requirements without ever retaining anything. Some students to on ratemyprofessor and find the easiest person each quarter and take that instructor and end up with Bs without learning, which leads me to my next point.

* Sometimes in senior classes you're interacting with people who possibly shouldn't be there. This one sounds incredibly pretentious, but occasionally I'll be talking a student through a problem and they'll fundamentally misunderstand foundational knowledge going into the problem, and I blame their past professors for that. 

* There is **no student life** at UW Tacoma. Being a commuter campus, most everyone goes to school for their classes, then leaves immediately after. Leaves as in drive away 20+ minutes to their house. Friends hang out after class and get lunch sometimes, but that's after you make the friends first. Building a good study group can be really important to your success, but it's not even close to as easy as it is at UW Seattle. We have the seattle freeze here too, and it's harder because we don't all walk back to our rooms together and keep interacting for whatever reason outside of class. 

* **Stigma** with clarifying you're **not attending UW Seattle**. You can tell everyone at this school and in the outside world knows that Tacoma is not as good as Seattle, and everyone compares the two. It's not 24/7, but it's definitely a negatively contributing factor. You will be asked why you aren't just going to UW Seattle for CS by your neighbors and friends, and you should probably have an answer ready to reuse. Mine is ""I went there for a year or so but I didn't like living in the city and it was a bit to expensive for me, but I love the smaller class sizes at tacoma so it really works out"" or something to that effect. It's kind of annoying. 

* Lots of people that I know who graduate from UW Tacoma struggle to find a job (not limited to CS). I'm not sure if it's the school or the environment or a ton of coincidences or what, but it's something to consider - it's definitely easier to find a job with UW Seattle CS on your resume. 

Most significant negative is definitely the lack of student life, and I think I've even overcome that hurdle. Next worst thing is the stigma, but the first two points are lame as well. Not sure what to think about the jobs thing until I'm really affected and can get an inside look at that process and my thoughts/feelings. 

Again these are just my thoughts as a senior in this program who's been here for a bit.  I'm sure anyone at UW Tacoma who knows me could read this thread and know exactly who I am, and if that's the case then say hi! I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about UW Tacoma or UW Tacoma CSS, now or in a year or whenever. I'll probably link this thread as my thoughts when people ask in the future, and I'll also probably edit and adjust points as they become more or less relevant etc.",dqaqmk,udub

Housing / Food Off Campus?,19,40,"I'm interested in trying to get into udub for Fall 2019 as a transfer student, but have run into a bit of a problem. I've heard the Psychology/Sociology program here is one of the best in the US, and since I'm local & can afford to go here I figured, why not? Other than needing to retake my ACT, I think I should be able to get admitted(cross your fingers). However, one of the largest problems for me is that because I have Sensory Processing Disorder, so living in close quarters with someone else would be impossible for me. When I spoke to the housing department, they essentially told me the probability of getting a single unit dorm is -100%, as older students have seniority. I asked about apartments that the school owns and they said they're year contracts so I wouldn't be able to get one as a new student. Sigh.

I still want to try to attend here, despite not being able to live in the dorms. I figured I might try to get an off campus apartment but wasn't sure how smart of a decision that would be.

It's unlikely I'm doing this all at once, but they're on the table. On top of all that, I do have a full load of classes, and I'm a writer.

Are the sororities at UW known for being a huge time suck? Has anyone gone through the process and felt it was worth it? I love people and being around people all the time, but I also like having my own space every once in a while, and the housing situation for sororities sounds stressful. Any insight into any of this would be valuable.


EDIT: Money isn't a problem. Normally it would be, but I got some insane financial aid that would cover my housing costs. Other fees are more iffy, but I'm concerned about personal things: my anxiety (alleviated by my ESA, who probably can't come with me to a house), my sexuality (I'm gay, and I've met too many girls who get bizarrely scared/uncomfortable around me), and of course as I mentioned time. All your responses were positive and wonderful, thank you! Based on my first day I think I'll really enjoy it, but these other things weigh on my mind.

Yet another housing search post,7,32,"I know you guys are probably tired of all the posts complaining about housing but I'm going to try anyway.

I am a transfer student transferring from Grays Harbor College. I was admitted to UW and my major (CS - Woo!) but I didn't get my acceptance letter until a day before the priority 2 deadline for housing. So I ended up being in priority 3.

I didn't realize that housing at UW was so scare at the time.

I just recently got an email from HFS saying that they won't know if they'll be able to assign me until after September 20th and I might be assigned *after* Autumn quarter starts or put into temporary housing. I also have the option to deffer my housing application until Winter quarter for no cost.

Commuting isn't an option since I live three hours away from UW on a good day.

I have been browsing craiglist but I am a little overwhelmed because I'm not totally sure what I'm searching for. I don't know the Seattle area that well. I have noticed that most apartments require proof of income and some even require previous rental information. That is a problem for me because I don't have recent proof of income and I have never rented before. 

I do have money for rent though. I can probably spend about $1000 per month or a little bit more.

I know that there is a facebook group for housing although I do not have a facebook account. I guess I could create one just for that if I have to.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Additionally, is off campus housing really less expensive than on campus housing? Not including the dining plan, I'm paying ~$700 a month for 9 months of housing. So I feel that unless I am able to get a place for less than $700 a month and am able to get a person sublet for the Summer or a 9 month lease (as many of the places have 12 month leases I've found), I feel that I'm not that much better off choosing an off campus choice.

Transferring help,1,3,"So I go to school at Florida State College at Jacksonville and I'm hoping to transfer to FSU.

My current college has a few of the same prerequisites and I'm taking two of them in the spring. 

&#x200B;

When I transfer (if I get in; I got very depressed this semester and my GPA is going to struggle because of it) would I have to just retake a lot of my AA classes or would I just go ahead and do my AA here and continue into a bachelors in FSU? I know most schools won't take classes from other schools that they don't have in their own systems. I know this is probably a really dumb question in all honesty, but I don't know how transferring works from community colleges and state universities. I don't want to spend another 1.2K on classes I don't actually need or will just have to pay to take a replacement. I don't think anyone would.

I already have a plan for housing (I'll live with my family in Talle) and have a plan to pay for my classes the best I can.

NEW Housing Contract Process for Fall 2018/Spring 2019,13,9,"We are very excited about admissions decisions being released later this week and wanted to give you a heads up about our NEW housing contract process for newly admitted students! 

The Fall/Spring contract will open on Thursday, February 1, 2018 at 9 AM.  However, we know that you are busy and may have tests, school events, or family commitments at that time. NEW FOR THIS YEAR, you have the flexibility to submit the housing contract at any time from when it opens on February 1 through February 5 and be included in our earliest Welcome Window group. Students who submit contracts during the Welcome Window will all be entered into a lottery and will receive a randomized contract number on February 6th. The Welcome Window is your opportunity to be one of the earliest students to commit to living on-campus for next year! 

If you submit your contract on February 7th or later, you will receive a contract number based on the date and time your contract is submitted. The contract number serves as your “place in line” for receiving on-campus housing. Your contract number will be larger than those who contracted during the Welcome Window.

Please remember to activate your FSUID before accessing the housing portal to complete your housing contract. To activate your FSUID, visit my.fsu.edu and click “Activate my FSUID”.  You will need:
a.	Your EMPLID as provided by Admissions (a nine-digit number)
b.	Your date of birth
c.	The last five digits of your social security number

Please note: On-campus housing is not required or guaranteed for incoming students at FSU. The housing contract is binding if you attend FSU. The housing contract does not commit you to FSU.

Please use this megathread to celebrate and meet your fellow new Noles! Mods will be deleting any other decision-day related posts to help keep the sub from being overrun with them.

**When will decisions be released?**

Admission decisions will be released later this afternoon, after most students are out of school for the day. We don't have an exact time to share in advance.

**Where do I see my decision?**

Log in to the [Application Status Check](https://connect.fsu.edu/apply/status/) on our website. 

**What if I have questions about my decision?**

Give us a call at 850.644.6200. Our office will be open for phone calls until 9:00PM tomorrow, and we'll be back to our normal 8AM-5PM hours on Friday. We expect to receive *thousands* of calls over the next few days, and as a result our phone system can get very busy, so we appreciate your patience with longer than usual hold times and busy signals (if you get one, that means our 50-call queue is full, just try back again a little later). 

Please *do not duplicate your efforts to contact us* (in other words don't send an email and then call/tweet us with the same question). This will only further delay our response to you and to every other student with questions.

I got a notice from FSU that said that I need to show that I've completed a college level math course, so I'm going to take a CLEP test for that at the end of this month and send it to FSU to meet that requirment for transfer. I just had a few questions for anyone who might have an answer.

1. The college that I'm at right now is very non-traditional, we don't even have grades here and we don't follow the same kind of mapping for classes for certain majors that traditional colleges/universities (like FSU) have. So I was wondering if there was any way to see if I meet the requirements for the political science major with the classes that I've taken so far. I've looked at the academic map and I know what the classes are at FSU, but I don't know how those translate to ones that I've taken so far.

2. Since I have to do the CLEP test I probably won't get a decision for another month and a half, so with that in mind what are my odds for getting off campus housing? Should I apply for a dorm, or will I even be able to? And if there isn't a good chance to get a dorm, what are some good apartment options around the school?

Thank you! I hope to be seeing some of you this upcoming fall!",7ygn81,fsu

roommate/housing issues and poor timing,14,19,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently a freshman here at Pitt, and although my roommate and I have never really gotten along, our issues have been escalating over the past few weeks to the point where I do not feel safe or comfortable living in my dorm. I talked to my RA about a possible room change, but she said that the RD is very strict with room changes and that a switch next semester may not be likely. She said that the RD is reluctant to approve people moving out of the dorm because she prefers that people get along and work things out, but I feel that my situation is beyond that at this point.

I have been asking my upperclassmen friends for advice, as well as a friend of mine who is an RA at a different university. They have all said that this is not necessarily the case, and that I should be able to move out next semester without as much difficulty as my RA had implied.  Some have suggested that I go to Panther Central, but I feel like I will be told the same thing by them.

I can understand how it might be more difficult to move me to a room within the same residence hall, but is moving somewhere else, say, a single in Holland, just as difficult?  How should I go about this?  If anyone has experience with reslife and/or relocating, your insight would be appreciated. Thank you!",e7hrhw,Pitt

I know this has been said many times on here by other people but really, JRC Kelly is trash! They raise rent every year, they never fix maintenance problems, and are sexist and rude. 

I currently live in a house owned by JCR Kelly. To get them to fix major problems with the house, such a the front and back doors falling apart, the front steps crumbling, and the basement having both chipping lead paint and mold it, I had to call the health department. Only then did they come and fix the door and the mold. The other issues  are still to be fixed.  They have known about these problems for over a year, so there is no excuse. 

A friend of mine who also rents from them told me they called her a bitch and threatened to throw her out. 

They are shitty landlords who only care about money.",dwyq30,Pitt

Quitting a Housing Job? (plus another related question),16,11,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Anyways, I applied for a custodian position and I just completed orientation. During that time, I realized that I should have held off on getting a job until I was fully adjusted to living in a new area and learned how to manage my time with classes and studying. And I have pretty severe mental health problems that have been getting worse so I want to make sure I can handle everything before adding more commitments. I may want to quit before I officially start on Saturday for move-in, and before the September schedule is made. So I was wondering how I should go about quitting a job I completed orientation for, but have not officially started.

My second question has to do with what jobs count as Housing Jobs. Resigning without a two weeks notice makes you ineligible to apply to another housing job for 4 months, so I was wondering if the DoIT Help Desk/Phone Line is considered as a housing job, or if housing jobs are just things like custodians, dining hall employees, house fellows, front desk workers, etc. (or basically just jobs that involve working in a dorm) Thanks",cxc4y5,UWMadison

Question: does anyone know when final temporary housing announcements come out? I know that some people receive their permanent assignments throughout the summer once a dorm opens up. At what point does the school just admit that a permanent bed isn't going to open up before classes start (in like two weeks!) and they just tell me where my temporary housing/den is located/who I will be living with.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/b8ors2/residence_halls_master_thread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is a pinned thread about redditor opinions on residence halls, and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NLfTlz5RcBFAR5UdPspXoo3Mg6djsVzzBGQq6Yt0TEw/edit?usp=sharing) is an awesome google doc with pictures that summarizes everything about the halls available.

I and everyone else in this sub can promise you'll still have an amazing time no matter where you land. Dejope is far, Cole is small, Sellery is gross, Smith isn't real, the list goes on. Dejope has an awesome environment with tons of freshmen on freshmen-dedicated floors, Cole has a super tight-knit community and dope basement, and everyone struggles together about the cleanliness of SE dorms for some nice bonding moments and stories for Monday mornings.

House Fellows of UW-Madison. How do you feel about the work requirements this year?,57,21,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.

As house fellows there isn't a way for us to discuss work requirements across units cause we are more or less completely separated from the start of training onwards. Witte stays with Witte, PhD stays with PhD, Smith stays with Smith and so on. Discussing within unit can be tricky too because people want to stay professional or feel discouraged from speaking up because of the threat of conduct hearings. I think all of this creates a stressful atmosphere, where people more or less have to do whatever they're told no matter what they're told.

I want to open up the forum for people to discuss the increase in work requirements this year and ask if other people are feeling incredibly stressed out by what \*seems like\* an almost doubled work load.

The increase in paperwork associated with residents, weekly event requirements,  intentional conversations, quiet hours no tolerance policies, extra shifts on football games, etc. It's all becoming a lot to juggle.

I’m not totally opposed to drinking but would probably only want to do it 1-2 times a month or less and I like to study in my dorm room.

I hate it but hella trying not to,40,48,"Hi. I'm an out of state freshman. I couldn't afford dorms, so I had to settle down for a room that is rented in a house. All rooms are rented out, and there are about 10 roommates. I lived here for 3 days, and so far hated it.

Maybe this is due to being homesick or the fact that I'm sleeping on a floor right now. Or the fact that maybe my expectations were just too high. So my room is pretty small which is something I'm okay with. But I have another very small door leading to an inside of a roof (which I did not know about from the photos). From there, ants are coming in (like 5 or so, so nothing bad) but we are getting pest control to look into that. Then, the whole place was dirty. There is crap in the crack between the carpet and the floor and the space between the window and the filter thing haven't been cleaned in years and still have food wrappers in it. The bathroom is also pretty bad but it might be due to iron content within the water, which is why a lot of it is orange.

Downstairs, they are still catching mice (they killed all but one) and it's so cold because of the ac that I wake up during the night (I put something on the ac hole, so hopefully it would make it better). The whole place is old and the basement is a nightmare.

I talked to my roommates whether they like it here, and they say that it mainly depends from other roommates. One even said that I was lucky to get this place because the landlord is absolutely amazing (which she is).

I've been trying to love Madison and been exploring with an amazing local friend. But honestly, its been very hard. I have to do this, and it's only for 4 years but so far I've hated my whole experience so far.

The Sett Rant,68,44,"
The Sett changed their menu right at the beginning of this year. I was optimistic going in since the sett was never anything to rave about, not saying it was bad or anything. 

   However this new menu is not good. Like  at all. Every new item I’ve gotten has been terrible. I got the Philly cheese steak and it wasn’t super flavorful. On top of that the cheese and pepper mix they put on the top of the sandwich looked like straight up vomit. I’m not expecting some really good cheese steak out of the restaurant in the union of a college in Wisconsin but like idk anyone whose gonna want to eat that thing. I got the garlic parmasean wings recently and the sauce was horrendous. It had a gross texture and idk what the flavor was but it’s nasty. I’m glad they put it on the side cause I threw that shit out immediately. I don’t think I’m very picky either. I ate the philly cheese steak despite it being gross. I could not eat that ducking sauce. I haven’t tried any of their new burgers but considering I was never a huge fan of the burgers before I don’t imagine the new ones will be much better. Maybe their salads are good or something

I just don’t understand why when they were redoing the menu they actually thought these new items would be an improvement. Ik they took off a bunch of items that were fine including garlic fries which I thought was the best thing on their menu. Maybe it’s a money thing idk. The only good thing they did was add the sett cause but it’s just the same sauce as der rath skeller that they make in the whatever kitchen they make that sauce in UW and then ship it over and imo there’s no reason that the Sett shouldn’t have had it before. They might as well have brought the ranch over cause they “house make” it at der rath skeller (idk if it’s actually house made but it’s better than the super thick stuff at the Sett). Also there is like never condiments like any time I’ve gone this year in the pumps. Idk what’s up with that.

In terms of just talking about a restaurant I shouldn’t care much. I mean I’m not tryna go to the Sett to have good food, I’m going there cause I have classes on the south end of campus and I want lunch. But with harvest grains closed the best restaurant in my opinion is somehow urban slice (ginger root isn’t good either)and it should not be that way. I just am frustrated by options at this point and I can just get like chicken nuggets and fires at the sett but I used to actually like going there (occasionally). I never thought I’d say that the most appetizing place in Union South is URBAN SLICE like what.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

[JOB] House Manager (RA-like) for Privately Owned RPI Student Housing,9,5,"I represent the ownership group of a ~20 room building in downtown Troy, normally used for fraternity housing. With the chapter suspended for this school year, we are looking to rent out rooms for the upcoming spring semester. We would like to hire a student house manager for oversight.

A rough list of what the responsibilities could be:
- Collecting leases from residents before move-in
- Accomplish walk-through of the rooms with residents before move-in and after move-out to determine room condition 
- Be the residents point of contact, relaying building/room concerns to us for disposition.
- Provide outside contractors access to the building as directed for maintenance/repairs.
- Ensure lease policies are enforced

Compensation for this would be **free housing for the duration of your employment**, which could be extended through the summer and maybe even through the 2020-2021 school year. Ideally, the candidates would be graduate students with a demonstrated history of dependability. Day to day responsibilities would be minimal, we just want to have someone living onsite who can be our representative.

Arch and Housing (questions from a landlord),19,7,"Hi All,

Last year I purchased a student rental property in Troy and was fortunate to inherit a group of stellar tenants, most of whom have now graduated. My current tenants moved in June 1 and so far, so good. With the summer Arch program, however, their situation seems less than ideal. Most are not even using the rental this summer, but I believe were willing to sign a 12 month lease in order to secure the property from Sept-May. The price is good, so I can see why they'd go this route.

As students settle into Arch, however, I'm wondering if we can't come up with some more appealing options for these students. So, a few questions: What, as a result of Arch, would be the optimal lease type? What would be less optimal, but better than a 12 month lease (keeping in mind landlords don't want to take a wash either, or be left with uninhabited buildings)?   For rising juniors who have searched for off 2019-2020 off-campus housing this year, what kinds of leases did you encounter? Traditional 12 month? I noticed that 15th Street Properties has flexible lease lengths- an approach that might work for a giant company, but is less than ideal for a small-timer like me. I've wondered about these flexible 3, 6, 9, 10, and 12 month leases, too, because they seem to be a recipe for living with strangers who are constantly coming and going. No?

Relatedly, does the moving required by Arch make having furnished apartments even more appealing than it was before? Would you rather pay for the convenience of having utilities included (for a higher rate- say $100 more per person), or manage the utilities yourself and potentially save some money?

Well, with a little help from floor-plans and google maps, I came up with a rough count of how much housing is 'reserved' for sophomores, and while there is more than I initially suspected, reslife is still short about 250 heads. This isn't counting housing that may be requisitioned for next years' freshman class.

Tech Terrace Apartments has a hilarious website,79,24,"I hope that the [website](https://www.techterracetroy.com) for Tech Terrace is merely *unfinished*, because hoo boy!

[Enjoy this high-quality rendering of luxury student housing](https://i.imgur.com/FIMDO6G.png).

The floor-plans have some real gems.

Starting with the [one-bed apartment](https://i.imgur.com/AuR7don.png), everything looks okay..although the closet is apparently just an L-shaped wall.

The [two-bed apartment](https://i.imgur.com/2dTHMwn.png) is where things get spicy. Bedroom 1 is for ghosts only - no corporeal beings allowed! The washer/dryer combo is also only for spectral residents; mortals must wash their clothes in the sink.

The [three-bed apartment](https://i.imgur.com/tjZf7n2.png) is mostly sane, although bedroom three gets some kind of special ""double closet"" - and the unit has no entrance, which means that you'll need to bring your own door hole.

But the pièce de résistance - the cream of the crop - the magnum opus - is the [four-bed apartment](https://i.imgur.com/3kfNYLS.png).

* Bedroom 1 has no door
* Bedroom 2 has no door, and nowhere to conceivably *put* a door, other than behind the sofa. I suppose it has a secret entrance.
* Bedroom 3 has no door
* Bedroom 3's bathroom is open to the hallway. That's one way to ensure a communal atmosphere!
* Bedroom 3's bathroom has no door to the bedroom. This makes sense, since bedroom 3 is a ghost-only room, and a door there would let squishy mortals inside.
* Bedroom 4 has no door, but that's because it doesn't have a wall. It is an improvement...

The floor plans in general look like they were smashed together in fifteen minutes, with no actual doors denoted anywhere - just holes where doors should go - and some very weird asymmetries all around. Compare this to a [City Station](https://i.imgur.com/Lxmyrf8.png) floorplan, which has things like ""doors"" and ""symmetry"" 

I'm really quite baffled. The site looks *broken*, but they say they're accepting applications for Fall '19. It says I should add an application to my cart, and that there's an application fee, but I just submitted an application (it let me upload a powerpoint presentation instead of a completed application) without doing any of that.

They also don't seem to list rent anywhere on the site...

Anyone Else Move Into A Trashed Room?,84,23,"So I just moved into city station south.

I just moved in and I don't have cleaning supplies yet. b.) It's quite dirty. 

I know it's not there responsibility to clean the place for us but I thought they'd at least clean up after the last tenants. I really hope this is from Summer tenants and not from last Spring but judging from the smell I'm not so sure. It's full of junk, the fridge is full of run off from what looks like milk, soda, and food that's glued to the thing can hardly peel it off. The bathrooms and rooms are also full of junk, dust, and stains from who knows what. Both for school and out of school I'm used to apartments being at least clean if a little dusty when a new tenant moves in.

What's with all the arch surveys?,29,9," Hi everyone!

I'm currently serving as the Vice Grand Marshal and I'm also currently doing the Arch. I want to talk about the two Arch surveys that most of you have seen. One of them was sent by the Student Senate's Arch Task force (ATF) (I’ll refer to it as the first survey) and the other was sent by Institute Assessment and the Arch administrative team (I’ll call this the second survey).

To be completely honest, neither group knew the other was sending a survey and I'll take fault for the lack of communication on the student side.

Both these surveys aim to identify the core issues with Arch so that we can work to improve the Arch for future Arch students.. The ATF is trying their hardest to help improve the Arch. BUT... most of what they do is identify specific problems with Arch and take those to specific administrators that can help us to find a solution to the problem. One such example is identifying specific classes that shouldn’t be offered in 6 weeks (I’m looking at you LITEC). This example can be resolved by students communicating with professors and the administration. However, there are bigger issues that we are all seeing, such as the lack of support to find away opportunities or being forced to live on campus and be on a meal plan.These issues take a lot more time and communication to find a compromise. This is where these surveys become very important.

I, as one student/one voice, have certain opinions about my Arch Experience thus far. But my opinion in the grand scale is minuscule and won’t be a cause for any change. If any change is to be made, these opinions must carry some significant weight behind it when it is presented to the Administration. What I am getting at is that if a significant percentage of students participating in The Arch express their view in the form of a survey response, then we will be able to better articulate our concerns with the Arch program. Statistically, if there is not enough data to support a specific change than the survey results pertaining to that change will be discredited until there is enough data to support it. 

The two aforementioned surveys are pretty similar in their content, but there is one key difference. The one that was recently sent out to everyone via email comes straight from the administrators that deal with all things arch. This is not to say that the ATF one doesn’t make its way to the administration. What I am saying though, is the opportunity to present our views directly to the administration is rare, so we should take advantage of it when we can.

Long story long, I implore all of you (current arch students) to take the survey you got sent by email because the future success of the Arch program depends on it. The more responses we generate the more likely it is that changes will be made to the program. Responses are more likely to be validated if there is a high percentage of participation amongst current Arch students. So once you fill it out, please get all of your friends to fill it out as well!

In addition (this is not super official yet but something I think will be greatly beneficial for the future of student organizations), if you are a part of any student organization and you are going away from campus for your away semester, try to keep track of exactly how being away affects your involvement with your organization. At the end of next Spring (Spring 2020), there will be a survey recounting the whole Arch experience (after the semester away has been completed), and including that information about the impact on student organizations will play a huge role in helping Student Government, as well as the Office of Student Life, work towards solutions to help keep students involved in their organizations.

Pls take Arch survey, it will really help improve Arch!",cqb0iq,RPI

North + E-Complex Mice Infestation,137,16,"So.... I'm just wondering when the higher level administration are going to care enough to do something serious about the mice in North & E-Complex. (It seems like they are starting to pay more attention to this sub-reddit so I'm going to try and use it to my advantage!!) 

The ""Oh, I lived there previously and that's just how it is, you have to get used to it."" is really unacceptable to me. The residents and honestly everyone on campus pay too much money to just accept living with mice. In the \~2 weeks since we've been living in the dorms, at least every other day I am aware of a resident who sees a mouse in their room or catches one in a trap in their room. One resident in particular has caught SEVEN MICE in their room alone in the past week, and this is after the on campus exterminator made visits as well.

The absolute worse part is the response mechanism to handle this. I understand that after the flood the maintenance staff are overworked and short staffed. As far as I am concerned, this is an issue above them. If there is a maintenance emergency, more people should be hired short term to deliver the services we need on this campus and if you KNOW there is a mice infestation on campus you should hire at least a few on-call staff because no one should have to sleep with dead mice in their room from Friday evening to Monday morning... this poses a legitimate health and safety concern for residents in these halls. 

Ultimately, I'd like to see a legitimate extermination in these spaces over an extended break (boo-hoo if you can't house students there during Arch), dead mice everywhere is filthy, and the other concerns should be addressed in the meanwhile.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to budge the admin to address this issue, I'd love to hear them!",d03zu2,RPI
Wait Alcohol is banned in upperclass dorms?,110,21,"So I came here and checked into my room with a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey and a case of beer on my person. I keep a decent sized whiskey and spirits collection at home particularly North American made whiskeys. I don't bring most of it with me because I don't drink that often maybe just a bit in a glass once or twice a week with gaps of a few weeks where I don't drink except for a beer with dinner here or there. So we have our meeting and apparently alcohol is banned in City Station South. I don't recall ever reading simething like that. I thought alcohol was just banned in dorms where the residents are often under 21. What kind of commie shit is this? I've seen the admins drink at some ball not so long ago. This is some tyrannical nonsense. I pay my taxes and am of age. Not to mention the taxes I pay *on* *the* *whiskey*.

Nobody is gonna stop drinking. I'm certainly not. I have opaque locked containers how are they going to find it? Regardless the punishments are so severe. I've been at a few colleges with some of my friends who go to other schools. Usually they have educational stuff for the first few times you get caught where as RPI basically says yeet after the first time.

They run a fucking pub that let's you get intoxicated. They pace you. No one's getting proper fucked up. A bastion of drinking responsibly. I know I've gotten reasonably drunk there multiple times. They've served me upwards of 6 pints plenty of times. Why the hell not? Not like I do it every month at most maybe twice a semester. I'm not pissing myself or passing out I have at most 7 or 8 over about 2 hours with some friends and we all try different beers together and call it a night so we don't get blackout or get a bad hangover. It seems they understand adults can regulate themselves but just want us to have to pay the for the pubs overpriced beer.

# The Climate-Ready Home: Reimagining Domestic Infrastructure in Vulnerable Times

**Alison Kenner**, Associate Professor, Drexel University

Wed 10/30, 12:30 PM - 2 PM

CBIS (Biotech) Auditorium

*Preceded by ""Lunch for Livable Worlds"" at 11:00 AM at Evelyn's Cafe*

**Abstract:** The home can be thought of as a central node situated at the intersection of public-private infrastructures that include building stock, zoning laws, energy grids, lead pipes, and transportation systems among other sociomaterialities. As such, the home is a nexus of infrastructural vulnerability, which will be made more complicated -- most likely worse -- by climate change. This talk describes a Philadelphia-based project designed to address such vulnerability. Climate Ready Philly experiments with the idea of the ‘climate-ready home’, a paradigm used in Australian and U.S. contexts in various ways -- sometimes used to sell energy efficiency technologies, in other cases as a vulnerability index in policy arenas, and in still other contexts, to prompt households think about emergency preparedness. In Philadelphia, the climate-ready home paradigm has been used in community-based workshop and municipal planning meetings to discuss how legacy infrastructure produces different kinds of vulnerabilities. The project is designed to ask how existing carescapes might be reinvigorated by climate change in ways that open up possibilities for housing justice.

**Bio:** Alison Kenner is an associate professor of Politics and a faculty member in the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at Drexel University. Her research and teaching focus on environmental health problems in the United States, including the asthma epidemic, climate change, and urban development. Her first book, *Breathtaking: Asthma Care in a Time of Climate Change* (University of Minnesota Press, 2018) examined how the asthma epidemic is tackled as an environmental problem using personal technologies, environmental education, and embodied knowledge of air quality. Her new book project, *Made Vulnerable: Exposed Infrastructures and Politicized Futures*, looks at urban redevelopment in present-day Philadelphia, and highlights issues such as vacancy, lead contamination, flooding and green infrastructure, and gentrification. She established the Philadelphia Health and Environment Ethnography Lab in 2014 to  support student research, community engagement, and partnerships with local organizations. The Lab is a partner on a transnational air quality project funded by the National Science Foundation. Kenner is also the PI for Climate Ready Philly ([climatereadyphilly.org](http://climatereadyphilly.org/)), a community-based climate education workshop series hosted in neighborhoods across the city.

RPI Gothic,79,15,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard of Regional Gothic memes, but the idea is to write a list of weird or upsetting things that go on in the everyday life of someone living in \[place\] with a creepy, Twilight-Zone-style twist. I started writing this one last year, and my friends liked it well enough that I thought I'd share it with you. It's still an in-progress thing, as I'm only a sophomore, so feel free to add on! :)

  

Freshman year:

* You open your IEA binder. Inside you find nothing but Chem notes. You look through your Calculus notebook. Chemical equations cover the pages. You search your HASS folder for the latest assignment and pull out a completed Chemistry worksheet. You can’t remember ever going to your Chemistry class.
* You are working on your CAD assignment. It is due tomorrow. It is 1:30 AM. It is always 1:30 AM. Bleary-eyed, you stare at your laptop’s digital clock for a full ten minutes. You blink slowly. It is 1:30 AM.
* Day two of NRB week. You meet ten new people. Only one shares your major. She lives in a different dorm. She has not heard of your dorm. You meet twenty new people. You tell them where you are living; none of them live in your dorm. You are beginning to wonder if anyone lives in your dorm.
* The first day of school is tomorrow. You are already in a group chat with some other students on campus. As everyone makes their way to the field house for convocation, a car with its windows rolled down speeds past you. The car is full of people, people not much older than you. ""TURN BACK NOW! TURN BACK, BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE!"", they scream out the windows. Everyone laughs and continues forward. Still smiling, you follow them.
* You approach your dorm building. You can hear someone walking behind you as you scan your keycard and open the door. The footsteps follow you up the stairs. You scan your keycard again. The footsteps follow you halfway down the hall. Suddenly, they stop. You quickly glance behind you. There is no one there.
* You enter the bathroom with your bath caddy. You notice someone has left a bottle of body wash on the counter. You shrug and wash your face. After drying off, you open your eyes. There are two bottles of body wash on the counter.
* You are on your way to your first class of the day. The path to the bridge always appears shorter than it was the day before. Today you step outside and the bridge is in front of you. Where are the other dorms? Where are the wooden stairs? Dozens of students appear, coming from behind you, towards you, around you, and cross the bridge with blank faces. Blankly, you follow them.
* You are in three group chats. They are all on different apps.
* You put a load of laundry in one of the machines. It says it will be done in 36 minutes. You set your phone’s timer and go to your room. When you come back, the machine is still running. Your laundry will be done in 15 minutes. Confused, you look down at your phone and reset your timer for 15 minutes. You look back up. Your laundry will be      done in 17 minutes.
* You exit the shower. There are two bottles of body wash and a tube of toothpaste on the counter.
* Today is the career fair. Students you recognize are walking to class in business attire. Students you don’t recognize are walking to class in business attire. Tall, faceless figures in business attire pass you on the bridge.
* You are up late studying calculus. Your eyes are tired. You can hear sounds of construction coming from across the street. Why are they making so much noise in the middle of the night? It’s so late! It’s... You glance at the clock. It’s 1:30 AM. You turn back to your calculus textbook and read about Lewis dot diagrams.
* Nothing in Commons tastes real. You come to realize that nothing in Commons is real, not even you.
* The bus is late. It is delayed by 11 minutes. You wait. Buses going in the wrong direction pass you. Buses with no drivers pass you. Buses going to places you’ve never heard of pass you. You check the bus tracker app. The bus is delayed by 40 minutes.
* The squirrels are brave here. They dart across the path in front of you, jumping into bushes, tripping over themselves in their haste. Why are they in such a hurry?
* The weeks are blending together. You can remember neither what you did nor when you did it. You no longer have any concept of time.
* Everyone’s RA is different. Some are never in their room. Some are always in their room. A friend of yours went drinking with her RA. Another caught his RA smoking weed. Your friends laugh about these things. You sweat, wondering whether you should laugh about your RA’s fangs.
* You are in five group chats. Two of them have the same people.
* There are two bottles of Dove body wash, a tube of toothpaste, and a makeup sponge on the counter. The bathroom trash has been overflowing for two days; you cannot see the bin anymore. Q-tips are everywhere—on the floor, on the counter, in the sink, on the windowsill, in the showers.
* It’s a visitation day. You know this because the skies are blue, rather than their usual gray. As the seventh tour group you’ve seen today approaches, you suddenly get the unmistakable feeling of Shirley Ann Jackson watching you. You smile at the tour group as they pass.

Sophomore year:

* You have new emails about the ARCH. The ARCH is coming. The ARCH is coming. The ARCH is coming. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? You look at your junior friends. Something invisible in their eyes has broken.
* You have to take different routes to class now than you did as a freshman. There are many ways to get to the same building, but which route is the quickest? You try all of them and realize it does not matter. None of them are fast enough.
* You go to Commons for dinner. Everything about it looks different. As you sit down with your plate, surrounded by chattering freshmen, you wonder if you only dreamed that those horrid long tables existed. You take a bite of your food. Somehow, it hasn’t changed with everything else. Somehow, it still isn't real.",dbnbbx,RPI

"Prohibition of alcohol in greek houses, and during social events, will continue next semester. Rush will be allowed.",44,33,"December 21, 2018

To: The Rensselaer Community  
From: LeNorman J. Strong, Interim Vice President for Student Life  
Re: Greek Life Update

Throughout the fall semester, I have been paying specific attention to our Greek community's response to the efforts of the Greek Life Review, and compliance with the conditions put into place related to fraternity and sorority recruitment, rush, intake, and the presence of alcohol as detailed in the [June 26, 2018 letter to the community](https://info.rpi.edu/greek-life-task-force/communications/#ModificationofRestrictiononRushRecruitmentandIntakeActivities). As the Greek Life Review Committee continues to finalize its work, I have carefully considered how these conditions should apply in 2019.

I have discussed the impact these conditions and restrictions may have had on the system during the fall 2018 semester with students, faculty, alumni, and staff. In particular, we paid careful attention to recruitment numbers and reports of displaced alcohol abuse. 

The Panhellenic Council saw an increase in cumulative recruitment numbers this semester as compared to previous years. On the other hand, while some fraternities achieved success in their recruitment goals, the cumulative recruitment numbers dropped for Interfraternity Council (IFC) groups. 

Three IFC fraternities were placed on emergency suspension status for alcohol-related violations: Pi Kappa Phi, Phi Gamma Delta a.k.a. FIJI, and Pi Kappa Alpha. Following the judicial inquiry phase of the Rensselaer Judicial Process, these fraternities were found to be responsible for the alleged violations.

The safety of our students will always be a top priority. Our interventions, by way of the restrictions placed on alcohol and other drugs, have resulted in a safer campus community. There was a 45 percent reduction in alcohol-related incidents this fall, compared to the fall 2017 semester. There was also a noticeable reduction in Title IX/Sexual Misconduct cases.

After thorough consideration of all factors, the following actions are being taken:

* The system-wide pause on all social events with alcohol will continue;
* The system-wide ban on alcohol and other drugs from chapter houses and activities will continue;
* New member recruitment of all students may proceed in spring 2019, as planned by the IFC and Panhellenic Council.

Groups who take the risk of violating these restrictions are placing the future of their organizations in jeopardy of being shut down.  For those who have adapted and moved in a direction consistent with their organization's values, and the values of Rensselaer, I thank you. I also appreciate the guidance that has been offered by alumni, parents, and other chapter advisers, and advocates who have provided support to Greek Life organizations at Rensselaer. I'm looking forward to a safe and successful spring Greek Life recruitment.",a8ep9y,RPI

Updates to the Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities,17,2,"August 29, 2019

Dear Students,

Welcome to the start of the fall 2019 semester at Rensselaer. You will find this semester to be an exciting time for the Rensselaer community, with new opportunities for educational and social excellence.

In addition to welcoming you, I also write to make you aware of your rights and responsibilities as a Rensselaer student. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities reflects the values, beliefs, and expectations we have as a community of scholars. The Handbook is the centralized document which lays out both the rights and the responsibilities of students at Rensselaer to help ensure mutual respect, integrity, and an environment where all students can effectively pursue their educational goals.

It is the responsibility of each Rensselaer student to understand and comply with the rules and regulations set forth in the Handbook, as well as with the requirements set forth in other Institute policies and rules. Compliance with the requirements of the Handbook is also a condition of occupancy for all residents in campus housing–in addition to the contractual terms set forth in the room and board contracts and the policies of the Office of Student Living and Learning.

Updates Included in Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities, rev. August 29. 2019:
 
Gender-Neutral Pronouns

The Handbook has been updated to include the use of gender-neutral pronouns and language to actively reflect the value we place on an inclusive Rensselaer community through policies. The updates replaced pronouns such as he, him, his, and she, her, hers with they, them, their, as these are widely accepted as gender-neutral and inclusive pronouns. 
 
Tobacco Use and Smoking Policy

In an effort to continue to provide a healthy and safe environment for the Rensselaer community and our visitors, the Tobacco Use policy has been updated to include the prohibition of electronic devices which facilitate smoking, whether tobacco is used or not, including vaping. The name of the policy has been updated to include “smoking” to reflect these changes.
 
Hearing Boards

The structure of the Review Board, a body that serves within the Institute judicial process, with responsibilities to consider appeals of Grounds for Disciplinary Action violations, has been updated to include two staff administrators as a part of its membership. Review Board membership includes two students, two faculty members, and two staff administrators.
 
The description of the Greek Judicial Board has been removed from the Components of the Judicial System section of the Handbook. The purpose of the Greek Judicial Board is to hear complaints which pertain to potential violations of the Greek self-governing policies, set by the Interfraternity Council (IFC) or Panhellenic Council (PC) By-Laws, by a recognized fraternity or sorority. All Institute policies will be enforced by the Rensselaer Judicial System, which includes the Student Judicial Board which has responsibilities for considering cases involving the potential violation of Institute policy by any student or student group. The Greek Judicial Board will continue in its purpose to hear violations by fraternities and sororities of governing council bylaws and other policies.
 
Student Living and Learning Policies

A reference to Student Living and Learning Policies has been added to the Handbook to reflect the updated residency requirements and community expectations which are applicable to all students. The policy continues to require that all first-year students, second-year students, and students participating in The Arch summer semester, live in Rensselaer residence halls. It also now prohibits any Rensselaer student from living in the residence of a fraternity or sorority whose recognition has been revoked or suspended by the Institute, or is not formally recognized by the Institute.
 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

This policy describes the prohibition of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or “drones” over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute property, except where specifically authorized. Regulations of operation and procedures to seek permission are defined.
 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

The section, which describes the provisions under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), has been updated to include additional information about the policy that relates to circumstances in which the Institute is permitted to disclose educational records to parents or legal guardians of dependent students.
 
Solicitation and Distribution

A description of the solicitation and distribution procedures have been added to reflect existing processes for the distribution of materials on campus, as well as fundraising or solicitation activities. Instructions have been provided for student organizations to request approval for such activities.

If you or someone you know is in need of care and support services, please contact any of the resources below:

At Rensselaer, we are committed to creating a campus that is safe, supportive, and conducive to the growth and development of all members of our community. 

I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Handbook as the recent changes may have a direct impact on you. Should you have questions, please contact the Office of Student Living and Learning or the Dean of Students Office.

So I guess my questions are: is it a good idea to live that far from campus? Even though it is fairly close to a metro? Is there anyone who lived somewhat similar distances away from the campus? If so, what is your experience? Is it really difficult in the winter?

idk if mcgill is for me,73,53,"I come from a family that is very average, financially. We’re not rich, but we’re not poor either. Sending me to McGill was a big decision that definitely changed all of that, especially now because my family is in the process of moving houses. Like many of you, McGill was my first choice, so when I found out I was admitted, I practically begged my parents to let me attend here. They were completely against it for the longest time, especially since I am the youngest of my siblings, and they didn’t let either of them study out of province either. I basically spent my entire grade 12 year trying to convince them to say yes, and they eventually gave in near the end of my year and said yes.

Now, I am currently paying my tuition through student loans and am living off-campus with a relative. I wanted to live on rez to make friends but my parents completely cut that option out since it’s too expensive, so now I commute 40 minutes everyday to get to school.

Here’s the problem: I’m doing absolutely terrible in my academics right now. I failed one of my midterms, barely passed two of them, and did decent on the other two. Having done 2 finals so far, I feel like I may have failed my math 139 final, but hopefully the mark is not too low where I fail the course entirely. I still have two more finals, which I am deathly scared for and feel quite unprepared (yet here I am, ranting rather than studying for them lol). Similar to pretty much all McGill students, I scored very high in high school, which was one of the convincing factors to attain my parents’ trust to come study here. They have a lot of hope in me, which I am glad to hear, but it’s so stressful to hear it all the time. My mom, basically everyday would always tell me, personally, that she expects the most from me out of all of my siblings, and even more now because I was the only one allowed to leave the province to study.

Some more background info: Living off-campus affected me a lot. In high school, I was used to being surrounded by a group of friends every single day. Coming to McGill, I knew it would be slightly harder to make friends since I was not on rez, but I tried to think positive. I attended frosh but everyone in my frosh group were exchange students who were in their 20s and kept brushing me off whenever I tried to make a connection (I was 17). Then, I introduced myself to so many people in classes, labs, tutorials, etc. but it seemed as though everyone I met lived on rez and whenever they found out I was off-campus, they would sort of falter and find someone else to talk to. We would have great conversations, and then, as soon as they find out I’m off campus, they wouldn’t talk to me as much.

Being used to constantly being around people back in high school to barely talking to anyone took a big hit on my mental state. I eat lunch by myself everyday, alone and go to classes without anyone to talk to. Although it may not sound like a drastic problem compared to what others have to go through, but for me, it was a huge change and is still something I struggle to adapt with. Spending my 18th here, alone, was quite lonesome, especially because my relative wasn’t at home with me either.

I’d go weeks without having anyone to talk to and it kind of put me into a depressed mental state. And now, it seems like everyone already has their own, group of friends and aren’t as open to meeting new people as they were during the beginning of the semester.

I told my parents about my situation and they brushed it off, saying that this should help me get extremely good marks since I wouldn’t have any “distractions”, when in reality, having no friends was my distraction. It lead me to feel very depressed and insecure with myself, to the point where I started developing an unhealthy eating pattern. There would be days where I binge eat, and continue eating even though I could physically feel myself about to explode, and there would be days where I would barely eat anything. Sometimes I would just drink water and call it a day, and the entire process would repeat itself, over and over again.

I feel like having no friends was the sole reason as to why I’m doing so poorly in my academics. It lead me to being unmotivated to do anything. I will admit, some of the material that we have learnt is quite difficult, but had I been the same person I was back in high school, I would have continued to rigor through until I understood the content, but now, I’ve lost all of my motivation to even try. I began to be very behind in my courses, and thus lead to a terrible semester. I still never told my parents my midterm results, I’m too afraid to let them down. To make matters worse, I have dreams to go into medicine and I understand that this will definitely make my application not stand out compared to other applicants. My mom constantly mentions that I should come home and study there, but I’m unsure as to what I want anymore.

I want to stay at McGill because I was planning on staying with my relative for another year until I’ve saved enough to move out and really start on my life by myself, but if I were to go back home, my parents wouldn’t let me move out until I finish my degree, whether I have enough to move out or not. They’re sweet and protective, and I love them for that, but it gets quite overbearing, especially now when my mom expects me to facetime her every night, and when I call her an hour later than I normally do, she would start yelling at me. She always tells me to make sure I am home, latest, 9PM every night and that she doesn’t ever want me partying or going out for a small drink.

Now taking these factors into consideration, I don’t know if I should stay at McGill and complete my degree here or transfer to the university in my province for my 2nd year. I feel like I’m wasting so much money studying here because I am not doing well, academically, mentally and physically. If I go back home, I know I will be happier because my friends are there, but at the same time, I don’t think I will ever be able to feel proud of myself for not being able to stick it through. But again, I’m scared of failing and wasting so much money and time here if I am not going to be able to be successful in the end.

Sorry for ranting so long, I just really wanted to get this off my chest and get some good advice. :)",e9itv5,mcgill
On Campus Housing reviews,2,5,"Hi! I'm an International student, joining McGill this Fall for my Graduate Studies.

McGill’s dependency on Facebook,66,29,"I’ve been wondering this for the last three years i’ve been at this school, why is McGill so dependent on Facebook? the class groups, housing opportunities, club activities, everything seems to run on Facebook (not exclusively obviously, but you get what i mean). why can’t McGill make it so that we have class groups/chats and the other things on the McGill app? (imagining a future where the app works functionally). 

I’m not on Facebook or social media like that in general and I have been resisting to open a Facebook account just to be in the class groups or to be more involved with the community. Not that I’ve been feeling like I’m missing out on anything, although I’ve been told that I have, I find it weird that students would have to have an account on this public platform to get access to certain things just because the school has been so dependent on it.

Final Assessment of Quebec Financial Aid (AFE),8,3,"I have had to move out of my parents house due to danger to my health and safety.

Help with student housing in terrible condition,1,2,"Hi there! Bit of a long shot.. but my sister is having a problem with student housing and would love any feedback or help if anyone has experience here.

&#x200B;

So my sister, who is attending mcgill, is really stressing out because she just started her school year and she was put into student housing that was, quite honestly, not habitable.  She moved in about a month ago, and from the start everything was super duper dirty. Flooring, cupboards, the ceiling and shower rod was broken or cracking. Bugs and insects were all over the apartment, and more. :( I'm happy to share photos if needed. Being the young student that she is, she didn't realize that she should have rejected the room or file a written complaint within the first day of moving in. She did verbally talk to someone about issues with the room, but unfortunately I don't think she has a paper trail for it. That being said, she has been trying to get the maintenance team to fix things, but overall the apartment is still in terrible state. 

&#x200B;

I've tried contacting student housing through their website, but no one seems to want to help and keeps telling us to contact other people. And the people who are supposed to help are just saying we're out of luck because they don't have any other units and/or we didn't tell them within 24 hours of moving in. Has anyone had any experience getting moved to another unit or getting a unit fixed up completely? If so, do you have any tips on who to contact to get things done?

I visited my family abroad after a long time, now I feel more alone than ever.

To add to the loneliness, I'm not taking a single class with any of my ""classmate"" friends. I am alone in every class I go to. It hurts but focusing on the lectures takes my mind off it.

I developed a habit of waking/sleeping early and I am able to hit the gym regularly. I actively try to eat healthy and take care of myself but what for?

Hell I even went on a first date ever recently, popped the cherry right after and am currently seeing her. Always feels great being with her but there's still a little bit of emptiness inside and I just pray it doesn't leach into her life.

Best Housing Options?,7,22,"Hi! I'm an incoming freshman and today I went on the unofficial McGill guide only to see that the website had expired :( I'm hoping the mods will make a thread for housing options, because I've seen a lot of people struggle with choosing a residence. 

I would want to have a single room in a few that is quiet enough to study in, but also is quite social and throws parties once in a while. I don't want to live in Solin because it's too far from McGill. I'm vegan so I was wondering if McGill had some cafeterias with good vegan options. If so, which rez has the best vegan food and if not, I'll just live in a more house. I'm also interested in working on campus at McGill. I'm a US student and I don't speak French, although I want to learn it. McGill says that students that qualified for an entrance bursary can get campus jobs pretty easily. Is that true?

Edit: So it seems that as a vegan, the best option would be to live in a rez where meal plans aren't required. With that in mind, what are the pros and cons of living in a more house or at Solin hall?

Edit 2: Thanks for all the advice! I'm going with what most people recommended and picking Solin as my residence :)",64ocse,mcgill

Best Internet for gaming?,5,12,"Hello everyone,

I just moved to Montreal & am living in a communal house which is great. We share internet, but one of the guys told me that I should be careful with gaming so I don't ""use up all the internet"". I lived in dorms (US) & a house before this, and never had to worry about the amount of internet usage my gaming does. I rarely watch Netflix or stream... I just like to play Xbox with my friends in the USA.

Financial Aid Dilemma,7,21,"Hey guys

&#x200B;

Soooooo... here's the entire story.

I applied to McGill in December 2017, was rejected (lord knows why), and then accepted late after a reconsideration request at the end of June 2018. I immediately paid my enrolment deposit, got an allotment in Solin hall, and paid the housing deposit of 1500$. I also applied for the CAQ and study permit.

Since I was accepted late, there were only two months left until classes started and the time to get the study permit in my country is around 4-6 months. While I waited anxiously, September came but no study permit so I had no choice but to send in a deferral request to the winter term. I had to inform the housing department of this change too and they said I could join Solin and get my deposit back when I arrive in January.

&#x200B;

But then I was told that there was no space in the engineering faculty for the winter and the only place McGill had for me was in Fall 2019. 

&#x200B;

During all this, my country's economy went to shit and the local currency devalued hard. Since all my family's savings are in our local currency, the cost to attend McGill has effectively increased by 50% plus the tuition for 2019-2020 also increased. I applied for the entrance bursary but they rejected my application even though ALL of my family's savings BARELY cover the cost for the 4 years of attending McGill. And this is assuming all of that money is used on me but I have siblings, their school costs, and there are obviously other living expenses to factor in. I called service point but they said unless there's any new information, the decision won't be changed.

&#x200B;

Yet another setback, I emailed the housing dept about getting the deposit back since I can't afford to live on campus anymore but they said it can't be refunded due to the cancellation policy even though I tried to explain that I never voluntarily cancelled and was instead forced due to the extenuating circumstances. Now, 1500$ is fucking A LOT. Add that to the crippling debt I'd be going into.

&#x200B;

So now here I am, committed to McGill since June 2017, but can't afford the total cost. Is there anything at all I can do, anyone I can speak to? I've tried contacting the aid office asking to get a chance to explain my situation but I only get a one-line answer of the policies.",bawkit,mcgill

Hi! Thanks for spamming all of McGill today.

>We're contacting you guys today to see if any of you would be a good fit to work with us as a pillar in our startup.  
>  
>Sadly, we are under a non-disclosure agreement so I won't be able to share all the details with you in this message. Of course, if you get to the interview, we will explain the project in details after you'll have signed the NDA.

""If you get to the interview""

Are you really not going to say any details about your super secret stealth startup?

>What can be told for now is that we're working on a truly groundbreaking online platform, something with great potential which has never been done before, at least, not in the way we want it to be. We also want to have investors before the end of May. So here is exactly what we need:

Of course its truly 'ground breaking'. Investors by the end of May? Are you also planning to pitch on Dragon's Den?

>A web developer who's not afraid to improvise, who's competent and who has a great sense of design and user experience. The person we choose will have to create our platform from scratch and run it (databases, security, bug fixes, etc). This, of course, doesn't exclude the use of Stack Overflow, templates and other tools. We're not psychopaths. 

You LITERALLY don't know what web development is.

Web developer != Database engineer != Security engineer != Designer != UX engineer

>To see if you have the skills necessary, ask yourself: ""Could I build a website similar to Airbnb in appearance and functionality using everything at my disposition?"" If the answer is yes, you're good enough.

What the fuck. Airbnb has over 1000 engineers. The only person who would say yes to this question is as psychotic as you.

>Skills are good, but the most important thing for us for is passion. We want someone who is ready to invest him/herself in our project completely and be as driven by it as we are. We're looking big and won't stop before we're on top. If this is the spirit you want in your work and if you've always been looking for a startup to be a part of, you're the person we're looking for.

What does MLM mean? 

>As said before, you'll play a major part in our startup and we are looking for the long-term. This is why the chosen candidate will receive shares of the company. We'll work as a team and we want everyone to gain true value for their work in the long run. The team spirit is also crucial to us, so we're looking for someone friendly with a great sense of humor (if you're a Game of Thrones fan, write it in your motivation letter. This is a big plus).

Shares don't pay the bills. Long term with no pay... your developers are going to be so happy. Wow I have the opportunity to watch GOT with you? I'd rather not

>If you're interested, ready to jump in as soon as possible and think you have the right characteristics, please send us a motivation letter with your portfolio. We also ask for your CV but we are far more interested in your personality and the quality of your work. You can send everything to [\[REDACTED\]@gmail.com](mailto:redacted@gmail.com) .

What the fuck is a motivation letter? And a CV is necessary? And a portfolio? You don't even have a company email bro

>If you pass the first selection round, we'll contact you for a live interview as soon as we can. The sooner you can start, the better.  
>  
>TL;DR: If you're a skilled web developer who wants to invest yourself in a groundbreaking startup, be a part of a fun team and be able to create something truly great which will bring value to thousands of people, be paid not by your time but by the quality of your work over the long-term, if you're tired of letting your life pass you by and want to take control of it by using your skills to create something truly yours which you'll be really proud of, send us your motivation letter, portfolio and CV. If we we think you'd be a good fit, we'll set up an interview for you to learn more about the project and for us to make our final choice.

Actual TLDR: If you're a skilled web developer who wants to burn out while working for a psychopath business student with an unnamed idea for fake money, apply to this company.

Advice For Choosing A Rez (First Year Student),6,32,"Hey everyone! I'm an incoming first year student and I'm super excited to attend McGill! I'm currently looking at different Rez options for first year students and I just wanted to pop on here for some help picking one out. For the record, I know that this is something that I shouldn't be concerned about yet but it's exactly -32(c) degrees right now, windy enough to topple our garbage bins, and I haven't been able to leave my house these past 2 days. So I've pretty much been thinking about nicer things, what I'm trying to find at McGill, and also possibly developing senioritis in the process because I want to get the *hell* out of here and explore Montréal.

&#x200B;

I looked over the Rez Masterpost and other posts about Rez (rez stereotypes, memes, etc.), so I have a general idea of what each Rez is like. Ideally, what I'd like to have is a dorm with a strong learning-oriented community, fun (not drinking-heavy) traditions, and good study places/practice rooms for non-music majors (if such a thing exists). I'm not into partying or drinking but I am into having dinner parties with friends, seeing a Montreal Symphony Orchestra concert, etc. Could anyone point me to a dorm that might fit my tastes?

&#x200B;

I have no preference over community stalls vs. private bathrooms, campus location (edit: I'm not ruling out Solin now), or the cafeterias, hence why I've been having a difficult time trying to pick out a few places from the rest. Since my preferences come down to the kinds of people each dorm normally attracts, the quality of the study rooms/accessibility of practice rooms, and the quirky traditions each dorm might have, I'm pretty much searching for as much advice I can get from people who've already been through Rez life/are currently in Rez. So yeah, any advice and cool stories will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Also, as much as I dislike that the food and dorms are wayyyy overpriced, I would feel a lot more comfortable in a dorm for my first year. Plus, even with the super overpriced stuff McGill is actually considerably cheaper than my 2nd choice school (America and overpriced tuition/housing! Yay!) But I'd definitely appreciate any advice finding an apartment for my upcoming years. I heard that Montréal is very tenant-friendly in addition to having cheap rent so that's a plus.",al8dvt,mcgill

Spanish and Latin American Student Association responds to the Daily article on the Venezuelan Crisis,93,102,"Quoted from the Spanish and Latin American Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/SLASA.Mcgill/posts/3005536146138471?__tn__=K-R

""Public Statement: Spanish and Latin American Student Association (SLASA)
February 22, 2019

After reading the commentary on Venezuela published by the McGill Daily this past Monday, linked below, and listening to the Venezuelan student and alumni members of our community, we, the Spanish and Latin American Students Association of McGill University (SLASA), publish the following public statement:

The Venezuelan community has made it clear that they were deeply offended, hurt, and angered with the opinion published by the Daily. This opinion transmitted a self-indulgent tunnel-vision approach that is reflective of a small group with big voice on campus. Despite not being from the region in question, they have made it their prerogative to say that they don’t want foreign intervention while intervening in others’ affairs themselves.

This opinion piece fails to recognize that the people of Venezuela are capable of organizing their own path towards democracy by characterizing the current events as an undeniable coup. Speaking about the sovereignty of a country in such a reductive and arrogant way is one of the factors that has most enraged the Venezuelan community in McGill. The rhetoric of the Daily stimulates misconceptions by portraying the current political crisis in Venezuela as a scenario of left against right, when the real conflict that the people in the country are facing is a battle of tyranny against oppressed citizens.

The Daily published their opinion with quotation marks around the words humanitarian crisis. We’re not going to assume what they suggest by this, but want to clarify that what is going on in Venezuela is a tragedy. Millions of Venezuelan citizens living in the country are suffering one of the greatest humanitarian crisis in the history of Latin America. The facts speak for themselves: 87% of Venezuelans are below the poverty line and 52% of families can’t afford to meet their basic food needs. Furthermore, this crisis has generated a huge outflux of emigration, affecting neighbouring countries in the region. It is estimated that 3 million people have had to leave their home, much of them having to walk unfathomable distances in order to find refuge in neighbouring countries. We stand with our Venezuelan brothers and sisters as they face a dreadful period in their history.

Among the many inaccuracies the commentary had, the most significant misinterpretation was the false conclusion that the Maduro regime is somehow legitimate. One of the many examples of the fraudulent road to presidency for Maduro comes from the extortion used by the government in the electoral process. In January 2017, the Maduro regime issued a type of identification card called El Carnet de la Patria. This card is necessary for food handouts and it is used for voting. Maduro regime and its widely monopolized media sources has the Venezuelan population convinced that they can monitor who you voted for. This method implicitly held many Venezuelans to an ultimatum: vote for Maduro, or you do not get a government handout (which many people rely on for their livelihoods). Furthermore, popular opposition members (represented by the MUD party) were actively excluded from the race (such as Leopoldo Lopez being placed on house arrest or Henrique Capriles being disqualified from running), foreign election observers were not allowed to take part in the election process, and voter fraud were some of the many reasons that opposition members decided to boycott the May elections. In fact, the elections had an 80% abstention rate and they were admitted as fraudulent by Smartmatic (the Venezuelan voting system). All these arguments, among others, led the National Assembly and a great portion of the international community to declare that the election process fell short of the democratic guarantees necessary to be deemed legitimate as prescribed by article 350 of the Venezuelan Constitution.

The Daily gears their publication to support the ideals of a regime that has cost millions of Venezuelans their livelihoods. Nicolas Maduro’s election, unlike the Daily suggests, was in fact illegitimate. This is not a right-wing conspiracy, nor is it an intervention (in fact, Juan Guaido’s party, Voluntad Popular, is a member of Socialist International). Among many reasons, the May 2018 elections were illegitimate because the Maduro dictatorship blockaded opposition party members from actively participating in the Venezuelan elections.

The fact the elections were rigged and illegitimate means that when Nicolas Maduro’s previous term ended on January 6 there was a power vacuum, constitutionally requiring the National Assembly to swear in the President of the assembly as the new interim president of the Republic (as stipulated by article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution). This is important: Guaido was sworn in as president (and not a ‘self-proclamation’ or ‘constitutional coup’, as the Daily suggests). The published commentary used out-of-context facts to come up with blatantly false conclusions about the political atmosphere of Venezuela.

More so, Guaido’s intention has never been to establish himself as leader for the rest of the presidential term. Guaido identified three main goals as President of the National Assembly: 1) to cease the usurpation of the government by the Maduro regime, 2) to establish a transitory government, and 3) to establish fair and legitimate elections. Guaido’s call for elections is the best attempt to establish democracy the country has had in recent years. The Daily’s blatant falsehoods are a mockery to the greatest hope for democracy that the Venezuelan community has had in over a decade. This opinion piece is a prime example of careless journalism.

We would also like to mention that The Daily reached out to us before the commentary was published asking for our opinion on the events in the last month. We directed them toward a Venezuelan member of the community. However, neither his opinion nor the one of any other Venezuelan was represented in this opinion piece.

We would like to remind The McGill Daily about the implications that this type of journalism has had in Latin America. Historically, our countries have been dominated by small groups of people that always imposed their thoughts and prescribed on us their ideas, from both sides of the political spectrum, implying that we were ignorant and lacked agency. This traces back to the beginning of the colonies in the 16th century way up to the policies that pushed the United States of America to meddle in the sovereignty of Latin American nations in the 20th century and the communist insurgencies of Sendero Luminoso in Peru in the 1990s. This power dynamic is condescending and outright offensive, as it belittles our agency, our capacity of independent thought, and our dignity.

For the mockery that the Daily made of the Venezuelan crisis and inconsistent conclusions that the commentary made, we call on the Daily to issue an apology to the Venezuelan members of our community and to withdraw both printed and online copies of this irresponsible piece of journalism.

SLASA is open to answer any questions or concerns you may have.

With a message of support and love to our Venezuelan brothers and sisters,

Looking for suggestions/advice on what to do for housing situation with upcoming renewal,1,9,"Hi everyone. Guess I want to sort of bounce my thoughts here and have someone comment on anything that might help me out

Theres  a renewal coming up in September for another 12 months on my place, However I am potentially going to graduate in Dec (potentially might be able to work/stay until April, not sure of beyond that). Talked to my building manager about this and my obvious options are to try to sublet/lease transfer at whenever I need to go, and another option is he could try to talk to the owner and get my renewal down to 8 months.

So obviously given my graduating scenario, this 8 mo thing is tempting, but I wonder am I shafting myself if I try to get lowered from 12->8 mo? At the moment only disadvantage I can think is:

* If for some reason I do stay past end of April (either more work or study, or getting a job in mtl), I'll need to likely move out or renew, depending on length of stay, which brings me to my next point

* Location and unit is pretty nice, all things considered, may suck having to leave it if I do have to stay (but, again, staying is not that likely beyond april, based on information I have now)

Doing 8 mo would also save me trouble of finding sublet/lease transfer. Am I thinking too much about 'what ifs'?

Anyway after writing all this out, I guess I want to ask, any other pro/cons of trying for a 8mo vs 12mo in my situation?

thanks",4jxr5q,mcgill
incoming out of province Grad student for winter semester... how difficult is it to find housing?,4,21,"Ideally i'd like to live alone in a studio/bachelor or something like that. my budget is around ~$500-$600.

What is the housing market like for the winter semester?,1,5,"Hello McGillians, does anyone have experience looking for housing with leases starting in January? I'm on co-op until then, and plan on staying a full year from January-December. 

I'm wondering what time frame is best to look for housing, for example with May leases it's best to search in February and March. 

I feel like searching later could be beneficial because landlords might be more desperate to get someone to sign a lease during a less than popular time to start one. On the other hand, it may be better to look earlier because there could be way less selection in housing starting in January. 

Does anyone have experience with this?",51hb30,mcgill

UBC vs McGill for Life Sciences??,4,5,"I am a BC resident who lives in Vancouver and is trying to decide between going to McGill and UBC for sciences. I took IB in grade 11 and am doing Chem HL and Bio HL certificate (personal reasons for dropping to cert) and have a 95% average. I potentially want to go to med school, but understand that I may find another passion and that Medicine is the stereotypical go-to. I have already decided I do not want to go to U of T due to its extremely competitive reputation and grade deflation as well as huge class sizes. Just as a side note, I would live on residence either way so the cost is very similar.

&#x200B;

For McGill, I can speak French pretty fluently and I believe it would be an amazing experience to travel somewhere new and experience a different culture. McGill has a work hard/ play hard reputation that I kind of like but am a bit introverted (ie I like my own time and space every once in a while and am not super into partying in high school) so I'm not sure about it. Being from Vancouver, the weather seems pretty rough (I like to do outdoor activities like walking, running, skiing etc). However, its reputation is excellent and not many people from my high school go (I'd say less than 10 with a graduating class of over 400), which appeals to me for some reason in comparison to the many many many that go to UBC (i think more kids come from my HS than any other). McGill also seems to have a greater school spirit. I think a new experience would be good for me and would push me out of my comfort zone. I am planning to visit in the spring to see if I enjoy the campus environment.

&#x200B;

For UBC, I love the campus and the fact that I would live in rez, far enough that I wouldn't have to deal with my parents but also close enough to visit and spend some time. I do however live 20 minutes away, know the city and many people who go there which would be within my comfort zone. I am a bit interested in Greek life (my mom was in a sorority and has talked to me about what a great experience it was for her when she went to UBC) and UBC's is far more prevalent than McGill's. The UBC residences and food also seem nicer and newer than McGill's but I feel like there is a lack of community in comparison to McGill (IDK if this is right please let me know). I also like that at UBC I would have access to the mountains, beach and forest. UBC also seems to have a good student support network. However, it would be really hard to get residence for the second year and with Vancouver housing prices I may have to move back home (which I do not want to do!).

&#x200B;

Some other factors I have thought about are the gyms, intramurals and different clubs, class size, grading difficulty, travelling abroad and coop opportunities, but have not done enough research into either school to find info on them. Finally, I realise in my comparison that I have not focused on academics to a great extent but this is because I have heard such different things from different people and feel like I will get an excellent education at either institution.

Student housing has been an actual literal nightmare for me.

Reminder for those moving into housing or apartments: PERSONALIZE YOUR SPACE!,115,10,"I listened to an amazing lecture from UC Irvine (I can't find it, but I'll keep trying) that stated a study that showed people that personalized and maintained their living spaces were far more likely to stay in school and perform better, while those that did not had significantly higher rates of failure and dropping out.

&nbsp;

It's not to say that personalizing your space is the key to receiving a good grade and doing well in class, but it can help with your emotional well being to sort of ""project"" yourself onto the world around you and make a space ""yours"".

&nbsp;

I know it's so easy to remain indifferent and apathetic and to lose interest in the material world, or to see it as superficial and meaningless, but it's so important to realize that *we* define what has meaning and what has value in this world, for ourselves.


&nbsp;

 It's really hard to care about life and find success when we hold on to this attitude that nothing matters, so start the school year off right by inserting yourself into your surroundings. Put up posters and symbols and representations of the the things that are important to you on the walls and furniture. Bring some things that remind you of home and/or loved ones you'll be seeing less. For example, I'll be bringing several of my favorite rocks I've found, a blanket that has pictures of my dogs, a physics posters, bandanas of maps from places I've gone back packing to pin on the wall, and a bunch of other stuff.


&nbsp;


Whatever it is, try to make your space look more like a manifestation of yourself, rather than a prison cell, and try to carry that attitude with you where ever you can. You and your life and your future are important, and if you act that way, you will begin to feel that way.",d7bga5,ucdavis

Stuck in Cow Town - and shit sucks.,27,9," This campus is too large to make friends easily, and even with friends, it's impossible for everybody to make enough time to have healthy relationships in my group because we are all undergrad stem majors who don't know how to manage time and grades.

Academically, I can barely handle the minimum unit requirement. The mindset in lecture halls feels like a ""don't ask a question unless you know you're right"" one. Along these same lines, ive found students in my major (ANS) to be competitive to a point of pushing me down mentally to step ahead. I don't feel comfortable stating that I don't know an answer anymore. All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor.

For now I’m just searching for people who are interested in rooming together as I need to read more into the process.

About me, I’m a Neurobio, physio, and behavioral major transfer who is currently striving towards medical school (possibly pharmacy or PA if things don’t pan out). My favorite shows include Psych, Brooklyn 99, Rick & Morty, and Planet Earth II. I feel like I’m just above average cleanliness, and just below average socialness starting at a new school. Likely will try to spend most of my time studying, and doing some school extra currics.And I actually haven’t visited the Davis campus yet.

Looking for others in the same pre-med boat, but not a requirement. Other desired qualities: relative cleanliness, not super loud past 2am, and some interest in going to the gym.

DO NOT Live at West Village,79,48," TLDR AT END  


I know most of you probably have housing by now but I figured I would still post this rant.

West Village is nothing short of a scam used to  siphon even more money from students. It’s overpriced, and not even  luxurious for the price you pay. Even if you have to live somewhere else and buy your own furniture, it’ll still be cheaper than this shithole.  It’s just not worth it, even if money is not an issue.   


Pros  
\- Decent gym(s) that are closer than ARC. No squat racks though  
\- Pool areas are nice   
\- Study areas   
\- Direct bus line  
\- The Hub (I guess??)  
\- In unit washer/dryer  
\- Game area  


Cons   
\-  You PAY TO PARK: I was trying to get parking after moving in and the  only place available was a 10 minute walk away from my house. Even  though there were tons of empty spots near my place, they were only I  was pretty mad because I was already paying so much to live there. I  tried to tell the lady It wasn’t fair, and she just gave me attitude.  Luckily one of the office ladies were nice and helped me find a loophole  by buying tandem spots that they weren’t technically supposed to give  to one person. Seriously... I shouldn’t have to park where I live as a  student anyway. That’s just stupid.   
\- SHITTY OFFICE STAFF: The  office staff suck. Going off the first point, a lot of the office staff  here are really dumb. The first person I had contact with in order to  try to get my lease replacement figured out was incredibly bad at  communication. He took forever to respond to emails about it. He finally  sent me a bunch of forms to fill out. After that he told me the forms  were wrong and that my mom had to fill out a couple pages. The worst  part is, the office RARELY picks up phone calls. Most times, calling the  office leads straight to voice mail because they’re “busy.” This made  the whole move in process quite difficult. On top of all this, the staff  are kind of unprofessional and would sometimes have random  conversations with themselves when you’re there trying to get help.  Every time you want to talk to an office member in person, be ready to  wait 5-15 minutes for them to be done working with others before you.   
\-  DIRTY ON MOVE IN: The apartment was DIRTY AF when I got it. I mean  seriously: dirt was absolutely caked on in a lot of places. The ceiling  fan and the bathroom were the worst. Dirt all over the baseboards and  weird yellow splotches on the bathroom door. Multiple other reviewers  have said this on different websites and it’s totally true. They even  had the gall to charge me $130 dollars for cleaning after I moved out  even though I had cleaned all that mess up.   
\- ROOM SIZE: The  apartment room isn’t that big. You can look for yourself according to  square footage within Davis, but you’re honestly going to save a lot and  get a better room in either north or south Davis by just moving into a  different complex and buying some used or IKEA furniture. On top of  that, your bedroom will still be bigger. Sure you might add a couple  minutes to your bike ride, but even West Village is a 10 minute bike  ride from Main campus. Not nearly as close as Sycamore Lane etc.   
\-  PARKING TICKETS: TAPS keeps a very constant eye on the entirety of West  Village. If you accidentally park in your neighbors spot, get ready to  cough up $60. If someone else parks in your spot, and you park in the  adjacent one that you know is empty—guess what? Ticket. I’ve even had  someone take my spot a couple times and not get a ticket while I have.  Oh, and if you have a permit, you’re not even supposed to park on the  street because of some weird rules UC Davis has on the land. Only at WV  can you get a ticket for parking in front of your house in Davis.   
\-  ANTS: Oh yea, even though these buildings are relatively new, we had a  major ant problem in our apartment. They were crawling out of the wall  and from the back of the sink. Luckily the maintenance staff are  actually very nice and took care of it, but I really didn’t expect that  type of problem when I was paying $1100+ to live there  
\- OVERPRICED:  The price. Just wow. The amount of stuff you get is nowhere what you pay  for. You get some furniture and a TV, yes, but is it really worth it?  Probably not, especially if you’re not the type to use the game room or  pools very often.   
\- SECURITY DEPOSIT: I was charged $130 for ""no  attempt to clean,"" which was insane because I cleaned the place myself  and it was in way better condition than I got it. When I tried to talk  to the lady calling me about final payments, she was super rude and even  accused me of breaking the lease just because I wasn't staying there  over the summer. If you ever do live here, make sure to notify them  within 48 hours that your room was dirty or they give 0 shits.

Housing Guide for Freshman,40,18,"I've been seeing quite a few posts from incoming freshman about the pros and cons of living in different places around campus so I figured I would write a little guide based on my own personal experience. I'm only familiar with the major residence halls in central/west campus so other current students, please feel free to cover anything I missed in the comments.

Suite Style Dormitories:

Bragaw- This dorm is known as the alpha dorm because of its room size and location. It is right between Sullivan/Lee and the Tri-Towers, which makes it closer to main-campus than Sullivan/Lee and closer to Fountain than the Tri-Towers. The room sizes are easily the biggest with more than enough room to walk around in. Common rooms are centralized, so everyone in Bragaw uses the same ones. The two keys you receive open the suite and your room, which means you don't need a key for the bathroom. The biggest warning I have for people wanting to live in Bragaw is that the rooms are dank (the bad dank). I know lots of people who got really sick (pneumonia or flu) due to roaches and humidity. Therefore I'd definitely recommend installing a dehumidifier and roach traps in the room. Eight people share one bathroom, which has one shower and two stalls. It is easiest to get in through applying for eco-village.

Sullivan/Lee- These dorms are located in the far west area of main-campus, meaning a 6-8 minute walk to get to the Free Expression Tunnel and Talley. The rooms seem to be a little bit bigger than in Tri-Towers, but are still smaller than Bragaw. One of the biggest pros over both the Tri-Towers and Bragaw is that they have a common room with a kitchen on every other floor, something to value if you like cooking your own food. The two keys that you get to live there open your suite and your room, which means you don't need a key for the bathroom. These dorms are right next to Fountain Dining Hall. Eight people share one bathroom, which has one shower and two stalls. Sullivan is said to be the new home of the Engineering Village.

Tri-Towers(Bowen, Metcalf, Carrol)- These dorms are located in the heart of campus and are where I stayed freshman year. Their location is the biggest pro and outweighs many of the cons living here. Tri-Towers are the closest of these dorms to main-campus, meaning you are closest to Talley, Case (the legendary dining hall), Carmichael gym, and your classes while still being close to Fountain. The rooms are the smallest of the suite style halls; however, it is still easy to get a futon in and get a decent living situation going. These dorms are the best maintained. Ten people share a bathroom so two showers and two stalls. Now for the cons. There is only one common room at the bottom of the towers. Lots of people on Reddit say it feels like being in jail and I definitely get that vibe sometimes (depending on how depressed I'm feeling, lol). The two keys you get are for your bathroom and your room WHICH IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING, whether it's having guests over or just having to use the bathroom.

Hall Style Dormitories:

Tucker/Owen- These dorms are located right in front of the Tri-Towers and are on the same quad/volleyball court, so they share the same locational pros. The rooms are around the same size as Sullivan/Lee AND HAVE A SINK. That fact alone makes me wish I considered hall-style at NC State. The biggest thing people hold against hall style is having to share a bathroom with a whole hall, but from what I've heard it is not a big deal whatsoever. Shower availability is not a problem. It is also very easy to meet lots of new people in hall style, especially during that first-week college buzz.

I hope this helps anyone with questions and I wish everyone luck on their endeavors here at state. Go Pack!

P.S. Be as active and social as you can that first week! College has the stereotype of a place where you make tons of friends and while that's true, cliques/friend groups form very fast.

Edit: Sullivan/Lee common room correction, Engineering village correction",altpya,ncsu

Attention to ladies in their 20s: be aware of a card scam in the mail.,67,4,"You might receive a pink greeting card envelope in the mail. I thought it was a baby shower invitation. When you open it, a card inside says, “Holy guacamole! You’re going to avo baby!” Then inside is a handwritten note with ink smudges that says, “Congratulations!!! I’m so excited for you! I hope you like these. ♥️, Jenny B.” Then several giftcards and coupons are inside. The coupons even look like they were cut by hand out of a magazine.  
  
I’m a 20-something lady and I’m not pregnant. Several women all over the United States have received these in the past week. It is a scam. The giftcards are to a website run by one person selling extremely cheap goods, and almost all of the profits on these sorts of sites are made from shipping costs, which would require your credit card info.  
  
Unfortunately, many letters are being sent to older addresses you used to live at, like your parents house. If your parents open it, they might think you’re pregnant and haven’t told them, which fucking sucks.  
  
If you get one of these, do not use the giftcards, go to the website, or give the giftcards to pregnant friends. 

You can read more about the questionable business practice [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/who-is-jenny-b-pregnant-cards-letter-mothers-lounge-a9168591.html?amp), google “Jenny B card scam”, and see several threads on reddit.

How to go about exchange housing for one semester only?,2,3,"Hi all, 
I am an incoming exchange student for the fall (2019) semester. Due to the fact that I'll be studying at graduate school, I am not eligible for any on-campus housing. Finding options off-campus is not a problem, however, finding them for one semester only is. 
Therefore I wondered how realistic it is for me to sign a yearly lease and sublet between January and August. 

Because I know someone with the same problem, I could rent a shared room or a private room with two people that would both leave, depending on what would be easier to sublet. 

Please do tell me if there are way better options than the one I'm currently considering. As far as I can tell, this is a decent manner to live in a building with other students for not much more than 600 dollars a month, but I might be wrong.

Campus housing during winter break,17,5,"So I live in Yudof and I’m leaving for break tomorrow back to the TC suburbs, but I was wondering if anyone knows if it’s still possible to come back and get stuff during winter break?

Questions about Housing,16,17,"Hey!

So, I've never been to the Twin Cities. I've never been on campus, either. Visiting later in November. So I'm kinda lost about all of this. But to my knowledge, housing for Fall 2019 opens soon (November 1st?) so prospective students should put in a deposit asap.

I was wondering, what hall should a freshman attending the CLA (psych major) apply for? Is there one hall in particular that's closest to CLA buildings?

I'm kinda a quiet, nerdier type--not too big on sports, but I don't mind them, either. Are there halls with different personalities and stuff?

Also--are roommates randomly assigned? Or can you get matched with similar people? It'd be cool to be boarded up with someone who has a couple of mutual interests. Also, I'm lgbtq and don't want to make a random roommate uncomfortable by that fact. 

Thanks so much!",9q510q,uofmn

"Dear Sam Reschke,",19,1,"Could you seriously stop leaving your business adverts all over the floor here in Centennial?

It's getting really annoying and isn't how businesses or companies not affiliated with the University are allowed to advertise. 

In residence halls (like Centennial), external organizational businesses and companies are to advertise using the following:

#  Bulletin Boards

All residence halls/apartment complexes have open-posting bulletin boards and information tables in the lobby for non-University businesses and organizations. Addresses and contact information are listed under the ""Halls & Apartments"" tab at the top of this page. Housing & Residential Life cannot sell or distribute addresses (including email addresses) to non-University businesses and organizations.

Instructions for bulletin board content:

* Mail or drop off **ONE** 8.5 x 11 inch flyer at the information desk of each building.
* After hall staff approval, the flyers will be posted by staff members based on available bulletin board space.
* Typically, flyers will stay up for 2-4 weeks, depending on the quantity of other flyers and demand for bulletin board space.

# Information Tables

All residence halls/apartment complexes have an **information table where businesses** and organizations may place brochures, flyers, and **business cards** at the discretion of hall staff. **Please drop off brochures, flyers, and business cards at the building's information desk**. Typically, information tables are cleared of all content on a semesterly basis (twice a year).

# Mailing through the U.S. Post Office

If you choose to send mailers, you must list the room number or mailbox number in the address. We do not supply this information. All generically addressed items will be ""returned to sender.""

If you have any other questions regarding how you should advertise in the residence hall, please contact **Katie Olson**, the assistant director of communications and marketing, at **612-624-0656**.

*Imagine if the church across the street or the Walgreens on the corner were allowed to put posters in the hallway, or slide inserts under our doors. What you are doing is practically the same.*

If you really are just dropping **this many** cards on accident, then I will buy you the nicest business card carrier on the planet. But more seriously that could be argued you've littered quite a bit in that case, as I've seen a fair few outside on the ground as well. 

It's also just generally annoying as a student janitor here, to pick these up off the ground.

Kicked out of my room in PCV,37,44,"To say the least I made some mistakes and now my roommates in PCV don’t want to live with me anymore; but it’s so late into the quarter.

Or what steps I would have to take to live in a diff apartment in PCV? Honestly I love it here and don’t want a room change if it weren’t for my roommates persistence.

EDIT: For everyone asking what I did. I have drank a total of 4 Saturday nights since I arrived on campus. The first night with my roommates, I had 3 drinks.
The second night I blacked out and my friends (non-roommates brought me home to PCV and put me to sleep in my bed). 
Third night I got really drunk and feel asleep on the bathroom floor. So one of my roommates picked the lock, noticed I’d ‘blacked out’ and called the RA. The RA showed up, woke me up, (I was able to be awoken & spoke with the RA, albeit slurring) and he put me to sleep. 
Fourth night had 2 drinks watching a sports game.

My Roomate comes forward 9 days after the 3rd night and says he’s suffering from PTSD from the “trauma” of seeing me asleep on the bathroom floor, and that his grades are slipping and he now has developed depression over the past week and a half because of the incident. 
All my roommates drink on the weekends and smoke weed 3-4 times a week. 
I offered to stop drinking for a month and they said nothing would be enough to reverse the trauma of having to “save my life”, and that I needed to look for a new place to live, or they would ‘go through the university housing means of my removal’
Roommates have gotten so high they cannot walk before, I don’t smoke tho.

Housing situation as a new transfer,2,17,"I just wanted to say that as a new transfer student to Cal Poly for Fall 2019, it's being extremely exhausting and daunting trying to find a place to live in for a reasonable price. I accepted my offer around 23rd of April and started looking for a place from that day on. I've contacted so many people, heard back from a few and each of them just hand it off to someone else. It's ridiculous. I'm sitting on the facebook group all day, refreshing in the hopes that I can be the first person to contact someone. 

If I decide to see the apartment through facetime, it's already gone because someone else decided to say fuck it, I'll take it without looking at it. I don't know what to say, just being extremely stressed about the fact that I either have to pay $1000 for a single or just be homeless on the streets. If someone can pitch in some advice that would be great. And I know some of you are going to say look for a place earlier but I didn't decide on Cal Poly until my UC application results came in.

Edit:

Just to add more info. I have looked at on campus but they upped the price for transfers to about $1000 per month for 9 months rent. It's not worth it. I was looking to pay around $850-900 with utilities included which seems reasonable and I've found a bunch of places that are offering that. If I can pay less, the better.",bjw9yp,CalPoly

Meal Plan Predicament,21,9,"Sorry if this is a long post, I have a TDLR at the end.

I'm trying to opt out of my Meal Plan (I'm a Freshman), but the people I've emailed about it seem adamant that I can't do that. I just want to get my thoughts out onto this sub and see if I'm crazy for thinking that it's wrong to force Freshman into meal plans.

Ok so a bit of context:

I currently have the lowest tier meal plan ($1300ish a quarter). I would consider myself quite frugal, and as of right now I still have somewhere between $950 to $1000 left for this quarter's meal plan. I thought that during November, when meal plan changes are open, I could just opt out of a meal plan for both Winter and Spring quarter as the $1300 would last about the whole year for me.

The staff that I've communicated with about canceling my meal plan don't seem to understand the predicament I'm in, or they don't care. The response I had gotten was that to opt out of meal plans I would need to have some allergy and that they base their budget for the year around the meal plans. 

Now for a bit of a rant:

It appears to me that these meal plans are a way to milk money off of incoming Freshman. Not only are the meal plans mandatory, but the three options provided range from around $1300 to $1600 a quarter. I wouldn't have a problem if there were lower tiers, like $600 or $900, but currently the plans are too close to each other to really give students options.

Pulling back a little bit:

The meal plan I have charges me $577 monthly, more than half of what housing costs. My financial aid doesn't completely cover housing costs, so I still have to pay that. I don't currently have a source of income, relying on money I got from a summer job. My parents would definitely help me in paying off these costs, but I would be in a better situation (financially) if I wasn't going to be ""robbed"" $3000 because of the meal plan.

Final remarks:

I'm probably in a very small minority, since most Freshman are probably exceeding their meal plans or falling short by $100 or less. I'm honestly lost at what to do, it's so frustrating to not be able to save money to make paying off loans easier for future me.

TLDR: I want to opt out of my (Freshman) meal plan for Winter and Spring. Staff seem adamant about keeping me on the plan. I think they're milking money off of Freshman, and that I have a legitimate financial concern and should be able to opt out of my meal plan.",dtmy94,CalPoly

Cal Poly Update 2 - Welcome SLOme!,37,8,"# Cal Poly Update 2 - Welcome SLOme!

Welcome back everybody! Below you'll find my second update on what's been happening around campus - at least the parts I am familiar with.

I'd also like to mention that The ASI Board of Directors will be holding our first meeting Wed. Oct. 2nd starting at 5 PM. We always have an open forum for the first 15 minutes; students and community members can have three minutes each to share their thoughts. Feel free to swing by, talk, or just listen in on our first session.

\---

* CPX (Cal Poly Experience)
   * CPX was the campus climate survey sent out by the university last spring
   * Results of the CPX campus survey will be unveiled Oct. 17th and 18th to the public. The unveiling events will go over what the campus learned from the data.
* ASI
   * Executive Staff
      * If you're interested in getting involved with student government, considering joining ASI Executive Staff.
      * Executive Staff works with ASI President Mark Borges and his cabinet to accomplish policy objectives and run offical events.
      * Drop by the ASI Student Government office in University Union for more info, or visit our booth at Club Showcase
* Housing
   * **It's official!** Per Campus Administrative Policy (CAP), all students will need to live on campus *both* their 1st and 2nd years!
   * **But don't panic!** Housing needs to build more facilities before this is possible, so implementation is still a few years out.
   * University Housing is also looking at building more facilities via a process called Public-Private Partnership (P3).
      * The last several buildings housing has built have been paid for using CSU System Loans and rent cost increases.
      * P3 would allow off-campus developers to front the construction cost, gaining back the monies spent over time through collected rent payments - this should save students money upfront and over time!
      * The buildings would still be managed by University Housing - including residential life and bill payments. Students who live in the buildings likely won't notice the partnership.
      * **No Plans have been made / finalized as of yet**.
* Health & Wellbeing
   * DRC
      * Due to changes in state legislation, DRC is no longer offering a stipend for note takers. However, no student requesting notes will be turned away due to this change.
   * Health and Wellbeing is making a concerted effort to improve the situation of students struggling with substance abuse
      * This is a developing issue; stay tuned for more info
      * If you/someone you know is struggling with substances right now, please visit the health center or find additional resources here: [https://hcs.calpoly.edu/content/counseling/addictionsubstance-use-agencies](https://hcs.calpoly.edu/content/counseling/addictionsubstance-use-agencies)
   * Extra food from the campus community garden is being donated to the Cal Poly Food Pantry to support students in need.
* City of San Luis Obispo
   * Safety Enhancement Zones
      * The Safety Enhancement Zones will be in effect from Sept. 13th through Sept. 23rd. See the City's website for more info: [https://www.slocity.org/home/showdocument?id=16401](https://www.slocity.org/home/showdocument?id=16401)
   * Party Registration

*Students can edit their application as many times as they need to before May 7 — it does not change the date they secured housing.

*If your student would like to add roommates to their application, they need to wait for their prospective roommate to submit their applications, before they'll be able to search for them in the application.  Roommates can be added until May 7.

Hiring SLO Students for Live-in Care Assistant Position ($15/hr),150,9,"	Hey there, my name is Alex and I'm an incoming transfer student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at SLO. I'm writing this ad because I'm a bit different from your average student. I became tetraplegic after an accident while hiking in 2012. This delayed my education a little bit and I'm a few years older than the average student but I've had more time to figure out my priorities in life. Now that my first quarter at SLO is set to begin in Fall 2019, I need to hire one or two live-in personal care assistants (PCA) to help me.


	Your tasks would be helping me do some things that I can't. These include some basic things like getting me dressed, helping me shower and homemaking where you'd do normal meal-prepping, organizing, cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry etc. There are also some para-medical tasks involved like transferring me in and out of my wheelchair/bed, organizing my medicine, range of motion, bowel program, urinary catheter care etc. All necessary training will be provided and paid for. I have a detailed step-by-step of my planned morning and evening routines available upon request.


	As I'm a full-time student, I will primarily need help in the morning and evening so the rest of your day would be completely free to do as you wish. I'm also extremely flexible and adaptable. If you have any other responsibilities, like another job, that may require you to help me earlier or later than usual then please feel free to bring it up because I am more than willing to accommodate when possible. I require assistance all seven days of the week so I'm looking to split this between two people unless one person is both willing and able to take on that responsibility. A hypothetical school-day schedule would be from 6 AM to 8 AM and from 7 PM to 10 PM. Weekends will be more flexible but have more homemaking tasks assigned. Just in case you'd like to know, I only have classes Monday through Thursday in the Fall quarter. 


	The major crux of this job is that I need you to live in with me at my apartment on campus in Cerro Vista. In exchange though there are two very nice perks I can offer. Firstly, the Disability Resource Center on campus will provide anybody helping me with priority registration for all their classes at SLO. This means you'd be first in line for all your class choices for the duration of your employment. Secondly, SLO Campus Housing gave me an entire four bedroom apartment to myself so by living in with me, you would have a lot more peace and quiet than if you were to live in another dorm. If you are already assigned another dorm room, Housing can easily change it for you and you've also already satisfied the next paragraph.


	For legal reasons, Housing has told me to state in this ad that you'd be responsible for paying your own Housing fees separately and I quote ""You may be required to participate in a background check. As a resident of University Housing, the PCA will be required to follow all University Housing policies, guidelines, including the Community Rights as outlined in the University Housing Handbook, and have an active Housing Agreement/License with University Housing.""


	If you would like a general idea of what a tetraplegic's morning routine would look like, I found a great video on YouTube titled “Quadriplegic Bowel Program and Morning Routine.""

https://youtu.be/shidad_QR6I

	I have the same disability as the person in the video so my routine is similar but mine has differences that make it much easier. I have an electric lift to transfer me in and out of my wheelchair/bed. This lift makes it take much less effort than depicted in the video. My bowel program much faster than the ~45 minutes it takes in the video and my catheter requires less maintenance. I also use a power wheelchair instead of manual wheelchair.


	Compensation is $15.00 an hour and I'll need help around five hours a day. Any money spent my behalf, like grocery shopping, will be reimbursed immediately but you must provide a receipt. You'd be responsible for logging your own hours. I'd like to interview through Skype/FaceTime and if everything works out, begin training a few days before September 14 so please be available.


	if you're interested, I welcome you to contact me at fungalexander@yahoo.com I'm very enthusiastic and open about answering any and all questions you have big or small.",cv57d8,CalPoly

RA’s/Friends of RA’s: What’s Your Opinion of the Position?,15,15,"I just got offered a spot if I want it, but I’m slightly hesitant because I don’t want to accept it only to spend all year super bogged down and busy due to the job (as I’ll be taking 16+ units all year as well). The position will likely be in continuing/transfer housing, which is much easier to RA for than freshman housing, from my understanding.

I’m primarily only looking to accept the position because I’m poor as fuck and having my housing paid for by the school will at least prevent me from having to take out more loans than I already have. So now I’m just trying to figure out if that benefit outweighs the potential loss of my personal life (and sanity) if the job is really bad.

So please share any useful input you may have, especially from the ex or current RA’s out there",c77f6x,CalPoly

UCSC Housing for a Cabrillo Student?,4,5,"This might sound weird but I go to Cabrillo and rent is hella expensive everywhere, even in Aptos and Capitola. I'm currently living on the Westside of Santa Cruz and sharing a room for $750 a month, and things aren't going too great with my roommates, so I'm looking into any other places that might be available to move to.

I'm assuming it's not possible for a community college student to stay in the dorms even if they're gonna be cross-enrolled at UCSC for one class during Winter Quarter? I'm wondering because then it might be possible to take out some student loans for housing, or to use my college fund that has restrictions on it for rent. The housing agreement for UCSC says you have to be a regularly enrolled full-time UCSC student, but that ""exceptions may be made to other students.""

Tips to avoid craigslist housing scams,133,4,"I know housing is ridiculously hard to find in Santa Cruz and yall are scrambling to every open house you find on facebook and craigslist, but there are some scammers who are feeding off your desperation. *So here some red flags to be aware of when house hunting*

&#x200B;

***If the craigslist poster says that:***

1) you can *view* the home by ""driving by it"" and view it from the ""outside"", don't bother going

2) they are not home because they are \[insert long fake ass excuse, ie. such as doing missionary work in the Philippines for 2 years, moved to Colorado with their big happy family, etc.\], move onnnnn

3) they will ""ship"" you the keys once you have completed their fake little application and sent them the first security deposit via westernunion, bitcoin, moneygram, or whatever discrete payment option, leaaaveeeeeeee

4) they can't send you the address until you send the payment, dipppp

&#x200B;

Normally when you first come in contact with scammers, they will be persistent and keep asking if you are interested \[big red flag\]. Housing demand is incredibly high, so just know that no home owner will push you to rent their place because they already got a line of applicants fighting for it.

&#x200B;

You can also check if craigslist posters are lying by simply requesting the address, looking up the address, and seeing if the house is posted by others on different platforms, such as zillow, redfin, etc. If you wanna be a good samaritan, you can even contact the agents of those housing posts and report the scammers from craigslist. They will usually take action with craigslist and get those scammers removed since it is interfering with their business somewhat.

If anyone has other tips to avoid internet housing scams please feel free to share! Good luck house hunting!!",cabw7j,ucsc

Faculty List in support of the strike.,70,34,"UPDATE: UC SANTA CRUZ FACULTY ASSOCIATION OFFICIALLY SUBMITTED A LETTER OF SUPPORT THIS MORNING 12/11/19.

It can be found here: [http://ucscfa.org/2019/12/scfa-solidarity-with-graduate-students/?fbclid=IwAR0lyQhiaJW\_ZOzjHfh9Gr1YFcU10Sria\_fu0VMOSWWuRrmHFMT3eAV5LqU](http://ucscfa.org/2019/12/scfa-solidarity-with-graduate-students/?fbclid=IwAR0lyQhiaJW_ZOzjHfh9Gr1YFcU10Sria_fu0VMOSWWuRrmHFMT3eAV5LqU)

UPDATED NUMBERS. Number is now **421** as of 9:28 AM, 12/12/19. **Majority of faculty will be reached once it hits 435**.

Link to official faculty list doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GYoJ\_cxm-5ycLmEOaPxmAYgft57-wbsgL\_\_GiJQvClA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GYoJ_cxm-5ycLmEOaPxmAYgft57-wbsgL__GiJQvClA/edit)

Below is a list as of 12/9/19 of faculty that have signed on to support the grad student COLA strike, it is currently at 324 faculty. Support the strike if you can--it will not impact undergraduate grades negatively--your transcript simply won't be updated w/ fall quarter grades until an agreement is reached. Exceptions will gladly be made for students who need fall grades for grad school applications, study abroad apps, scholarships., etc. All finals will proceed and be fully graded as normal, the grades simply won't be released if there is no agreement met this week. Striking during finals week isn't easy for your TAs either--most grad students have final research papers and projects due this week as well--but the grading strike is the only way grad student labor will likely be taken seriously by the administration. The GSA responded to a fairly threatening email from admin tonight and expressed their  willingness to meet with admin as soon as possible to find a solution, so please support the grad student population--many of your professors likely already do.

To: Chancellor Larive, iCP/EVC Kletzer

We, the undersigned faculty, recognize that UCSC’s graduate students are a vital part of the campus’s ability to teach, learn, conduct research, and serve the public. The faculty would not be able to carry out our jobs without them. But their monthly wages—like the wages of the staff—are not adequate to live in Santa Cruz; they are severely “rent-burdened,” which leads to a cascade of other issues such as housing and food insecurity. The situation is untenable. We ask the administration to address the high cost of living in Santa Cruz for graduate students, allowing them to pursue their studies and to carry out their jobs.

Straight up not having a good time rn,77,28,"People protest a lot of things at this school and what I don't see being protested enough is that for my major (CS) and other majors even seniors struggle enrolling in the classes they need to graduate. Being a sophomore It's impossible to get into a ton of upper divs and I know i'm not the only one super pissed off about this. Right now i'm sitting on a waitlist of over 200 people. We shouldn't be paying insane amounts of money to have to pray every quarter to get into a class, and planning ahead seems to be impossible bc every quarter is a gamble. I know seniors that have had to stay extra quarters not because they were behind, but simply because they couldn't enroll into major requirements. Its fucked up.

Anyways sorry for the rant, I hope we can organize a protest or at least something of that nature to push for this shit to be fixed. If anyone else is super upset or even thinks i'm wrong about this too feel free to comment and let me know your opinions

I am not being picky. I’ll take a single, double, living room, loft, hell even a big enough closet. As long as it’s $800 or less.  
  
I live 2.5 hours away, so commuting daily would be near impossible.

I was previously searching for housing for me and 3 other members of my program, but they all individually found their own housing, so I’m alone.  
  
My next plan of action is to just try to get into subleases, and move every ~3 months to other subleases (since most are for a specific quarter)... But that could mean I’m left without a place on short notice.

I'm a reporter for City on a Hill Press, the student-run newspaper at UCSC.  I'm writing a story about on-campus housing and the  effects it can have on students.

If anyone wants to be interviewed and talk about how this kind of stuff has affected them, please PM me and we can set something up. I basically just want to raise awareness of the negative impacts that on-campus housing can have as well as people's possible solutions for these problems. Thanks!",bp5jih,ucsc

a (hopefully) helpful mega guide for depressi spaghetti banana slugs,56,6,"Hello my slooty slugs!

I've been seeing a lot of especially bad struggling going on this quarter, so I'm writing this post in hopes that it can help someone. I know how scary it is to seek help, especially when you don't know what to expect, so here I'm going to write everything I've learned about the CAPS and DRC process in the two and a half years I've worked with them.

**Notes:** This is the information I can give as a UC Ship student, I don't know the details for non UC Ship students, but if you walk in they will 100% tell you what they can do for you. If the thing you're struggling with is ADHD, CAPS is very limited in the help they can provide. I believe they require a full examination to diagnose an attention disorder, and even then they don't have ADHD medicine readily available in the campus pharmacy. I'm not entirely sure, though.

*The CAPS center is across the street of 9/10, upstairs and the OPPOSITE side of where the stairs lead you (right above the pharmacy). The DRC building is located in the Hahn Student Services building, which is across a bridge from the McHenry library.* 

&#x200B;

**CAPS Therapy:**

You can choose to either schedule an appointment over the phone or walk in and fill in a form for them to process you into an appointment. If you feel you're in need of immediate care, you should walk in and express this. You can be connected to a crisis therapist, who will make sure you're okay and not in danger of hurting yourself. 

When you walk in, you can take two different routes as you fill out the check in form. If you check off that you have been feeling suicidal, they will find a therapist for you immediately to make sure you're going to be okay and safe. I will strongly advise that **IF** you want to check off feeling suicidal that you check off that you do NOT have a plan on suicide if you don't want to risk getting a 5150\*\* form filed on you. It might take up to 15 minutes tops for them to find you an available therapist, depending on how busy they are. You'll almost be guaranteed a same day check in though. If you do not check off either of the two suicide boxes, they will feel you aren't in any immediate danger or in danger of hurting others and will probably schedule you for a different day appointment.

When you talk to the therapist, you just have to make sure they understand that you are not a danger to yourself. If you mention you feel depressed and unmotivated, that's enough for them to give you the help you deserve. You don't have to mention you are suicidal. If you mention you have vague suicidal ideation but that you would never follow through, it's very unlikely that they will involuntarily hospitalize you. If they think you need it, they'll give you a short term therapist to help you through the next one to threeish months probably. However they do not offer on campus long term therapy. If you want a long term therapist, they will give you a referral and you'll meet with a therapist off campus. I hear that there is a place near the Metro Center, so it'll just be a short bus ride and a small walk.

\*\***What is a 5150?** A 5150 form gets filled out by a doctor if they feel you are a danger to your own safety. It's what leads to involuntary hospitalization. Generally you don't want it to get to this. It takes away some of your legal rights for up to (but not always) three days, and you are put under the care of a hospital that will monitor your condition. If it comes to this, you'll be okay, and you'll be safe. Just stay calm, and remember that the people handling you want the best for you. They're on your side. I've been to the local psychiatric hospital, and the staff are so very supportive and sweet. Trust them, because they're there for the sole purpose of helping you. 

&#x200B;

**CAPS Medication/Psychiatric Services:**

If you express you want medication, they will assign you to a long term psychiatrist. You'll talk about your needs and they'll start you off with a SMALL dose of a medication, where you can pick up downstairs at the pharmacy. They might tell you to get your blood drawn sometime soon downstairs to make sure you're good to take medication. They'll continue meeting with you every one to two weeks so they can monitor your side effects, health, and needs. Most likely you'll jump from prescription to prescription until you find one that suits you. They might raise or decrease the dosage. They might put you on more than one to find the perfect dose for you. **Keep in mind that all of these changes are 100% YOUR CHOICE**. They will NEVER force you or pressure you to take medication. They're only there to advise you on what they think is best. You will be in control. 

The process might be a struggle, but try not to lose hope. Medication isn't for everyone, but even when it is it takes a while to get it right. Try your best to be completely honest. Feeling 10% better? Don't tell them you're good, admit that things are better but that you aren't completely happy, and they'll talk with you about if they think you should keep trying to find a better dose. It's also normal for medications to lose effectiveness after a while. Don't be discouraged. It's all part of the process. After over two years of medications, I kept making little improvements, but I only found what I think is the perfect prescription 5ish months ago. It was a long journey getting to this point, but I'm the happiest I've been in actual years. If you're feeling good about your prescription, they'll change the appointments to every month, and if you feel great and ask them, they might make it every other month etc. If you ever develop side effects and your appointment isn't until next week or month or something, they'll always be available through the Health e-Messenger.

&#x200B;

**Vacation Coverage:**

Your UC ship coverage lasts through the summer even if you aren't taking summer classes, so you don't have to worry about getting cut off for summer. They'll give you referrals to meet with people in your area over the summer, and give you the medication you need. If you can't find one close to you, they'll even go as far as to pull it up and help you find someone you can meet with. You'll also be able to access them through the e-Messenger.

&#x200B;

**DRC Accommodations:**

You know those little blurbs at the bottom of every syllabus talking about disability resources? It's not exclusive to physical or severe mental disabilities. It applies to anything academically debilitating, including depression and anxiety. You can make an appointment and they'll go over what accommodations they offer. If you have a note from a therapist it'll be much easier to get approved, but I think they also give accommodations without it. I'm not entirely sure. If you get approved, a new menu option on your student portal will be added for Disability Services where you can check off boxes for the classes you need letters for. Go ham and check them all off, whether you think you'll need them or not. It's a safety net. The Accommodation Letters will be emailed to your ucsc email after a few days. 

Being a DRC student is a godsend. Seriously. They offer things like absence and tardiness excuses, deadline extensions, and laptop approval during lectures. The effectiveness of these letters is up to the professor, so don't abuse them. Still, they'll usually be VERY understanding and will work with you a lot more leniently to help you pass. 

&#x200B;

**Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus:**

I'm hesitant to cover this, because I don't want people to glamorize the idea of having a pet on campus. It's not some fun cutesy college experience aesthetic bullshit- do NOT try and get an ESA unless you truly believe it will help you get you through your depression. Pets are not accessories, they are not feel-good tools either. They have needs, and if you're having trouble taking care of yourself, you need to think long and hard about whether you're prepared for the commitment of taking care of a whole other living being. 

**Questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether you should apply for an ESA:** Are you capable financially and physically of caring for this animal? You should have a solid few hundred dollars saved away AFTER buying all the basic care materials, in case of a veterinary emergency. You have to be capable of remembering to feed and groom and pick up after your animal every single day. Will you be available emotionally for your animal as they are for you? An ESA does not solely exist to comfort you. They are living being creatures too, and need love and affection and constant care. If you'll be gone all day sometimes and you live alone, consider the emotional well being of the animal, who will feel abandoned and alone. Will you be able to take care of this animal for potentially the next 10 years? This isn't a fish, they'll be alive for a while, and they'll bond with you. Have a solid plan for how you'll have your ESA with you after graduation.

**Still want an ESA?** The ESA application can be picked up at the DRC. If you have a note from a therapist, it'll be much easier to get approved. The approval process will take a few weeks, and then you'll schedule a meeting with your housing coordinator to go over the rules. When you get your ESA, you'll meet with them again to give them your pet's health records.

**Getting an ESA:** You can bring a pet you already own at home, or adopt one if you feel ready for the commitment. If you're struggling a lot with the common symptoms of depression (fatigue, lack of self care, inability to go outside) and you really want an ESA, please get a cat. A dog needs a lot of extra care, and for you to give them the best quality of life, you'll need to be able to walk them every single day for a good amount of time. For where to get the animal, the first main options I considered were Craigslist and the Santa Cruz Shelter. However, Craigslist results will mostly be in neighboring cities, so be ready for a drive to meet and pick them up. For the local shelter, you need to be over 21 to adopt. Soooo I personally had to fall back on Petsmart's in store shelter, where I met my best buddy Bailey. Also be aware when adopting, that you are responsible for any damage or disturbance your pet causes. A loud or destructive animal is definitely not a good candidate.

Be aware that there is usually a 100-150$ adoption fee, on top of needing to buy a brush, scratching post/litterbox for cats, toys for dogs, and pet food and potentially litter regularly. Be prepared to spend 200$ straight away. Then also be ready to pay the monthly fees for care. I personally have to spend \~40$ every month for litter and cat food. 

*When you adopt this animal, you are adopting a new friend and family member, so don't fuck around and be a good owner for your good boye/gorle.*

**ESA Housing Rights:** An ESA is actually protected by California law in terms of housing. Any apartment, including ones that have a no pet policy, cannot turn you away or charge you more for having an ESA. If you provide proper documentation, they must allow you to keep your animal with you as long as they do not damage the property or cause a disturbance of any kind. However, this is in terms of housing only. ESA's are *not* Service Animals. Service Animals are trained and are allowed basically anywhere, but your ESA is basically just another pet in every other aspect. Hopefully though, this housing protection will help you stay with your animal after graduation.

*If you abandon your ESA after the school year ends, I will send PG&E after you.*

**Don't be afraid to get the help you need!**

If you're depressed or struggling, you deserve to get the help you need. Don't ever feel like what you're going through isn't real or important enough to be addressed. It might help and it might not, but don't ever forget that there is help and support available for you. DMs are always open.",dzyhjf,ucsc

Did you see my Dad (70m) fall in front of the Hugh Greer Field House last night (12/4) at ~6pm?,104,28,"Hi UCONN! My Dad works every M/W Huskies game, and on his walk in from his car last night he (presumably) slipped on ice, fell, and hit his head.

I am trying to figure that out as knowing that may improve the medical care he can be provided.

The police officer who called it in told us a student ran up to him to report a man laying on the sidewalk. He doesn't know who that student is.

First of all, a big generous thank you to that student! You may have saved a life. If you see something, say something, folks.

If you are that student, or you are someone else that saw what happened, please send me a message. We are interested in any information you might have as we try to piece this together.

I’m taking a couple classes this summer at Storrs and I need housing. I applied for summer housing in March when the application opened. Everything has been approved and I’m scheduled to move in tomorrow. 

I don’t think the amount of money financial aid gave me for the summer is enough because my housing is really expensive (I’m living on campus for basically the whole summer.) I called them to ask for more money but they said to wait until I get my official bill from ResLife. I called ResLife and they said they’re not sure when I’ll be billed...

Questions regarding Social Life at UCONN,7,7,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 21 year old Dutch student from Amsterdam who's excited to go on exchange to UCONN in the 2020 spring semester. Looking at some of the posts here, I find lots of contradicting statements regarding life at UCONN. Being born and raised in Amsterdam, I don't have any experience with living on campus in a remote area. I was wondering if you could help me answer some of the following questions.

\- Can exchange students join student clubs? If so are there any you guys recommend?

\- I have heard all about greek life and it seems kind of similar to the student club life here in Amsterdam. Is it possible to join a fraternity if you are only there one semester or is it possible to join their activities some other way? Do you guys recommend any particular fraternities? 

\- Is it easy to obtain tickets to your athletic team's games (Basketball, Ice Hockey, Football etc.)? When is the best time to buy them?

\- I found that there were multiple dorms on Uconn. Which dorms/houses are the best/most fun and why? Also do you recommend sleeping with a roommate or on your own? Just wondering what your experiences are.

Thank you!

P.S. If you have any questions about an exchange to Amsterdam or some general questions, just let me know and I will be glad to answer them ;)",dfhqqf,UCONN

I need help,54,77,"I’m a second year student. During the summer before my freshman year I was diagnosed with salmonella poisoning. All throughout my freshman year I had major health problems that culminated in me being diagnosed with a heart condition and post infectious IBS from the salmonella. This basically means that I need to go to the bathroom multiple times a day often for long periods of time. There is someone in my dorm who has been doing inappropriate sexual things in the bathroom stalls. Because I spend so long in the bathroom I was an immediate suspect. I know that doing inappropriate sexual things in the bathroom is wrong and would never ever consider doing them. I have had meetings with my RA and hall director explaining them my illness and they said they heard someone making skin slapping and moaning noises and I vehemently denied that it was me because that sort of thing is totally inappropriate to do in the bathroom. However yesterday while I was using the bathroom, someone yelled from the sink area and told me to stop doing inappropriate things in the stall when all I was doing was using the bathroom. I do not know what they heard that could lead them to believe that. All I can think is that I wiped my rear end but I’m really scared because they reported it to the RA and hall director and now I have another meeting and I’m scared that I’m going to possibly lose my housing and status as a UConn student.

Would you be willing to live in a boarding house?,14,13,"LSU used to have quite a few boarding houses near campus. Mostly used by grad students and single professors. You got a room to yourself, usually shared a bathroom with one or two people of the same gender, and had all meals prepared for you by the ""landlady"". Some had rules about curfews, guests in the rooms, etc., but this was during the old days.

Would you be interested in living in a modern boarding house? All meals prepared for you, shared bathroom, study room, common room (living room), no curfew (but rules about loud/drunken antics), overnite guest allowed, laundry service (optional), bedding provided and changed weekly, cleaning and maintenance included.

We've been discussing this as an alternative to on campus housing and wondered what the interest would be.",cfydfg,LSU

What makes campus drivers so impatient? Don't you hate how it makes you feel?,46,5,"So today I'm sitting at the intersection of S. Campus and Highland on my bike waiting for the light. Two cars in front of me, a silver Nissan Versa and behind it a mid-2000s Jeep Wrangler. Lady in the Jeep is fully losing her shit because the Nissan in front of her won't turn right and block the crosswalk so she can keep going. Honking, yelling, beating on her steering wheel, revving the engine so hard I had to back up to avoid being gassed, all that. I've never seen someone so angry in a car in my life.

Similarly, I've had cars pull into opposing traffic to pass me on Dalrymple between Tower and Field House and all along S. Stadium. I get it - bikes are slower than cars as a general rule. When I ride on River Road it's safe and legal to cross the line to pass me, and I always encourage you to do so because I don't like being in front of you any more than you like being behind me. But on campus when I'm hopping between classes using the road I'm doing 22-25mph because it feels great and I don't have to hold that speed for more than a few minutes. If you're going fast enough to pass me in the opposing lane on campus you're going to kill someone to save no time at all.

Why would anyone drive on campus at all if they get that mad at being held up for a bit? It's a campus, you're going to stop at ten crosswalks and emergency brake for at least two dopes stepping off the sidewalk on their phones on your way across it anyway. If it's that bad go park near the outskirts of campus and walk to where you need to be. It's lovely this time of year and it'll give you the time you apparently so desperately need to relax.",dq0uuf,LSU

Few questions about off campus apartments from a confused incoming junior,5,5,"LSU usually pays for my housing through financial aid so I’ve been living on on campus apartments , I was wondering is there a way for me to use that money to make a down payment ( or whatever it’s called ) for an off campus apartment ? I’m a complete noob when it comes to this and I just assume everyone who lives off campus has it very well off because I was looking at prices and Southgate says like 990-1000 something for a studio ?? Is that every month ? I’m sorry if I sound so ignorant but personally would like to live “off campus” maybe my senior year . I’m trying to be frugal of course so recommendations are welcomed , if there’s any places that allows pets that would be cool as well . I would want to get an apartment that’s walking distance to campus because I’m still working on getting myself a car ! PMS are welcomed and again I’m sorry if I sound so ignorant , I just wanted to know if I’m wasting money staying on campus bc I decided not to get a meal plan last school year and they refunded me the money and it lasted me very long and I even was able to use it to help with other expenses",cbbfqj,LSU
How bad are the Edward Gay Apartments?,2,34,"So I applied to LSU last minute (I didn't think I would get in, it took forever to convince myself to apply). I am now admitted and paid the enrollment fee, however, this means now I am late with applying for the apartments. Originally, I was just going to stay with my cousin, but now I figured out that she has 6 people already living there and adding a 7th we would struggle with food (they eat everything!). So now I am trying to get on the wait list for the East Campus Apartments and the West Campus Apartments. I spoke to the people in housing and they say the on campus apartments are 60% full and to name my top 3 choices, I listed the WCA, ECA (both are furnished), and the Edward Gay Apartments (unfurnished), and as a last resort I'd be willing to live in the dorms (not looking at them because beggars can't be choosy). They told me my best bet would be the Ed gay apartments because the application for that apartment opens on June 3rd. But I just read an article that says the Ed gay apartments need to be tore down because it's old, you have to keep your air condition on 70  because if you lower it in the summer mold will grow on the walls. I also heard that the apartments have small roaches (which are hard to get rid of). IDK what to do, if I stay with my cousin, I might have to fight for food and have no privacy. I can't afford off campus apartments because I have no Job but I have money, but they said I would need a co-sign ( which i have no one to co sign), I am not from baton rouge so I can scratch out a roommate (unless it's a random from the internet).  Are the Ed Gay Apartments that bad? Also, should I stay on the wait list and still fill out the Ed Gay Apartments as a last resort?

Why did you choose to go to LSU?,4,22,"I'm debating on going to LSU, Nicholls State University, and Louisiana Tech. I am a 24 yr old transfer student coming from a community college (I just graduated with my associates in Business) and I will be majoring in business information systems. I know LSU is huge, it's defiantly bigger than a community college, it's probably bigger than Nicholls and La Tech combined. How do you get over or deal with being in big classes? Do you think LSU is worth the money you're spending? Did LSU help you find a job or get internships easier? Did you find that your classes was harder just because you're at a big name college? I am asking this because I want to make an informed decision when I pick my college. Some of my friends are saying it would be better for me going to LSU, because I can live with my cousin and commute to school. They said that I'd probably end up paying the same thing if I go to Nicholls or La tech because I have to pay for housing. My friends think LSU would be better for me to network because networking is important in the tech field and it is a better investment as far as my career goes. They said with my job it will be worth it because I will get a great job to be able to pay the student loans that I will have to take out back. They also said I could probably get a job or connects just from being or maybe meeting other LSU Alumi. My friends sound convincing because Nicholls does not have a huge Alumi network like LSU, and LA Tech network is bigger than Nicholls but not as great as LSU. If it helps I did look at the numbers and they do seem right about the housing stuff. Any advice, stories, thoughts, etc. can help me.

My roommate is fine, but she's a total homebody (she has a car but she never wants to go anywhere with me and I don't want to walk around alone in the evenings) and I hate staying in doing nothing. I need something to do but I have no car (it's back in Washington) and everything costs money I don't have (if I can't use paw points, I can't pay for it).

I considered rushing, but the drinking/party culture really isn't my style and I don't have enough money for dues or the outfits and events they seem to constantly be out doing. I have joined a few clubs, but they often conflict with one another, so I'm down from the original ones I was a part of to only a handful. Plus, the friends I've made in my studio class and clubs are mostly commuters, so outside of class no one's really around. My main club has tried getting together multiple times at one girl's house, but for whatever reason we can't manage to get our shit together enough to have even one casual get together happen even if we plan it like two weeks in advance. The campus ministries have been absolutely lovely to me, but I still always feel a bit off, like I just can't truly let loose and be happy. Honestly, the strongest emotion I get from being here is boredom :(  . I went to a football game, but it really (no offense to the players, they work hard and I appreciate them) sucked entertainment wise, they spend more time off the field than on and honestly the golden girls are way more fun to see. 

I just feel like there's nothing to do around here and I can't get close enough to anyone to feel like I'm really making friends. I feel like I just can't truly connect with girls (I was pretty much only close with guys in high school and I haven't met any girl that I can truly be myself around. I end up acting wayyy to formal and reserved. As for guys, I've literally only felt like I'm getting hit on if I talk with them more than a few times.) Honestly the lack of proper and comfortable socialization has made me so depressed I can't get by a single day on less than 11 hours of sleep and it absolutely drains me. On top of that I don't know where anything is off campus and I have literally no personal money at all. I started the semester off fine, but at this point, it just sucks.",a05fd2,LSU
Bisexuality in Sororities?,16,8,"I'll be a freshman in Fall 2019, and I'm planning on rushing, but I'm afraid that the girls will ostracize me if once/hopefully in a house, they find out I'm bisexual.

How many students at LSU actually pay out of pocket?,3,30,"Hi, I'm interested in transferring to LSU for the Spring semester and I've noticed a majority of people I know who attend this university are on scholarships where they only have to pay for housing.

I just have this stigma in my mind that there is next to none students who actually have to balance a job during the school year to afford attending LSU.

I am 22 years old, I've already graduated with an associate's degree from Ivy Tech, but then I transferred from Ivy Tech to IUPUC, and then to IUB. I can't stand the obnoxious freshman, and the dorms are very disgusting making my anxiety peak to all time highs.

I'm a middle-aged male with a three-year-old boy... and without a car. I'm hoping people could offer some pointers for finding housing that isn't prohibitively horrible/inconvenient/expensive.

Potential issues:

* I have a bike seat for the kid, but obviously need a place that's a walkable distance either from campus or from a dependable bus route (i.e. one that doesn't stop running at 6pm, on weekends, or when school is out).

* I have my own furniture and hundreds of books. In some ways this is awesome, but it could create a problem when it comes to moving into a small apartment or a shared/communal residence or the like.

* I'm a little picky about some things, but I have a tight budget. Electric bills that shoot up to $200 in the winter are a turn-off, as are places that allow smoking... or anything else that I'd want to protect my son from. I don't want to settle for something crappy, but I also can't afford to spend a thousand or more each month on rent alone.

I've done some searching and so far the most likely-looking option is Park Doral. But any insight, feedback, or advice people could offer would be awesome. Thanks!",6di68o,IndianaUniversity
Incoming Freshman (Class of 2023),20,35,Well to begin I'm more than a little lost. I'm definitely hyped for college but it's still stressful not knowing exactly what I'm getting into. What did you guys do to prepare for this transition from high school to college? How should I prepare myself? what should I do and research? I'm checking out housing now and meal plans (which I still dont really get tbh) and from there I'm not sure what to do next. I dont really know any people going but I think once I'm actually on campus I'll be more than fine. If anyone could share their stories and the knowledge they've gained that would be awesome. I'd like to hear from you guys about your experiences and learn from what worked for you. Maybe then I'll be able to figure it out for myself. I'm going in as a pre CS Major though I talked to my advisor and she said I'll be receiving another letter soon maybe next week (EDIT: Just received the email and I was in fact direct admitted to SICE) saying I'm direct admitted into CS and will be able to start as a sophomore due to having enough DC/AP credit transfers.

On the other hand, I couldn't find any review on Lincoln Hill Apartments. Does anyone know about this place or its owner, Grant Property?

We selected central as our preferred neighborhood, which I believe narrows our housing down to just Eigenmann, as we did not elect to be part of a living-learning community. Do we have a good chance of getting this room together based on when we filled the application out and the amount of triples available? If not, would IU match two of us together and have the third go random or would we all go random? Also, we are all enrolled if that influences this at all. Thanks!",2vtfsa,IndianaUniversity

I already added my name to the housing contract release waitlist (they'll release me if there's enough spring admits that need a spot), but the only way to guarantee I get out of my contract is if I find someone who has not applied for housing yet for Spring 2020.

USC is lame and has provisions to this, though:
1. We both have to go to the housing office at the same time to do this process
2. You can't move in until two weeks after the semester starts (this part is terrible imo)

Some Housing Tips/Recs from a Freshman!,43,10,"Hi all! To all the new freshman admits, congrats and welcome! USC is THE place to be. I'm finishing up my 2nd semester here at USC and thought it'd be nice to give a little bit of breakdown of the different housing options that you have for your first semester in college. I remember being so confused about different dorm names and wanting to know more about the different cultures of each dorm. 

Here are my personal top three dorm recommendations:

**Birnkrant** - If you're looking for a social dorm experience, BK is where it's at. Not only is it socially-active, it's also generally cleaner than other social dorms like New North. BK is also located in the center of campus, so going to class won't be a trek. The campus Starbucks is right under, and Leavey library is literally steps away from the entrance. Birnkrant is a good middle ground between Mccarthy and New North.


**Parkside A&H** - I'm honestly so happy I chose to live in 'Parkside Darkside'. Even though it has a rep for being socially dead and quiet (to a certain extent, true), if you're the type of person who wants to come home to a quiet and clean building after class, Parkside is the way to go. The suites are SUPER nice and spacious, we have cleaners who clean your private bathrooms, and the best campus dining hall is right here too! One of the main things that turns people off about PRB is the distance from classes. PRB is great if you're in Viterbi or Roski, but for someone who has all of their classes in Marshall (me), walking 15 minutes everyday can be a bother.


**Pardee** - Pardee tower is another solid choice. It's also located conveniently near most classes and in the middle of campus. Pardee is pretty social, you'll be able to find cool people on your floor for sure. There's also a business community floor in Pardee, which is something cool to look into if you're in Marshall. Pardee has spacious study rooms, but the rooms are pretty much the same size / vibe as the other residential buildings.


TIPS / REMINDERS:

McCarthy is only for Presidential and above scholarship students. If you put mccarthy as your housing options and you're not a scholarship recipient, you will be reassigned to a random building. One of my suitemates made this mistake, so don't put it down as your first three preferences!


Find a compatible roommate. You don't want to be stuck living with a randomly assigned roommate you don't end liking. Go join the USC 2023 facebook group, post a profile, and find someone you vibe with. Use online resources / apps like RentHoop - it's like a Tinder for roommates - to be more upfront about your 'dealbreakers' in housemates. 


GET DINING DOLLARS. the dining hall food will get old FAST! Dining dollars will save your hungry self when you're not in the mood for more overcooked EVK chicken. There are so many other food options on campus - Lemonade, Panda Express, Habit Burger - and dining dollars will most definitely help you out later in the year.


Again, congrats on your acceptances and good luck!",bmqby8,USC

usc housing for returning undergrad,8,6,"hello fellow trojans,

&#x200B;

i was just wondering what the chances were of a returning undergraduate getting usc housing? only reason i ask was cause i didn't get a spot last year for this year but i wasn't sure if it was because i'm too old or something. i did apply kinda late (april or something) so is it still possible to get a spot if I apply now?

Incoming Freshman–Which Housing Should I Choose?,0,5,"Hey guys, I'm going to be an incoming freshman for the upcoming academic year at USC and I heard it's better to apply as soon as possible so I'm trying to choose which housing I would like to stay in next year. 

I want housing that is clean, newer and nicely furbished. As for social scene, I don't go out every single night but I would like a housing choice that gives me the opportunity to meet lots of new friends and socialize. My number one choice right  now is Parkside arts and humanities and I heard that it's got nice, clean suites as well as a really good dining hall nearby. Based on your understanding, is Parkside a good dorm for meeting new friends/people? I'm not the type to party every night but especially as a freshman, I still want to meet lots of people and have an active social life.

Any advice would be helpful thanks!",bae992,USC

I am incoming graduate student at USC for the spring term, and I am looking for a 1 bedroom apartment/studio, with A/C.  Finding housing so far has been impossible. I'm checking FB daily, as well as craigslist and the major websites :( , so if you guys have anything I'd be willing to consider.

Requirements:

1) A/C

2) At/Near walking distance to campus

3) Single bedroom with no roommates preferred OR a private room and bathroom if it will be a shared apartment

Edit 3: Some great suggestions. Still looking for housing, with the following amendments on the requirements:

1) A/C preferred, but not mandatory.

2) Near campus preferred, or next to a metro stop, at most a 20 minute commute time by public transport.

3) Single/ private room with private bath preferred.

From: Cynthia Barnhart <chancellor-reply@mit.edu>
Subject: Sharing the decision on Senior House
Date: June 12, 2017 at 3:05:32 PM EDT
To: <@mit.edu>

Dear ...,
 
I write on behalf of MIT's senior leadership to inform you of our decision and our plans to support you.
 
The turnaround we launched last June engaged you and a number of faculty, staff, and alumni in work to promote personal wellbeing and academic success in your community. As you know, we received credible and concerning information this past semester and launched a review. A few weeks ago, we informed you of our findings that serious and unsafe behaviors and activities occurred in the house during the turnaround. Unfortunately, these behaviors and activities have served to fundamentally undermine our shared goals for the safety, health, and academic success of all Senior House residents.
 
The senior officers and I have met with many of you to discuss this matter, and we have received and read many emails on this topic. Before making our decision, we carefully listened to and reflected on what we heard. I hope that, through this dialogue, you gained an appreciation for the position we are in given our responsibility to provide all students with safe and healthy residential communities.
 

**Decision & Support**
 
We believe that significant change is needed and have made our decision based on our concern and care for present and future residents of the house. The details of our decision are:

All residents who wish to live in Senior House during the 2017-18 academic year must complete an application to be a member of the community. You will see that we are seeking individuals who are committed to contributing to a residential environment that supports residents' academic and personal development.

Because the process will be very selective, many of you will want or need to make alternative housing arrangements for next year. Please know that we are committed to identifying supportive and welcoming options for every member of your community who wishes to live on campus. You can learn more about the relocation process and indicate your housing preferences here. (Also note that, even if you complete a Senior House application, you still need to fill out the housing preferences form so that you can secure a holding assignment while your application is reviewed).

We will work to find you room assignments in other residence halls as either individuals or as part of small groups of friends. Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson has established a relocation team led by Dean David Randall and Associate Director Jen Hapgood-White to provide guidance and support for you throughout this process. If you have questions about another residential community, moving off-campus, dining, financial aid, work study or any other topic associated with moving, they can help starting today. To reach this team, please email residential-support@mit.edu.


**Moving Forward**
 
In addition to students whose applications are approved and the New House students already scheduled to move in while their building undergoes renovations, a cohort of first-year students will reside in the house next year. We are currently developing a program for first-years focused on the personal wellbeing and academic success principles and goals of the turnaround. The program will feature strong faculty and staff engagement as well as opportunities for peer mentorship.
 
While some of you will be disappointed with our decision, I hope you will understand it is firmly rooted in our care for you as students and our concerns about the health and wellness of your residential environment. The senior officers and I are obligated to protect our students' wellbeing and to require accountability when the facts of a serious situation warrant it.
 
We have also worked to respect your privacy and to keep this matter as confidential as we can. We appreciate that you have done the same, and that you have engaged with us throughout the entirety of this process. With a decision now made, we would like to continue to keep what prompted the review and the review's findings private.
 
Please remember that Dean Randall and Associate Director Hapgood-White are ready to help you right now and can be reached at residential-support@mit.edu. Dean Nelson and I are also here for you if you want to talk about the future at any point over the summer.
 
Sincerely,

Senior Haus is going to be graduate housing this fall.,83,54,"""Dear XXX,

I wrote last month that significant change is needed in Senior House.
President Reif, Provost Schmidt, Vice President Zuber, and I made that
decision together.

The reaction from the Senior House community has reinforced our decision.
The misinformation, denials, and responses – online, in emails, and in
person – violate MIT values. We no longer believe that first-year and
continuing students living in Senior House next year will be able to define
for themselves their own community values and living experience.

This has led us to conclude that our plan to re-set the undergraduate
experience in Senior House is unworkable. Senior House is now closed to
undergraduates, and it will reopen in the fall to graduate students. We
continue to stand by our responsibility for providing all MIT students with
safe residential environments, and we intend to fulfill that obligation.

You recently received your alternate fall housing assignment. If you have
any questions or concerns about dining, financial aid, work study or any
other topic associated with moving, please do not hesitate to contact David
Randall or Jennifer Hapgood-White at residential-support@mit.edu.

Sincerely,

Prefrosh Housing Questions,2,16,"The 2018 i3 guides just came out for housing and I just had a questions about rooming. I'd love to get a single at MIT as a freshman but I know thats unlikely not choosing MacGregor. I saw that Maseeh 21&#37;, Simmons 62&#37;, Baker had 66&#37; singles, Burton Conner 77&#37;. Would you guess that that's also the order in likelihood of getting a single at each dorm? Reason I'm asking is that I read somewhere that you're likely to get a single at Simmons as a freshman but not at Burton Conner.

In the same vein, if I got into one of the latter 3 dorms, is it likely I would be placed in a triple or quad if I didn't want one or is the most likely scenario that I'm able to get at least a double if I requested a single.

Sorry I know these questions might be a little hard to answer, but thanks! I appreciate any information about one specific dorm or comparisons between some.",8i0bpr,MIT

Deputy EVP to Retire,19,0,"Dear MIT faculty and staff,

I write to share the news that following much reflection in recent months, Tony Sharon has let me know of his decision to retire as deputy executive vice president at the end of the current calendar year, following 20 years of exceptional service to the Institute.

I first met Tony in 2004, when we both participated in MIT’s Leader to Leader program. I was immediately impressed by him, and my admiration has only grown since then. Tony’s unwavering dedication and deep appreciation of MIT's mission have been invaluable over the past six years of our close work together.

Tony’s extensive experience, along with his distinctive and approachable interpersonal style, made him an obvious choice to become MIT’s first deputy executive vice president. Since accepting the role in 2013, Tony has been one of my closest and most trusted advisors. He has created bridges and strengthened relationships across MIT, while partnering with me to lead our senior management team and oversee the operations of MIT’s administrative areas.

After 25 years of service in the United States Air Force, Tony began his MIT career at Lincoln Laboratory in 1999 as the assistant leader of the Advanced Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Engineering and Operations Group. He was appointed as Lincoln Laboratory’s assistant director for operations in 2006, responsible for the Laboratory’s operations, annual operating and capital investment budget, and government research contract.

Under Tony’s leadership as MIT’s deputy executive vice president, the campus has experienced an unprecedented period of capital renewal, through both comprehensive upgrades to aging facilities as well as new construction. With his guidance, deferred maintenance has steadily declined since 2015. Tony’s commitment to improving student housing has been critical as we have advanced renovations to dormitories and new construction for both undergraduate and graduate students. His significant contributions to the Institute will have visible and lasting impact well into the future.

Tony has also been pivotal in attracting talent to a number of important leadership positions across the administrative areas, and he has played a key role in building and mentoring the next generation of administrative leaders for the Institute. Over the coming months, with the benefit of the very strong team that Tony has put in place, we will work to distribute his portfolio of responsibilities across the organization.

We will have occasion to celebrate Tony and his contributions later this fall, but for now, I hope you will join me in expressing our gratitude to him for his tremendous service to MIT.

Sincerely,

Israel Ruiz",d2faa9,MIT

Graduate housing query,6,6,"I am an incoming grad student at MIT

So here's the situation. I _really_ want to live with a friend of mine(also an incoming student) primarily due to similar dietary restrictions. Bot of us filled Ashdown 3BR and Ashdown 2BR as our priorities during the first round.

I was not alloted any housing while he was alloted Ashdown 2BR.

I now have a chance to enter the secondary housing allocation. And later, round 2 will open for both of us. I've no idea what the difference between the two is and what the rules are related to them. I couldn't find an relevant information online.

What would the optimal policy be to ensure us getting housing together? Can both of us enter as a group for sidpac in the next round or does he have to enter ashdown for round 2?",8h3iic,MIT
Late payment of graduate housing,4,4,"Hi Everyone,

I'm an incoming MechE masters student this fall and I've been starting to wonder how to handle some of the payments for graduate housing.

Current student with sudden change in financial situation -- what to do about COA,28,5,"Hi, guys. I just got off the phone with my parents, and it seems like I'm going to be on my own financially starting today. They've been covering almost all of my primary costs, including tuition, housing, and a portion of my food. I haven't been receiving financial aid this whole time since they have had a good past few years in terms of their business, but now it looks like they won't have an income this year due to their business being highly dependent on a demand that just isn't there right now. They are both technically retired and are too old to work, but they have kept a small business going to put me through school. Now their remaining savings isn't enough to pay for another semester here, or even my younger sibling's first year of college, since they need money to survive and pay off their mortgages.

My parents promised to pay for my tuition, which was the greatest gift I could have ever hoped for after learning that I could go to school here, but now that it's suddenly gone, I feel so unprepared and scared. My student jobs aren't nearly enough to cover all of my costs, and it's my fault that my sibling will have to start paying for college at 18 when I had help.

What should I do?

Didn't get a slot in the lottery. Does /r/mit have any good recommendation to alternative housing near MIT? ,9,16,"So, there's still the 2nd round to go, but I thought it might be worthwhile checking what the alternatives might be. I'd prefer somwhere within walking distance to the campus, and prefably no worries about walls caving in, rodents or the lack of internet access. 

Also, I'd prefer something along the lines of an efficiency, and hopefully comparable in price to those of the grad dorms. (~$1300/month).

Are there any well known alternatives that are recommended?

Some Questions for some MIT Graduate Students,6,15,"Hey guys! I was accepted to a Ph.D. program at MIT with the Chemistry department, but I deferred my enrollment to start Fall 2019. As excited as I am to move from IL to MA, I wanted to be prepared for the transition as well as get some of my questions answered about what to expect when I get there while also help me in my move planning.

1. I've read that bringing my car is essentially useless in the Cambridge/Boston area unless I want an excuse to not drink, but I have a motorcycle I will be bringing with me as I will not have any way to store it and have someone reliable take care of it (i.e. ride it and run it occasionally) during my extended time away from home (plus, I don't want to part with it). Is it possible to pay for a parking permit and have it with me near my dorm in a covered lot/garage for several months? If not, is there any storage facilities nearby campus I can keep it at that you know of? 
2. As an incoming graduate student, how easy was applying and getting graduate housing? I recall reading on the webpage that you need to be fully registered, but, as a new grad student, will registration take place before the application closes for housing? Or is there an exception? Or will I be ultimately stuck rushing to get paperwork in next August when I arrive with my belongings to find housing? I am concerned because I will be funding my entire move only through money I am earning at a full-time job, and I would like gauge how much I should aim to save up.
3. I have the understanding it is nearly unheard of to live on-campus at MIT for more than a few years as a graduate student, but is it possible? Renting near campus without roommates is insane compared to my current rent in the suburbs of Chicago (which can be somewhat pricey still). For those of you who transitioned from on- to off-campus, what suggestions would you have to make it easier? Were you more involved in social events your first year and able to find roommates with friends? How did you find a place? How did you find your roommates?
4. I am looking to visit the area before the visiting weekend in March 2019 since I have never been to MA. Is there any places you would suggest I see or go to? It will likely be on a weekend, so I don't expect to see much relating to the MIT facilities.
5. What is something you like about MIT, and what is something you think could be better? Is there anything I should be mentally preparing myself for?

Thanks for helping relieve my anxiety! ",9fjms9,MIT

Memories of Senior House from former housemasters Henry and Cynthia Jenkins (multi-part),42,1,,8ghktr,MIT
Senior House: done deal? Protest?!,38,14,"PhD alum here on the West Coast, just hearing about the administration closing Senior House. I'm furious. 

Senior House (and East Campus more generally) has a long tradition of being a home for people who are different. And that's who MIT is for. MIT is for more conventional students too and that's fine. But people who are weird and smart go to MIT instead of other fine educational institutions. And Senior House embraces them with all of their complexities and flaws and Haus shares in having complexities and flaws. 

I don't know what exactly lead to the administration's decision. That's not the point of this post. 

The point is that Senior House is not just about the students who are there currently. It's about a longstanding community of people who lived, hung out there, and returned to there. Closing the dorm, to me, means rejecting a critical part of MIT's core values. And rejecting a critical part of the MIT community. 

Gah! This decision is wrong!! 

Is it a done deal? Can we fight this? Is there a fight happening? Some threads here suggest that the current residents have their hands tied.  But there's a heck of a lot of other people who could get involved.  

I wasn't an undergrad at MIT. But as an MIT person, I'm still pissed.",6h8grv,MIT

"""Remember your Home at MIT"" Alumni Donation Campaign",33,22,"In case any alumni haven't noticed, MIT is currently running a donation campaign to alumni asking them to remember their home at MIT and make a donation.

I highly encourage alumni to stop any donations to MIT. Please continue to donate to student groups you care about by donating in methods that do not count as a contribution to MIT (cash, venmo/paypal, any way that is not through the giving.mit.edu site).

Why the MIT administration is uncommunicative about Senior House,16,7,"Throughout the Senior House saga, the administration appears to have been minimizing the scope of its public statements and its participation in discussion. They've left most of the public arguments on the issue unaddressed, in a way that appears unresponsive to student and public concerns and unfair to Senior House residents.

Of particular note is the claim that Senior House has a lower graduation rate because of its demographics, particularly including racial and income demographics, and that disbanding Senior House is discriminatory. But here's the thing. As soon as that accusation was made publicly, the MIT administration could no longer speak freely; all statements from that point forward were filtered through lawyers, lawyers who carefully consider whether each statement would hurt MIT in a lawsuit. So an in-depth discussion of the graduation rate and drug use survey statistics is out. A dialogue with protesters is out, because speaking under uncontrolled circumstances would risk Cynthia Barnhart ending up like Lawrence Summers.

This was a mistake, since the non-communicative strategy burnt bridges and built ill will, but that's probably what happened.

So MIT asked everyone to reapply for residence, and got a pile of readmission applications. These applications would have been only a subset of Senior House, and not a random subset; it will have a somewhat different cultural and demographic distribution than the original set of residents. They looked at this pile of applications with two questions in mind: (1) Will this set of people create the sort of culture they want? And (2) Does this set of people have racial or other demographic differences from the original Senior House population, such that if they accept only the people who applied for readmission, they can get sued for racial discrimination?

After considering those two questions, MIT decided to disband Senior House entirely. Somewhere, they have a confidential memo describing their reasons, and a confidential memo describing the demographics of the population that applied for readmission. These documents are most likely discoverable - meaning, a court can order their disclosure - but only in the context of a lawsuit brought by someone with standing (ie, a Senior House resident).

There's the situation as I understand it. Make of it what you will, but be warned that many options for action disappear at the end of the summer.

(I am a local but not an MIT student, and have no personal stake in the Senior House issue. I am posting this because I am sympathetic to Senior House's cause, and believe that accurately understanding the situation will increase the odds of achieving a good outcome.)",6m25gx,MIT

Recommendations for housing or things to do?,10,8,"Hey guys,

I’m applying to graduate school at Houston and UT Austin and wanted to figure out a couple things.

Housing 
Anything that’s cheap and accessible to the school. I’m used to paying 1500+ dollars for housing in Jersey but I understand the pay in Texas is probably lower. Any recommendations? I know UT does not have graduate housing. Does the school allow grad students to stay in undergrad apartments?

Nightlife&Recreation
Houston is a big city so there is probably a lot to do. I used to take the train to NYC for bars, clubs, and food. The Hoboken and New Brunswick area also gave me great options in terms for food and breweries. Also, where can I go for GOOD pizza.

Last but not least....I heard that Texas has great steak. Any recommendations?

Questions about applying for housing,3,6,"My buddy and I are currently attempting to apply for housing at the University Lofts, we are juniors attending this fall. He applied a couple weeks ago whereas I applied a month or so ago. I have been accepted and he hasn't but we know for sure he will be accepted so we wanted to go forward with the housing application process ASAP. Anyways, on my AccessUH homepage, I have various university services available (MealPlan, MyHousing, MyParking, etc.) whereas he only has two (Faculty/Course Evaluation and MyUH Self Service). Everything we have been led to believe from various sources as well as on the website that prospective students may apply for housing, is this not true?

roommate suddenly moving out? NU.in student moving in next semester?,10,5,"hi,

im a second year here at NEU and my roommate just informed me that they will not be living in our shared room in our on campus apartment next semester. dunno where they are moving but whatever.

they said they think i might end up with a “single” aka no one move in because they made the housing change today? that it was “late in the process” so perhaps i wont get another roommate (fine by me!).

Why I'm Not Releasing for LightView,117,16,"I was going to make this a longer post, but I don't have enough time for that. Instead, I'm going to quickly go over the most important points.

* The replacement fee for a room key is $75 (as much as a week and a half of food), and they'll charge you $25 to let you into your room if you somehow get locked out after dark. Considering that I am paying \~$1600 per month to live here, this is ridiculous.
* There is effectively no soundproofing between apartments and between rooms.
   * Also, don't walk around barefoot, otherwise your feet will probably pull the plastic flooring up.
* You have to pay for laundry and printing, which is explicitly something that Lightview explicitly said that they would not do, but here we are. In fact, the laundry there is a fifty cents more expensive per load than in NEU student housing.
* If you're someone who is concerned about security, the security at Lightview is effectively ""do you look like a college student?"" The keys work using an RFID, the same way that Husky Cards work, so Husky Cards make a ""beep"" sound at Lightview's scanners, even though they won't work. Many people have made it a game to get into the building without using your key at all, by waiting for someone to let you through the door, beeping your husky card at the proctor scanner (which is, strangely enough, on the other side of the desk from the proctor and therefore out of view), and waiting for someone else with a valid key to activate the elevator then pressing your floor number when they do. Also, the apartment and room doors don't lock automatically like they do in student housing. Basically, if you have a stalker, and your roommate didn't lock the door, that stalker could get into your bedroom in about sixty seconds without ever having to use any kind of key or ID. I sure know I could.

American Campus Communities, the company that made and manages Lightview, spent 50% on their budget on marketing and appearance and the other 50% on actually making things work. Right now, they're freaking out and are pushing us residents to renew our leases, offering huge prizes for our participation in surveys that ask why we aren't. Here is the most concise reason why I'm not: I'm not paying money for good marketing; I'm paying it so that I don't have to think about things that might distract me from schoolwork. Lightview has succeeded at this in two areas: they let you leave for co-op, and rent covers utilities. These are not small things, and I'm happy they exist, but given the cost, I expect more.",dj7y7g,NEU

The disappointment that is Lightview. A slight rant,127,51,"So for all of you are looking to vent about how we were promised a luxury experience and received plastic couches and tiny rooms, and for everyone looking to move here in the future, let’s give some clarity into what lightview is. It’s an apartment that is essentially a dorm room that you pay significantly more for. Because you need to have your own renters insurance, lightview isn’t liable for a lot of things that could go wrong. The rooms are much smaller than we were led to believe and you can’t tell that the building was put up in less than 2 years. The walls are paper thin so you better hope that your neighbors aren’t loudly fucking all the time. Starting at the end of next week, we not only will have to tap in through the front door, and at the security desk. We will also need to tap to operate the elevators. You can hear the water running through the walls when anybody above you flushed the toilet or showers and they are already beginning to change their policies. Northeastern is now requiring that lightview change their policy on signing in guests and they are also changing their strange, but welcomed smoking in the rooms policy. The kitchens have almost no storage and although the closets are large, the credenzas are not, so be sure to bring your own storage solution. The beds are large but stiff so a mattress pad is probably a necessity, and the lights are on motion sensors so be sure to turn them off before going to bed or you’ll be turning all the lights on in the apartment when you get up to use the bathroom. The nicest and largest rooms are definitely the 4 bedroom, 4 bath, but the kitchen has no more space than a smaller room arrangement. The facilities are nice, but I emailed 3 times about the on site gym to see if it would be fully equipped with free weights and every time they assured me it would be. The gym has no free weight bench set or squat rack. There is one smith machine and dumbbells that only go up to 75 pounds. This is likely for safety reasons so the gym can be open 24/7 but still. I was excited to have an on site bench press. The WiFi is very good, but still slower than promised and I have yet to try out the cable package. Overall, a lot of us are downgrading from our on campus housing and are spending a lot more money. Yeah it comes fully furnished, but it’s really shitty furniture and the cable and internet packages are nice, but still not worth the up to $1800 per month price tag on the most expensive rooms. For much cheaper, I could’ve gotten off campus housing that I would’ve been much happier in. Hopefully this year will fly by because I will not be resigning next September.",cvqypf,NEU

Just got my first year housing assignment back,9,20," McCormick Road Triple first year....I'm pretty disappointed not gonna lie.

I know I can't get everything I wanted since dorm space is limited but, I still wasn't able to get a single one of my first choice selections.

So my question is, is there any way to switch housing assignments before or after the semester starts if vacancies appear (in the email it said no vacancies are available right now)? Should I email them? Talk to my counselor person at orientation? I have no idea. Some friends who are rising second years at UVA have been sending me nonstop Ls since the assignment came out...I really want at least just a double room, although suite would be ideal (seriously doubt that one since I heard there's very limited space for suite). But from what I've been hearing, it seems like I'll have to live with what they gave me.

Two Roommates with a Sweet JPA House (RIGHT across from Rice) Looking for Third,6,3,"Hello, my mate and I just secured a lease opportunity for an amazing house right across from Rice Hall (literally right across it). Amazing full kitchen, living room, porch, modern appliances, and an open parking spot included. Utilities not included. Price is around $670 per month without utilities (which we would split).

This would be amazing for anyone who has a lot of classes anywhere on Engineering Way or in Rice espicially. If you are seriously interested let me know and we can arrange a tour! Thank you.

I heard The Lawn has no climate control, but liked that the rooms are private and looked cool from the pictures on the website. I don’t mind walking down the hall outside to a shared bathroom. The Lawn sounded fun, but Brown has AC. Since I’ll only be there a week and am flying from Honolulu, I won’t be bringing an oscillating fan ...  I read there are cross-breezes and ceiling fans, and wonder if anyone who has stayed there in summer months could tell me how comfortable it is/was without AC? I have the ability to change my reservation, but am not sure I want to give up The Lawn since I’ve read some articles about the architecture and history and it seems really cool.

AMA 2019-2020 Housing at International Residential College,4,5,"Are you a prospective first year, transfer, or current UVA student who needs housing for the 2019-2020 school year? Then the International Residential College (IRC) may be the place for you! We are home to 317 residents from all backgrounds. We are made up of 30% international, 70% domestic students (many of whom are from out of state). Many languages are spoken within the IRC.

If you are a prospective first year or transfer student, you will apply through the housing portal.

If you are a current uva student, then we still have some spaces open left over from the normal application pool as we admit on the basis of the quality of the application and fit of the applicant, not on filling spaces. If you believe that you would be a good fit for our last remaining spaces, then please email housingassignments@virginia.edu to be out in official contact with me with regards to your application. Please DM me with any questions at all about the IRC or the application!


*Accommodations*
Mary Munford is the only dorm/building on grounds that has a mailroom, laundry room, and printer (all in one!). There’s a ping pong table, study spaces (rooms that you can actually reserve to take tests, etc.), kitchens for each hall. There’s a main kitchen that you can reserve in the first floor of Mary Munford for events that you want to hold. In fact, you can use the IRC or RA budget to hold your own events, which is great! Many residents have taken advantage of this to celebrate their own cultures/backgrounds. Our board game and library collections are quite extensive too!

*WEEKLY EVENTS*
We have weekly food events (of course!)
3 breakfasts (monday muffins, wednesday petite dejeuner, Friday bodos bagels--the best bagels out there), and then thursday tea time. We also have The Week That Was (political discussions about the past week with snacks), which is our longest running tradition at the IRC. I ran it last spring semester, and it’s always really lit.

*Typical semesterly events*
Then there are also the IRC's monthly fancy dinner parties called Conversazion Grande dinners, weekly lunches that you can sign up for with IRC fellow professors and random professors that the IRC recruits (with food from the garden room, so it's good), laissez lire (book club) dinners, language club events, pop up cafes (random and quite unpredictable). We also have sporadic intramural sports competitions and cultural movie nights. But wait! There’s more! We also have ""out and abouts"" which are events where the IRC dean or principal takes us out to different places around Cville (plays, movies, etc.) or beyond (like I'm going to Poplar Forest pretty soon) for free, which is super fun.

*Seasonal/Holiday events*
CultureMonth events happen in the fall (different cultural/ethnic organizations appearing to perform/celebrate their cultures) throughout September. We always do Thanksgiving, which is super big (every hall makes their own dishes. We tend to do Japan Day with Japan Club, but aren’t this year. We’re currently planning on hosting a Holi Celebration (with powder throwing, catered Indian food, and s'mores to follow) with HSC and ISA, which will be phenomenal. New this spring semester is IRC Day (which is like IRC month from the fall but part two and in the spring). We had a cute Murder Mystery event that we hosted and invited kids from the other res. colleges. There’s a spring ping pong tournament coming up. I think we're also doing a Merienda (light snacks and music) event with Spanish house. We also just had an event this semester on discussing race and identity at UVA following recent events that happened at UVA and in Virginia (http://www.nbc29.com/clip/14758062/where-do-we-go-from-here-chaos-or-community-event-held-on-uva-grounds). We’re planning *low key* on having an event about Brexit, all arranged by the IRC’s principal, Reid Bailey. We had a Talking Traditions event in the fall semester, munching on a weird marshmallow-graham-crackers-brownies mixture that I made while talking about going home and what we tend to do, religiously or otherwise, with our families.

*Unofficial fun that we have*
We have a lot of unofficial things; but the first years this year have nerf wars all of the time. We also have a lot of ping pong tournaments and random discussions/monopoly games in the ~fishbowl~ at late hours of the morning. There are many FIFA tournaments in the ~Klazzroom~. 

*Fun facts*
Did you know? The IRC is very committed to sustainability. In fact, we compost the most out of all of the dorms/res colleges on grounds (many of them don’t even compost).
We are the newest residential college on grounds! But we’re still rocking it!

*HOO are we looking for?*
We look for people who are open to multiculturalism, seem like they will get involved/benefit from IRC events, and understand the values of the IRC (diversity, integrity, openness, inclusion, expression of oneself and one's culture).

A Note to First Years about On-Grounds Housing,42,21,"Hello first-years. I know talk about housing fills the walls of Newcomb, dorms, and wherever else you young kids gather these days. I want to pass along a friendly note about living on Grounds after your first year. A few things:

1. HRL says it's cheaper: Ehhhhhhhh. Depends. If you are comparing it to Uncommon, the Flats, one another one of those bougie places, sure. Do consider that even though the rent might seem cheaper than some budget Off Grounds options, you only have access to the apartment for 200ish days instead of the usual 365 day lease. Go and break down the rent for on Grounds housing to a per day rate then multiply it by 365. I find this as a better way to compare rents. Do, of course, remember that rent off-Grounds housing sometimes does and does not include utiltites, so make sure to factor that in as well. One thing that on Grounds rent sure doesn't include is...
2. Parking. You will pay $414 to have your car on Grounds for the academic year. Again, this is less compared to some places on the Corner but there are many off Grounds options that don't charge you this ridiculous amount of money to park on a piece of asphalt that is never maintained other than for a Parking and Transportation staff member to come five minutes before the parking restrictions are lifted and write your friends who are visiting you a parking ticket. 
3. If you live in Faulkner or Copeley, the whole idea of staying connected to the UVA community is a lie. Living in either of those places is so isolating because sure, you are technically still on Grounds, but unless you are friends with lots of Darden and Law students, you sure are going to feel extremely separated from the UVA community just because you are so far away from everything. 

I hope this helps. ",9io5tm,UVA

So what do I do? Should I apply both to the houses I named above AND to be an RA at the same time (I know RA's live in the dorm they are RA's for)? Is it still possible to go random for roommate? When should I start applying? Should I wait until I meet a few more people to make a decision?

Having a hard time searching for an affordable apartment.,3,24,"(I'm not sure if this is the right place, mods: if this isn't please let me know)

Hi,

I'll be interning at the UVa's CS department during the fall of 2019. Since it is standard policy for UVa to not allow interns to rent out on-grounds housing I am searching for an appropriate sublet (\~$600, not far from Rice Hall) for last 2 months or so with no luck. I would land in the states on Aug 21 and would stay till the end of this year.

Since Aug 21 is very close, I'm really worried about finding an apartment. And, since I'm not in Cville I'm limited mostly to facebook group where people prefer long lease signers...

The places I've looked so far that are close and around $600 have major issues:

1. Eagle Landing, shamrock apartments, UHeights: Really terrible reviews.
2. West Village - Out of budget.

Any suggestion/advice on my apartment search would be really appreciated. I don't have any issue with things like double occupancy, but I'm not sure how I would trust signing a lease and making a security deposit while I'm in a different country.

First Year Housing,6,11,"How worth it is Brown College? I’m an out of state student who is considering Brown.

Incoming UVA First-Year looking for some housing advice,11,10,"This August, I'll be attending UVA, and I'm beyond excited to get the ball rolling.  That being said, with housing applications opening up soon, I wanted to get some input from current/former students on housing options.

First off, while I am a first year, I'll be coming in as a veteran. I was only in for 3 years (I'm 22) so I don't think the age gap will be as big of an issue for me as it could be.  We had the option to live on or off grounds.  I don't necessarily like to go out and party 24/7, but I am a social person and I love meeting and interacting with new people and developing a large social circle so I felt like living on grounds was the best choice for me.

While graduate housing was an option, from what I gather, it's not very close to much so I don't think I'll strongly consider that.

I had the opportunity to speak to some current residents of Brown, and I really like the idea of living there for the culture and the location.  Beyond that however, I'm not 100% sure what people who are familiar with the different housing options recommend.

Just something to consider, I'm able to mark first-year or upperclassman housing options as a preference (I don't know how much they'll take that into consideration), but I think that upperclassman housing seems like a better bet, unless there's a really solid reason why I should go the first-year route.

Thanks!",88kcdv,UVA
Looking for some graduate housing advice,6,7,"I'm going to be starting at UVA this fall for the M. Arch program, but I'm still trying to figure out my housing situation, unfortunately. I received an email today offering me a room in Copeley Hill Apartment, but from what I've read, it sounds like it's not the best place to live. I was also hoping to live within walking distance to the architecture building if possible. 

My concern, though, is that in searching through this sub briefly, it sounds like I'm pretty late in the game and that most people have already figured out fall housing at this point. If I haven't secured off-grounds housing yet, am I going to be out of luck trying to find it now? If that's the case, it sounds like I should pull the trigger on the Copeley Hill, since their offer expires in two days. 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!",8lyhvr,UVA

How Do I Have A Better Time At UF?,71,42,"Redditor's of UF:

I'm an out of state student from Pennsylvania. I came to UF because my total cost of attendance is slightly lower than the cost of the PA schools I got into (especially for the first year). I also really enjoyed the campus culture when I visited. Furthermore, the school was relatively competitive in the Major I applied for.

Since coming here, I have switched majors.  I've also been involved in a class // activity that has taken up quite a bit of time (like 6-18 hours a week). I've really enjoyed that activity so far but it has been a lot of work.

Since Being here I haven't really made that many close friends. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong. It just seems all the people I've met are so different down here. I have friends, but none in particular that I would likely talk to after this year//after college.

All in all, I feel like I'm just not having much fun here. I feel, in general, over worked and under partied. I've always heard about people saying how college is the best time of your life but I'm confused. Does the fun part come later? I'm personally not a big fan of clubs, but I haven't been to many house parties since I've been here. I've thought about maybe joining the club team for the sport I did in high school, or maybe joining a frat.  I've also considered transferring back to a school in PA.  Back home I had a good system of work hard and party hard. Here It's been mostly work. I don't know if I'm describing this well but if anyone has been in a similar situation and has advice it is much needed right now.

Edit: I feel like I was a little ambiguous and I should clarify a few things. I'm currently in marching band, but I don't have that much of an interest in joining the service frat as I'm only friendly with a couple of the people in it and I don't really wanna commit to band that much. Back home, I went mountain biking and hiking quite a bit. I also raced in Pittsburgh's ""Dirty Dozen"" every fall, which was a bike race up the 13 steepest hills there (A quick YouTube search can bring you some entertainment). So if anyone knows and good Outdoors clubs, or is in contact with anyone on Team Florida Cycling, I'd love to hear from you guys.

The thing is that we've talked to a lot of agencies and student apartments near the campus, but they all seem to offer their domestic units unfurnished and without the daily life essentials (water, light, internet...), which sounds horrible to cope with for us that aren't even living in the US. Not only that, but the prices they ask for are a bit elevated (700$ per person and month without the essential things I previously mentioned). The last ones we've been contacting with are L3Apartments and College Park Apartments.

Now that I've overcome a lot of that social anxiety, I realize the mistake I made. I have enjoyed the freedom and having my own room but obviously social life has suffered. Next year, I won't be living with him, and NYU won't let me pick a room with friends since I didn't live on-campus. Therefore NYU is just going to give me options based on whatever space is left.

Housing Accommodations Deadline,5,1,"I'm an admitted Class of 2023 student (I know everyone on this sub is tired of hearing that so I'm sorry), and I have several disabilities that I will need accommodated if I attend NYU.

"Studying CompSci in the UK, what's the best route to end up with a NYC MSc?​",10,3,"Hey guys,

I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).

I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).

I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 60K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - **which one of the five is the most highly regarded in the US**? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?

Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?

Commuting from Long Island?,12,18,"First year applicant here. I guess it’s kinda Risky™️ to reveal where I’m from but Long Island is big and I’m sure NYU gets a ton of apps from here. The commute takes about an hour and 45 mins via public transportation on a typical day. I feel like that might be too much. I did a program at NYU and the commute was pretty exhausting and I was spending nearly 4 hours of my day just sitting on trains. A lot of Long Islanders do the same commute but they’re mostly people who go to the city for their 9 to 5 jobs so it’s not like they have to study and what not. I feel like college is too rigorous for me to spend all that time on trains. It’ll cost me so much time to study, and also to sleep!! And I’ve already heard people complain about commuting to NYU from Queens, which has to be at most half of the time of my commute (I’ve gone to NYC from Queens multiple times so I know). At the same time, tuition is already so expensive, I don’t see myself getting good financial aid, so idk if an additional like $20k is worth it when the commute is at least doable.

TLDR: if my commute to NYC campus from where I live is almost 2 hours (4 hours a day going and coming) will dorming be worth the additional cost?

Also, you don’t have to live nearby NYU or know what it’s like commuting to answer. That would give the best insight, but just knowing how much time you spend on campus studying, what scheduling classes is like, etc, is good enough for good insight.",clmaxy,nyu

These two quotes seem contradicting to me lol maybe I just suck at reading contracts.

So when do I actually pay this fee, upon submitting the application (but not receiving any offers yet) or upon receiving AND accepting the offer (if there is one)? If it's the former, then I'm worried I might end up having to pay $1000 when I submit the application but then not get an offer later.

"A senior's guide to NYU: tips, tricks, and little things (including how to save some money)",165,21,"I've posted some of these [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/9aac3j/nyu_getting_started_guide_tips_tricks_and_advice/) and figured I could ~~do some karmawhoring~~ update my guide to help all the incoming students this year. You're about to begin an \~exciting\~ chapter of your lives and there's a lot to learn, nobody can teach you everything but hopefully this can help you all feel a little more safe, confident, and save a little bit of cash. This is mostly oriented towards freshman but transfers and returning students might still have something to learn.

# The most important thing

Realize everybody is as nervous as you! College is fucking scary and everybody is trying to look more confident than they really are as they try to settle in and make friends. Don't be afraid to push yourself into engaging with as many groups and individuals as you can during the first few weeks. It might look like friend groups have already formed after only a day or two (""oh man, those guys have already grabbed dinner twice and have been playing poker all night, no way I can squeeze in now"") but everything will be very fluid for the first few months so don't worry if you haven't found your groove off the bat. Sometimes hanging out with people you don't totally 'click' with can lead you to meet people who become your true friends later on. Also don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself or coming off weird—everybody is too busy adjusting to their new environment to care. It's cliche but be yourself, campus is big enough that you'll find the right crew for your weird-ass self.

# Safety

Honestly, the city (and especially the village) is pretty safe. Regardless, there's some hazards to watch out for, especially the goddamn delivery bicyclists. I really do think they're the biggest danger to NYU students right now; they'll sneak up on you at 20+mph going the wrong way on the street so please look up from your phone and look both ways. It's a touchy subject because many of them are undocumented citizens looking for stable income, speaking of which always tip in cash if you get seamless delivery to your dorm like the lazy ass you are. 


**Street Smahts** 

There are a ton of scammers on the street and people generally looking to get *something* out of you, **never** make eye contact with anyone and just keep walking. Trust me. That woman asking for $4.50 for a bus ticket home? She's there every day. Kids asking for money for their school team? There's no team. Etc, etc. New Yorkers are a jaded but very helpful bunch, if you need something don't start with ""Excuse me"" but just ask directly like ""Which way to X"".

Everything else about the safety in the city you'll have hammered into your minds so I won't touch on it. 

**Booze**

It's everywhere. We know it, the police know it, the RAs know it, and everybody sort of turns a blind eye as long as you're not being too obvious. Please don't be the kid leaving in an ambulance on a Friday night because it happens regularly. The best way to not get a hangover is to drink a glass of water between every shot or can of beer, and don't buy that disgusting ~~liquor~~ gasoline in plastic bottles or god forbid, Chateau Diana from Duane Read  (they can't legally sell wine so it's half strength ""wine product""). Shame anybody who buys that crap. 

Freshmen tend to have a ""go hard or go home"" attitude about alcohol but chilling with some wine/beer and playing boardgames or watching a movie is very underrated and usually ends up being a better time than dragging your ass to whatever shitty clubs are letting in freshmen. 

**Weed**

I'm not saying cartridges are the superior option...but cartridges are the superior option. If you get caught with one I don't know how you got into NYU, and even then you can say it's CBD and all they can do is shrug. But hey, it's NYC and the police DGAF so again, don't be dumb about it if you buy bud. Just please don't become *that kid* who is high 24/7 and lost all motivation in life.

# Money Money Money 💸

⚠️**STOP BUYING TEXTBOOKS** ⚠️

For the LOVE of GOD please check libgen.is for your books before giving any money to the greedy fucks who run the textbook racket. If that URL goes down search for 'library genesis'. If you can't find your book there, you can google ""Book Name filetype:pdf"" but if you hit a site with a survey don't bother. If you like physical copies, Bobst tends to keep some copies of textbooks used for classes so alternatively you can try to reserve it as soon as the syllabus comes out (sorry if I just ruined this for anyone). 

**Don't buy microsoft office**

Please don't spend money on Microsoft Office. Create an account with your NYU email [here](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) and once you sign in, look for [this](https://i.imgur.com/5nLjxDL.png) button to download office for free to your laptop.

**Get a credit card**

This is a bit of a weird one because it's very easy to *lose* money with one, but hear me out. Starting to build credit now and graduating with a 700+ credit score will help you out a ton when buying a car, a house, refinancing anything, etc. Not to mention you can get cashback rewards and better consumer protections, just treat it like a debit card, pay your bill every month, and don't spend what you don't have. I recommend the Discover It card, they give out $20 a year for having good grades and there's decent rewards. 

**Budget appeal**

Hidden within Albert is a budget appeal form, it's *intended* for special circumstances but I've heard of them tossing a couple thousand someone's way every semester if you just say ""yo...shit's expensive"" (well realistically it depends on your FAFSA results but mentioning the burden of college on your family/yourself typically works if those numbers are in your favor).

# College Lyfe

**Go abroad** 

I initially thought I wouldn't do it but after going to London I would 100% recommend it. NYU is insanely invested in campuses overseas and it would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. It really does feel like a vacation, nobody has jobs or club leadership obligations so everybody is always down to hang out and travel. Plus the tight global campuses can give you a taste of the small college life you gave up by going here. 

**Clubs**

Absolutely join some clubs and even angle yourself for a leadership position if you find a group of people you'd like working with, I didn't do this as much as I'd like and I do regret it. On the flip side, don't spread yourself too thin and only have one foot in the water—you're not doing yourself or anybody else any favors then. 

**Long Distance Relationships UwU**

I'm not pretending to be an expert but I've seen some nasty breakups between long-distance couples in college, mostly in the first semester. But I've also seen some successes and even an engagement so don't give up if you think you have something special. Just be real with yourself and your partner, if you're not rock solid before college it's probably not the best move to keep it going, people change during college and trying to cling to something just because you've already put in so much time/effort only leads to pain. 

**Don't stand in the fucking way**

Space is tight in NYC and if you or a group of people stand around on a busy sidewalk or after getting through a door/escalator/elevator you'll become the most hated person on the planet for a moment. Please have some situational awareness.

#Misc.

**Make a custom email alias**

At [NYU Home](http://home.nyu.edu) in the top right corner > settings you can set a custom email alias to use with your assigned NetID email account, *first.last@nyu.edu* is a common one to use on resumes and whatnot. You also get to keep it after graduating so don't be afraid to use it far and wide...just don't change it or you're *screwed*. 

**Download CityMapper**

Best way to get around, no question. Handles the service interruptions like a champ. 

**Boba Guys > Kung Fu Tea** 

Don't @ me. Formosa tea over at Mi Tea on Macdougal is fire as well. 

That's all I got, good luck!",cv4xru,nyu

"I finally graduated, so here's my favorite bathrooms at NYU:",191,24,"(note: this list is not comprehensive)

&#x200B;

* Hands down, THE BEST bathroom I've ever found at NYU is in the Steinhardt music building (35 W 4th Street), 2nd floor next to the study lounge. This is a hotel lobby quality bathroom. Extremely clean, everything is automatic (and actually works), and it's single stall so you can shit to your heart's content. There is also an occupied thing on the lock so people know not to knock.  The study lounge next to it is quite nice as well if you need a place to study. A true hidden gem. 5/5
* Also, the basement of 35 W 4th has a nice, clean bathroom that is rarely used. 4/5
* Kimmel: the hidden one by the elevators is nice enough, but too many people know about it now. It offers double shield protection as it is one stall hidden by a door that locks. But whenever I go there, I find that people try and open the door, making it a somewhat stressful experience if you know you're going to be in there a long time. 3/5
* The best bathrooms in the Kimmel-GCASL complex are the single stall ones in the hallway between Kimmel and GCASL. They have the hotel lobby design and seem luxurious, but they are a little more heavily trafficked, so they are not as clean as they could be. Still, really nice bathrooms if you can snag one during class times. I'm pretty sure they are on floors 2-5. 4.5/5
* The basement of GCASL also has a nice bathroom that is less trafficked than the ones above it. Do recommend even though there are multiple stalls. 4/5
* Bobst bathrooms are absolute trash, avoid these at all costs.  If you need to go to a bathroom in Bobst, the only thing to do is go to the 10th floor where there are less people. But still, pretty much every bathroom in Bobst is terrible. 1/5
* Almost every residence hall has a single stall bathroom SOMEWHERE on its first or second floor. I know that 3N, UHall, Greenwich, Alumni, Palladium, Senior House, Rubin all have it. The only one I've tried to search but couldn't find was Weinstein (not talking about that monstrosity in the basement). Most of these you can only access if you're in NYU housing though. Quality varies, none are the best or the worst though.
* The art building (on Stuyvesant street past Alumni) has single stall bathrooms on every floor. These are pretty nice bathrooms, except some of the automatic functions on the toilets can be wonky. They also have free pads and tampons in stock. 4/5
* The Gallatin building has two single stall bathrooms on every floor. I cannot guarantee this because I haven't been to every floor, but it definitely exists on the 5th and 6th floors. These are okay, nothing great or terrible to say about these bathrooms. 3.5/5
* Another gem that I've found is in a building that I can't quite remember the name of, but it's on that block of like  Silver, Torch Club, and Starbucks on Waverly. I'm pretty sure it has the department of Systems Biology or something like that. Anyway, if you go in there, then go past the elevators and take a right, you will find two single stall bathrooms that are spotless. Amazingly clean when I went. 5/5
* The Data Science building on 5th Ave and 13th street has single stall restrooms on the first floor. Also has an underrated study lounge. These bathrooms are on par with the GCASL ones. 4.5/5
* Avoid the Silver bathrooms unless you just have to pee. 
* Have heard amazing things about the law school bathrooms but I cannot confirm for myself.",bszfyg,nyu

There is space to have two beds, but it would be incredibly crammed due to the tall bureaus.

What is a good excuse that I could use in order to get the smaller bureaus that go under the beds?

Should I say that my roommate and I both have acrophobia? Should I fake a leg injury? What would be the most believable excuse to ask for the smaller bureaus?
